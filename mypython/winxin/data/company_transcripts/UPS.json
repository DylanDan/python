At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. And, as a reminder, today's call will be recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Good morning, and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectation for the future performance or results of operation of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2015 Form 10-K and the 2016 Form 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "During the quarter, UPS recorded a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $1.7 billion. The charge resulted from lower discount rates and asset returns. Lower interest rates used to calculate the plan discount rate contributed to the bulk of the shortfall. In addition, investment returns on plan assets were negatively affected by the overall market performance.", "In the prior year period, UPS recorded a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $79 million. The charge resulted from lower asset returns that were partially offset by higher discount rates. More details on mark-to-market accounting are available in a presentation on the Investor Relations' website.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2016 was a loss of $0.27. Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market pension charge, adjusted earnings per share was $1.63, while fourth quarter 2015 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.48 and adjusted earnings per share was $1.57. Unless stated otherwise, discussion today will refer to adjusted results.", "The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations' website.", "Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.", "Before I turn it over to David, I want to remind everyone of our Investor Conference on February 21. UPS senior leaders will update you on our latest technology and our long-term strategy. We look forward to seeing you at the conference.", "Now, I will turn the call over to David.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. UPS produced record earnings in 2016, and revenue reached an all-time high of $61 billion. We completed the initial stages of our long-term investment strategy, which enabled UPS to accelerate e-commerce and international shipment growth in the second half of 2016.", "For the fourth quarter, the International segment delivered another extraordinary performance, with shipment growth exceeding 7% and operating profit rising by double digits for the eighth consecutive quarter.", "Over the last two years, our International business has built a strong foundation, generating 30% incremental profit growth. This positive momentum in our core International business model will continue going forward.", "Looking specifically at peak season, UPS helped our customers complete another successful holiday season. We delivered more than 712 million packages globally, a 16% increase over the same period last year. This record volume was driven by strong and steady e-commerce demand throughout the period. Our embrace and, in reality, our facilitation of the e-commerce boom offers even more growth and earnings potential as we further transform our network. We will continue to invest in air and ground capacity and operating efficiency improvements in order to fully capitalize on the e-commerce growth with an improved bottom line.", "In the U.S., we completed investments that enabled our network to respond with on-time service, even with this record-setting volume. However, during the quarter, we experienced a significant shift in mix toward lower revenue products. This, combined with the cost of facility investments yet to come online, weighed on our Q4 results.", "In 2016, we completed nearly 200 facility projects and announced about 7 million square feet of new capacity. This included a dozen all-new facility or major modernization investments. And we are moving rapidly towards completion of many of these projects.", "During the fourth quarter, we announced substantial hub modernization in (6:36) greenfield expansion projects. These and other investments will create improved network flexibility to address e-commerce mix and generate greater operating efficiency and enhance profitability. In Atlanta, we unveiled our largest current project, a new 1.2 million square foot facility. This highly-automated $400 million ground hub will be our third largest sortation facility in the network.", "We also announced projects at two large regional hubs in Ohio and Florida. These high-priority facilities will expand network capacity and utilize the most advanced sortation technology available. The capacity and efficiency benefits from these latest projects will come online over the next two years.", "In Europe, we've already completed one-third of our $2 billion network expansion and redesign program. Many of these investments are starting to contribute to our strong International segment performance. We have more announcements planned as part of our U.S. and European investment programs in the coming months.", "We are also executing inorganic strategies to drive growth across key industries, building additional capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships. We added new health care capabilities with the acquisition of Marken, a global provider of supply chain solutions to the life sciences industry. Marken's 44 locations, combined with our pre-existing health care network, makes UPS a leader in clinical trials logistics. We now operate more than 100 dedicated health care locations worldwide.", "We also acquired Freightex, a U.K.-based asset-light provider of truckload brokerage services. This acquisition gives us a great expansion platform in Europe for the Coyote business model.", "In addition, we entered a partnership with Optoro, a reverse logistics technology company. This alliance creates a comprehensive return solution that extends our reach within the retail and manufacturing sectors. It's a powerful combination of logistics know-how and data analytics to minimize returns costs and complexity. The addition of these unique capabilities gives UPS unmatched global solutions across industry verticals.", "Now looking at 2017, the global economic outlook remains generally positive, and forecasts have risen modestly over the last few months. In the U.S., GDP growth for 2017 is forecast to be slightly higher than last year. The expansion of e-commerce is expected to continue, with another year of double-digit growth. On the commercial side of the economy, industrial production outlook has gone from negative to slightly positive. That favorable move is a good sign for the manufacturing sector.", "However, U.S. exports are expected to face continued headwinds from a strong U.S. dollar. Global growth estimates for 2017 have been largely unchanged. The outlook for both Europe and China has rebounded slightly, although economists are still expecting slower year-over-year growth.", "We believe a key to continued global economic growth is the expansion of free trade. UPS supports trade initiatives that give our customers fair and simplified access to markets outside their home country. We support the move towards additional bilateral, as well as multilateral, trade agreements that give improved access to international markets. UPS is ready to help our customers navigate this period of change using the expertise we've developed as one of the world's largest customs brokers.", "In the U.S., a new political era has begun, and we look forward to working with the Trump administration and Congress. We expect the economy will be center stage, along with efforts to strengthen U.S. competitiveness. There are opportunities for progress on a number of critical issues that impact economic growth.", "At UPS, we strongly support comprehensive corporate tax reform. Lower corporate tax rates will encourage investment, create jobs, and make the U.S. a more competitive country. We believe the case for infrastructure development is clear. A world-class infrastructure is the backbone of a modern healthy U.S. economy, and it will certainly reduce costly delays for UPS. In addition, reduction of Federal regulations will also make the U.S. economy more vibrant.", "UPS supports a streamlined and targeted regulatory environment, reducing uncertainty and producing better conditions for growth. We are encouraged by these prospects and look forward to offering input as specific proposals are developed and implemented.", "Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to personally thank all UPSers around the world for their dedication and extraordinary efforts during the holiday season. As we begin 2017, we're optimistic about our future. We see great opportunities ahead for UPS. We are strengthening our network and market position by making investments that create long-term value for customers and share owners.", "Now, Richard will provide you more details on our results. Richard?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. During the fourth quarter, UPS produced strong revenue growth of 5.5%. Top-line gains were driven by the opportunities in e-commerce and robust international shipment growth. Earnings per share came in at $1.63. And full year 2016 EPS was $5.75, an almost 6% increase over last year.", "International continues to lead the way, completing its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit profit expansion. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered record volumes and adjusted to a historical shift of product mix. Finally, Supply Chain & Freight grew top line, tonnage, and shipments, but is still managing through tough market conditions.", "Now, turning to details within each business segment. U.S. Domestic revenue was up 6.3% to $10.9 billion in the quarter. Fuel revenue was a benefit to the top line growth by about 20 basis points.", "Package growth was strong the quarter. Its average daily volume was up 5%. Ground products were up 5.4%, driven by more than a 25% jump in SurePost volume. We also had solid gains in our Air products. Next Day Air shipments increased 4.4%, and Deferred Air was up almost 3%.", "Strong market demand for our e-commerce solutions created a significant shift in product mix during the quarter. B2C shipments grew at 11.5%. We reached a number of historic levels during the quarter, including 55% B2C, the largest volume increase in a quarter and the highest month ever at 63% B2C in December.", "We also delivered to an additional 2.5 million new addresses this quarter. These UPS records demonstrate the expanding reach of e-commerce, which comes with great opportunities and some challenges.", "On the commercial delivery side of the business, B2B shipments were down slightly. Growth in return shipments was double-digit. However, commercial activity remained soft, including brick-and-mortar deliveries. Weak industrial production trends, revenue management actions on a handful of large accounts, and a strong U.S. dollar were all headwinds in the quarter.", "Looking at operating expense, average delivery stops increased 4.6% and average daily volume was up 5%. Yet through the power of ORION, we held daily package miles to only a 0.3% increase.", "Total cost per piece growth was held to 0.6% including a 0.3% impact from fuel. Given all these factors, overall profits fell below our expectations, as the balance of e-commerce shipments affected our bottom line. As a result, operating profit was relatively flat at $1.3 billion for the quarter.", "We are mid-cycle in transforming our network over the next several years, as we move through this period of expanding e-commerce opportunity. As investments come online, we are adding capacity, more efficiency and greater flexibility. With the e-commerce opportunity, we recognize additional revenue initiatives are needed to better align price with our cost to serve. This is a dynamic process to ensure that we are properly compensated for changes in product mix and the cost to manage volume surges through the year. We are using this multi-pronged approach to build upon our results.", "Looking now at the International segment, our business model is creating value for our customers and shareholders, with eight quarters of consistent double-digit profit gains, resulting in almost $600 million in incremental profits since 2014.", "Total operating profit climbed more than 13% to over $700 million for the quarter, another record level for the segment. Operating margin was strong and expanded year-over-year. This quarter's margin benefited by approximately 300 basis points due to the hedging gains. The total revenue was $3.3 billion, or up 5%, and up 6.2% on a currency-neutral basis.", "Export shipments were up 8.4%. Results were driven by strong growth across a number of regions and products. The Asia region was up 20%. And intra-Europe exports saw over a 10% increase, showcasing the strong foundation of our broad cross-border network.", "Finally, the Supply Chain & Freight segment continued to manage through soft market conditions. More specifically, the Forwarding and Freight units remained challenged by overcapacity in the market. In the Forwarding business, tonnage increased in Air and Ocean Freight for the first time in more than a year. The unit saw mid-single-digit growth in tonnage for Air Freight, but narrowing buy-sell spreads in the quarter. Ocean Freight produced strong results, as tonnage and profits increase year-over-year. UPS Freight returned to growth, producing modest increases in revenue, tonnage and shipments.", "We remain focused on profitable revenue and growing our middle-market customer base. Growth in (18:36) logistics continues to outpace the general market. They are creating customer value with their high service levels and through expanded access to the full suite of UPS capabilities. The acquisition of Coyote was a great addition to UPS, providing us with the unique technology platform, strong adjacent market growth, and it was accretive in year one.", "Now, let's turn to our cash flow. Once again, UPS returned more than 100% of net income to shareholders, as we purchased more than 25.5 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid out another $2.8 billion in dividends, up about 7% per share over last year.", "Through 2016, UPS generated healthy cash from operations, producing over $6.5 billion. We reinvested just under $3 billion in our business this year as well. Also in the fourth quarter, we made an opportunistic discretionary payment to fund pension liabilities for approximately $1 billion, basically taking advantage of the rate arbitrage around increasing PBGC premiums.", "Looking at our tax rate, in the fourth quarter, UPS lowered the effective tax rate to 34.5%. International profit growth, combined with adjustments for several discrete tax events, produced these savings. For 2017, we expect our tax rate to remain around 35%.", "Now, let's cover the rest of guidance. At our Investor Conference in three weeks, we'll provide more details on our plans for 2017 and update you on our expectations through 2019. Today, we are providing a high-level view of where UPS is headed in 2017.", "We've enjoyed the advantages of multi-year hedging over the last few years. And 2017, as we have discussed, is a transition year. With the strength of the U.S. dollar, we now anticipate a combined headwind from hedged and unhedged currencies of about $400 million for the year.", "We expect total revenue to grow 5% to 7% ahead of our historical norms. We are adapting to the on-going growth of e-commerce, and we are leaning into this opportunity. As a result, we will be moving our CapEx target range in 2017. CapEx is expected to be around $4 billion for the year. These additional investment dollars will give us more capacity and greater efficiency in both our Air and Ground networks.", "Elevating our CapEx, given our high ROIC, and continuing to be opportunistic with capital, we are increasing our long-term shareholder value. We remain committed to growing dividends and expect, based on our current view, share repurchases to be around $1.8 billion for the year. It's important to remember that the currency headwinds will impact operating profit by about $400 million this year, and that reduces the EPS guidance range by about $0.30 per share, or almost 500 basis points. As a result of the $0.30 currency headwind, we expect earnings in a range of $5.80 to $6.10 per diluted share. The distribution of EPS across the quarters will be very similar to 2016.", "Looking more closely at the segments, in the U.S. Domestic segment, we expect average daily volumes to be up 3% to 5%, driving revenue up 5% to 7%. As we increase the pace of investments, additional operating costs will be incurred and temporarily impact margins. Therefore, operating margins will only improve slightly in 2017.", "And the International segment is anticipated to continue its positive momentum, with average daily shipments up 4% to 6%. Product mix will continue to be a headwind for the yield. And, as a result, we see revenue increasing 2% to 4%. Operating profit is expected to be below 2016 by 4% to 8%, due to the currency headwinds of almost $400 million. Adjusting for this headwind, the core growth in bottom-line results remains strong.", "In the Supply Chain & Freight segment, we will show improvements throughout 2017, due to the conditions in Forwarding and the Freight sector getting better. As a result, we anticipate revenue growth of 8% to 10%, with margins slightly below 2016 levels. Operating profit will be down during the first quarter, due to the slower recovery in the Freight Forwarding area. Profits will accelerate throughout the remainder of the year.", "Overall, we anticipate 2017 to be another successful year for UPS. We are investing today to ensure we capitalize on the expanding market opportunities. We have a long history of financial strength. We're using our power to build long-term value through our investment and growth plans to meet these opportunities.", "Thank you for your time today. We look forward to spending more time at the Investor Conference on February 21, providing you additional details on our long-term business strategies and expectations for 2017 and beyond.", "Now, I'll ask the operator to open the line so we can take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask a question on Domestic margins. So, Richard, you just noted that you're expecting margins to improve slightly, I think, in 2017. What are the specific actions you're going to be taking? We're seeing this sort of mix shift happening here. You mentioned price earlier on the call. Is price going to be the primary tool? Is there a way to accelerate that to maybe see a little bit more than slight improvement in 2017? Thank you.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure, Chris. I think the first thing to think about here is that based on this tremendous change in mix, we think it's important to continue to lean in. And so, what you'll see is that we're going to actually quicken the pace of our CapEx, because we think the benefits long-term make sense. So we're going to take some operations penalty, and that's why you see the margin going what it is. But it is two sides to the equation. And in a minute, I'll ask Alan to comment on the revenue side.", "But from a cost side, we continue down the same path we've been on, but with this tremendous opportunity, we feel like we can take the challenge on because the market is expanding and gives UPS an opportunity to continue to grow. And that's why you see in our guidance, that we actually guided higher than our historical norm. And you saw for this quarter, actually the fastest growth of revenue that we've seen in any of the quarters this year. Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, thanks, Rich. Clearly, our integrated model generates superior margins and returns. However, as Richard alluded to, it's more complex to manage when the volume surges or when we see these product mix shifts that we're seeing, unlike any past trends. So the first goal is to ensure that the revenue aligns with the new product mix and the peak value that we're creating for our customers.", "So for 2017, we've already taken some significant action. The 2017 GRI was really targeted to maximize our base rates and profitable growth. And, in addition, there's a few notable items that are targeted specifically at some of these changes we're seeing. First is, we have a new DIM weight divisor for all the U.S. domestic packages greater than one cubic foot. We've changed that from 166 to 139. And then with e-commerce, we're also seeing a lot more of these larger packages. So we've changed our additional handling fee for all packages with lengths over 48 inches versus 60 inches. We did that back mid-year for Ground in 2016. And for Air and SurePost, that's effective for 2017.", "And just one other note on the large packages, we've also raised our over max charge very significantly. So those are a few of the actions that we're taking, but certainly there's going to be additional focus on yield management improvements for peak and year-round to make sure we're aligning our price to our cost to serve and the value that we're creating for our customers, ensuring we're receiving proper returns. Thanks for the question, Chris.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, great. Good morning. If I could just follow up on that a little bit, you keep investing to keep pace with e-commerce, so your outlook is a 0% to 5% EPS growth. You mentioned the 500 basis points impact from currency. I guess the $400 million is a little higher than the prior $300 million target. Is that a structural shift down from your prior EPS long-term growth rate? Does this shift back over time as investments slows? Maybe you can talk a little bit about that structural change.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. I'll start by saying that when we look at guidance, we look at two things. First, we look what's happening inside UPS, and of course we look at the economic conditions. In terms of inside UPS, we're continuing to create operating efficiency through implementation. But what we're really doing is leaning in and saying, we need to do this faster. And so that creates long-term value, because when we change our network, we're changing it for not just our B2C volume, but we're changing it for all of our products, because we run that integrated network.", "So we will see some operating penalties in the short-term as we have temporary buildings, as we do more hub mod a little faster, things like that. But at the same time, economically, we provide a guidance range that's realistic. And so, that's why it's actually \u2013 the guided number was 1% to 6%, (28:52) but you have to add that 500 basis points to it, or $0.30 a share, and you get to something that shows underlying growth actually continuing to be strong.", "And essentially, when you look at \u2013 because you referenced the old guidance numbers \u2013 if you look back in 2014, the forecast for industrial production was different over the last two years. It stayed soft. There was supposed be a recovery mid-2015, and that did not occur. Additionally, you've seen this continued contrast in consumer versus industrial growth. And, of course, the last point is that the pension discount rates and interest rate environment generally have stayed softened really for eight years, and again, there was an expectation back in 2014 that that would start to recover.", "So we'll cover all this in a lot more detail when we meet in a few weeks at the Investor Conference, but we feel like, when you put it all together, the underlying business is performing well. We're preparing it for the future, and that's why we've guided the way we have.", "Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take a online question from Brian Ossenbeck at JPMorgan. And Brian's question is about the investments in Europe, the $2 billion investment that we've laid out. And to the extent that the program is improving time in transits across our International Ground network, when will the benefits really start being realized?", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay, Brian. This is Jim Barber. I'll take that one. I guess I could start with the last question and move back to the first is, when will the benefits be realized? I think they continue to be realized every year we perform our growth model in Europe. Very specifically to the question, a couple of points, is that I like to say that the buildout in Europe is in thirds. We've completed a third, we have a third underway and a third yet to go. I almost liken it to an integration, it just happens to be organic versus inorganic. And the reason I say that is, when we're done, we will have actually modified about a third of our network in Europe.", "Now to one more point, I think would resonate on the question and the discussion about, when will benefits accrue? Earlier in the year, we took a look at the network and decided we needed to speed it up on behalf of consumers in the market. We actually modified 7,000 lanes in 27 country pairs, effectively speeding the network up by a day in every case across intra-Europe.", "The proof point is that, if you look at the growth model in Europe, the first quarter was flat. The second quarter, we grew on the ground at almost 6%, the third quarter almost 8%, and the quarter we just finished, we grew at about 11%. So I think the question about, when will the benefits accrue, I think that's rhetorical. And I think the issue is for us to keep it going. And in 2017, our next steps will be up in the air to continue the expansion. So I appreciate the question.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Domestic margin pressure that you experienced in fourth quarter. Is this primarily a start-up cost issue? And you did describe how you ramped a lot of facilities up, and that was a pretty strong pace. Or is it more of a delivery-point density issue? You talked about the miles driven, that that was pretty efficient, but your stops were up a lot. So I don't know if you can kind of differentiate if it's both or more of one of the other. And then, I don't know if you have any thoughts that you want to provide on the, just where you're at on the hub modernization program? Because you did refer to accelerating that a bit, I think, versus what the prior plan was, so I guess those are the questions. Thank you.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. So, when you look at the operating margin, the biggest impact to the operating margin for the fourth quarter was really driven by the balance of volume. We saw, in fact, a dramatic shift in B2C. And we went back all the way 10 years, and this was the fastest pace of movement from B2B to B2C on a weighted average. So, on one side, it's partly driven by that.", "The other side is what's happening externally, too. And, of course, that means the industrial production is still \u2013 remained soft. In a minute, I'm going to ask Myron talk a little about specifically the operations, but what we're really saying is, by talking about our increased CapEx really this year, we went up over 20% and next year we're going to do it again, it's really about quickening the pace so that we can continue to transform the network, because long-term, that's going to improve the margins. And it's actually going to help or be a tailwind as we come against more volume that has a little less density.", "We are still creating that synthetic density through SurePost redirect, through My Choice and the use of access points. But when you put it all together, this is really about, we're mid-cycle in a process that we laid out a few years ago. And we said it would be about a five-year process to get done. And we are going to quicken a little bit to get it done, because of the results and the value it creates is worthwhile. With that, on hub mod, we're going to talk about that at the Investor Conference in a few weeks, and I'll ask Myron to talk specifically about the Domestic business.", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So, Tom, quickly, we're, as Rich mentioned, mid-process of a multi-year approach to our automation process, but they are giving us 20% to 25% greater productivity. That helps us to improve flexibilities, reduce the handles in our network, which obviously continue to help us reduce or bend the cost curve. So we're about mid-way through the process, with most of the capacity and automation coming online in 2018, 2019 and 2020. But as Rich mentioned, we'll give you more information in a few weeks.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "This is Scott again. Let's just make sure that there's only one question. We're trying to get through as many sell-side analysts as possible, so we'll only select one question moving forward per analyst.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Richard, just maybe can you give us your thinking on how you get comfortable that the Domestic margin has kind of found a floor here, and whether or not you can give us any more detail on how big the OpEx penalty that you pulled forward is for 2017?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay, David, good morning. When we're looking at the operating margin and what we're doing, it really has to do with several different initiatives that we have coming on. We have about 15 or so initiatives this year that we're investing in that are really about the future, both from a capacity standpoint, but also from a capability standpoint. I think it's best if we leave a lot of that discussion for when we meet at the Investor Conference, but I do think the important part is that we think there's two sides to solving this. The one side is continue bending the cost curve, and we've seen that with ORION. And if you think about these different projects we're talking about, they're the same kind of thing; continue to find automation and efficiency through investment of capital.", "At the same time, there's the revenue side and the things that Alan talked about. I think if you also step back for a moment and you look at where we are today versus a few years ago, because there's been references to that, since 2014, our revenue in the U.S. has grown 9%. And since 2014, our profit has grown almost 18%.", "So while we know we're not quite where we wanted to be this quarter, we do know that even though we took on historical numbers from B2C, fastest growth we've seen in 10 years, that the returns, while not where we want them to be, are still very strong. And we are building for the long-term with transforming our network, and this is just one of those steps in the process that we laid out a few years ago.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, so this is David. I'd just like to reinforce what Richard said. Just want to remind everybody, we did have record EPS for the fourth quarter and for the full year. E-commerce brings challenges. It certainly brings great opportunities. We believe we have the right strategy. We feel we're making the right investments. If this quarter told us anything, it told us we've got to quicken the pace and we've already said we're going to do that. And we're going to seize the opportunities that we know can come worldwide from B2C. So we see it as a very good opportunity for our people, and we're going to capitalize on it. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. So wanted to ask about the CapEx guidance, it implies about 6% of revenue on CapEx, which is the highest we've seen in, think, over 10 years. Would you characterize this as kind of a one-time step-up in CapEx, given kind of quickening the pace of capital projects or is this more of a new kind of run rate for CapEx? And maybe just at a higher level, can you just talk about, do you \u2013 you've said in the past that e-commerce was going to be a business that requires lower capital. Do we need to now rethink that, where it's a business that requires higher capital?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure, Scott, and again this is Richard. I think one thing to keep in mind here is our priorities have always been the same, which is first is to reinvest in the business because of the high ROIC being mid-20s or higher. When we look at it, we're not talking about investing in automating the networks because of only e-commerce. As I hopefully have communicated in the past, one of the benefits of everything we invest is that every package gets a benefit, and they get a benefit because we run that single integrated network. And so, we're investing to create automation and the use of technology across the network in major hubs. And that's going to impact both our B2C volume, our B2B, our Next Day Air and our exports and imports out of the U.S.", "That all being said, I think how you should think about the CapEx is for the next several years, we'll be a little higher than we have been, say, the last six or seven years. But it's all about continuing to create value, continuing to grow this company a little bit faster than historical norms. And that's why we also guided on the revenue the way we did. So we'll again talk a little bit more about our CapEx and where we're headed at the Investor Conference, but I think that gives you a pretty good picture of where we're headed.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We'll take an online question. This one, we've had multiple questions on trade. The questions are thoughts around global trade outlook with this new administration; how that's going to impact our business as well as the comments on the TPP and that losing favor in the current administration.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. This is David Abney. The first question came from David Ross [Stifel, Nicolaus]. And you know in spite of the headlines, and there's been quite a few, President Trump is really not against trade agreements. Now, he's made it very clear he wants trade agreements to be fair from a U.S. perspective. And he also has made it clear that versus multilateral agreements, that he's much more focused on bilateral agreements.", "UPS, as a company, we support trade agreements. We support bilateral. We support multilateral. And I can tell you that in every country where the U.S. in the last 10 years has reached a trade agreement, we have seen an actual real increase of packages entering our network going out to these countries, U.S. exports, of a 20% increase. And 20% increase, whether you get the benefit from many bilateral agreements or one multilateral agreement, you can see how that adds up.", "We did get a separate question, and it was concerning TPP and how disappointed are we that the U.S. has withdrawn from TPP negotiations? And obviously, UPS is a big supporter of TPP, and we thought it was a modernized trade agreement for the 21st century. And so, yes, we would like to see multilateral agreements like that get approved. But I can tell you that if you follow the President's strategy, and you do a series of fairly quick bilateral agreements with the major countries that are involved in TPP or that may eventually have been included in TPP, we think you can still get there, maybe not as quickly as you would in this manner, but we are encouraged that the U.S. is going to focus on trade agreements. And we are expecting to see some progress in a fairly short period of time. So thank you for the question.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. David, you mentioned you're a fan of corporate tax reform. And I was hoping to get your thoughts on just the House GOP tax plan as it's written and then perhaps some comments on the details of the repatriation of cash held overseas, CapEx expensing, interest, the loss of deductibility; just how you think that would impact UPS as a company. And then also the border-adjusted provision, obviously, tied to that for the time being, how would that affect your customers if that were to be implemented? Thank you.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Brian, we're going to take the first part of that question, just the tax reform.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for that part of the question, Brian. And I may be able to cover a little part in answering this one, too. But first, you've got to realize that we have a high tax rate. It's about 35%. And so when we hear about comprehensive tax reform, we get pretty excited pretty quickly. There's no doubt about that. And we look for a competitive tax rate. We also look for the territorial provision that we can bring earnings back.", "When you get to the House blueprint, while we do appreciate the tax rate, we do share some concerns that many of our customers have about the potential impact of the border adjustment tax. And one of the first questions is we're trying to find out just exactly how that's going to work. And it's a little bit early. We don't have all the answers yet. So we're certainly pursuing those answers.", "And the second part of this, you have to know how it's going to work to see if it's really going to affect trade coming into the U.S. So from the blueprint, we are certainly excited about a lower rate, but we think there's a lot of concerns and a lot of questions about the border adjustment tax, and we need answers before we could go much further there. So thank you for the question.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. So, David, I realize you are at record earnings levels for the company, but I think if we look from 2014 through your guidance in 2017, we've only hit the long-term guidance one out of those four years. So when you talk about bending the cost curve going forward, we've heard about these technology investments for a long time now, package flow technology going back a while. We've heard about ORION for a number of years. I know you guys have implemented that; synthetic density, automated hubs. We can go on with the Coyote acquisition, but what is it about the business where you've just seen the degradation in margins for the past decade? And why is it that we think going forward, this acceleration investment is going to help profitability in the business?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Well, I'm actually going to take the question, Brandon. This is Richard. And I think the first thing you have to look at is, again, if you go back to 2014 and our long-term guidance, we expected to see growth in industrial production in 2015 and 2016. And really for the last year and a half, last year and three-quarters, you've seen that go negative. That has a big impact on growth rate of the B2B business. And earlier, I talked about, we looked at both the internal and the external, and we try to give you a range of realistic goals based on economic assumptions, and they've come in much differently.", "The other thing that plays a large part in where we sit is the discount rate is something like 100 basis points different. And you saw what that did to mark-to-market. That impacts expense, too. But separating all the external, what's happening inside the business is you're seeing this massive trend of B2C going much faster.", "We talked about in 2014, that it would be a five year process to get our hubs all automated. And so we're mid-process in it. And what we're really saying is for 2017, 2018, we're going to go a little faster than what we originally said because the value of that is so great, not only for the B2C, but for all of the business in Ground and our Next Day Air, et cetera.", "So one of the reasons we're coming together in a few weeks is really to talk about where we see the business today, what the economics numbers kind of show externally and how we see we're going to continue to grow this business. Because at the end of the day, one of the parts that's very important to us is that we do spur growth, and that's why you see us guide on revenue above our historical norm.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "And this is David. Just like to wrap up that question and still want to remind that we have the best margins in the industry, and there was a little bit of reference to, over the past couple of years. Let me just give you a quick comparison, just to keep everything relative. And I'll compare fourth quarter 2016 to fourth quarter 2014. Our operating profit's up over $200 million and 17.7%.", "We do have a very interesting opportunity when it comes to B2C. And it is not progressing in a linear fashion. There will be times that it doesn't speed up quite as much, and then there'll be times that it'll shoot forward, like it did now. But under no circumstances should anybody doubt whether we have the strategies or making the right investments. ORION, that you do hear us talk a lot about, we had 5% volume growth, and the number of miles that we traveled was an additional percentage-wise, Richard?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "0.3%", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "0.3%. So you just look at that. And if we had not made the investments in ORION, you just normally expect that you're going to grow volume by 5%; you're going grow stops by 4.7%; that you'd grow miles accordingly. And we were able to reduce that to 0.3 of a mile.", "These automated hubs have given us 20%, 25% efficiency. And so, the end of the day, it is not that we need to change our strategies, we need to quit making investments. The end of the day is, we've got to speed and go forward. We have to stay up with the market. The market is clearly moving greater B2C. That's the focus that you will see UPS from both an innovation, from a cost, and from working with our customers to make sure that we get paid for the cost to serve their packages.", "Thanks for the question, and let's move on to the next one, please.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. Swinging into International, could you discuss your outlook for package yield international, excluding ForEx, and elaborate on some of the key drivers going forward; looks like that's one of the stronger areas? Thanks.", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "This is Jim. So I think Richard kind of got close to that in the beginning. I think when you clean it up for FX, we're going to be sitting about 18%, and that certainly is a margin we're comfortable with. If you look at going forward, I've talked previously, a few minutes ago, about Europe. No question that that is paying dividends for us.", "I think, last quarter, we talked about our 747-800s. We touched on the fact that Asia grew almost 20%, to right at 20% for us in the fourth quarter; hence, leaning into the aircraft that'll start to come online in October of this year, which will pay dividends for us in peak of 2017. We're expanding in 21 cities in China. In those cities specifically, the growth rates are truly 50%, where we're putting in a different model to go to market in China, so we really feel good about Asia.", "And then I think the other thing that I would mention that's kind of gone quietly through International is, this year, last two years, we purposely put in Express expansion into the world. We kind of took a look at it internally. David pushed us to look at growth a little bit differently in 2015, actually. What that meant is that so far, in 2016, we've added Express to 60,000 more ZIP Codes in the world, in 52 different countries. We put 26 new countries on early a.m. at the same time, and proof point, just like the European growth model, our worldwide Express growth for the year 2016, which we will continue to move into 2017, has gone from flat to 4.5% growth to 8%, to now almost 11% growth in the export \u2013 in the International products, so we feel good about it, and all these things are coming together to get what you've seen in the past and will continue in the future. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hi. Good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for getting our question in. So Richard, you mentioned a couple times that one of the two big headwinds outside of your control since 2014 has been the 100 basis point pension discount rate decline. So we just wanted to clarify going forward, how much pension expense headwind is included in the 2017 guidance?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure, Danny. I think, when you look at pension expense in 2017, we look at it in two buckets. We look at the multi-employer, and that will grow the same as volume, and so we don't really see any change to that. For the UPS-sponsored plans, it actually will be relatively flat, and it's really driven by the actions we took due to the increasing PBGC premiums and the pre-funding, as well as coming up against headwinds from the discount rate. So the important point here is that we actively manage the pension environment. And we're doing the right thing for UPS and for the investors, but essentially the expense for UPS-sponsored plans will be flat in 2017.", "Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning. Thank you for the time. Just following up on your comments earlier about global trade and the new administration, I was just curious if you could maybe talk to the flexibility that you think is in the network to be able to add capacity in certain geographies or reduce capacity in others, given what we're seeing as could be fairly dynamic trade policy coming out of Washington, and the potential tax policy changes. How do we think about your ability to flex up and flex down your cost structure to match what could be changing freight flows?", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. This is David. The biggest advantage of our network is our ability to flex up and down. And if that means that trade happens more in one area versus the other, then we obviously can move our assets, and we can make those adjustments. We still, though, we don't believe that the world is falling off the cliff. We think that there will be trade agreements. We think that global trade is still going to continue to grow, and we're prepared to make those adjustments. And if something does happen where trade drops in particular areas of the world, then we will make those adjustments, too. If it means that we have to remove some of our planes from these areas temporarily or if we have to move resources, we will certainly do that. So we're prepared either way, but we're going to work very hard to make sure that everyone understands the importance of competing in the 21st century and that is through trade, which drives jobs, and it also drives opportunities for Americans. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yeah, thank you. So can you refresh us on your current rolling strategy of hedging FX forward a month at a time and how far you are into implementing it? Or we said it another way, just trying to get a sense if you're going to feel the impact of the late 2016 dollar strength this year in that $400 million that you guided, or if this is a more gradual headwind that comes on in 2018, 2019?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. This is Richard, obviously, and what I wanted to make sure that I cover on this, the headwind is for the year 2017. And what's actually going to happen over time is we'll see less of this because we're moving from a multi-year hedge, where extreme volatility that came out in 2014 and 2015 saw a dramatic drop. So therefore, we were kind of exposed because it went to one to $1.35 down to $1.11. Earlier last year, we started guiding around our dollar cost averaging, and so it's fully implemented in 2018, but we're fully covered in 2017 as well.", "And what we do is we buy $1.36 of our coverage each month. And so what that does is takes the volatility out of the currency. And that's how you hedge currencies. So what that means is your year-over-year comp won't have as much exposure because it's only the head and the tail that are different for the comparison periods.", "That being said, the unhedged currencies have exposure and that's because there's hundreds of currencies and it's all about how the currency reacts against the dollar. We haven't seen the kind of reaction that we saw really in the last six weeks to eight weeks of 2016 historically, where almost every major currency in the world went a different way than the dollar. And that's why we had to guide up that the expected impact for 2017 is around $400 million, but as it occurs through the year, we'll have to continue to give you information.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Aegis Capital. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.", "Thank you very much for letting me ask my question. You're about 1.2 times debt to EBITDA. You've explained why you're accelerating capital investment and reducing the amount of cash allocated to share repurchase. Since this level of CapEx is going to be at an elevated spend strategically for the next few years, should we expect less cash funneled towards share repurchase or might you be in a position to use some of the balance sheet to maintain the level of share repurchase for the next couple of years?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So again, this is Richard, and I think the most important thing is to remember that our priorities haven't changed. We still think investing in the business, making dividends a priority is important. But having the flexibility based on opportunistic-type things makes a lot of sense, we feel like. At the same time, it does appear we're entering a very favorable cycle for pension accounting, and so that may drive us to do things differently.", "We'll kind of put all this together and talk a little bit about that when we're together at the Investor Conference, but we think it's important that we're fortunate because we can balance the needs of the business and still have a strong total return to our shareholders. But we're always evaluating ways to accelerate and create value. And again, we'll plan to talk a little bit more about that at the Investor Conference.", "Operator", "That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Childress and panel for any closing remarks they may have.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. We appreciate you joining us today. I'd like to allow David closing comments, if I would, please.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, so I'd like to thank everyone for being on the call. And we'd like to just finish up that we're very excited about the opportunities, the opportunities that we're going to have in e-commerce, but the opportunities \u2013 we didn't talk about this as much \u2013 in emerging markets, and with what Jim and his group is doing in our International business. And then, last is the focus on technology and making sure that we continue to implement technology that's going to make us more efficient. It's going to make us more flexible, and it's going to provide more value to our customers. So, again, thanks for being on the call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our UPS Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Teleconference Call.

These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K.

Now we'll turn the call over to David.", "David Abney ", "Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings review. We will talk in a few moments about the CFO transition announced this morning, but first, we are going to review the quarter. ", "I am pleased to report UPS produced solid performance across all the segments. Earnings per share increased more than 14% led by International. This segment continues to demonstrate positive momentum as our unmatched integrated network generates high returns and significant value for customers around the world.", "The US Domestic segment performed as planned. Our actions on revenue management and pricing drove revenue per piece higher during the first quarter. The pace of volume moderated as we chose to forego some lower yielding opportunities. And in the Supply Chain and Freight segment, revenue and operating profit improved over last year as all three business units made progress. ", "The first quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that we are on track with our core business initiatives, both for the remainder of 2015 and for our long-term financial targets. Last year, at the Investor Conference, we outlined five key investment areas. These include improvements in capacity, efficiency and our strategies for growth markets. ", "In addition, we\u2019ve detailed our industry-specific focus and the One UPS initiative. We are moving forward in all five areas. In terms of greater efficiency, we improved productivity and operating leverage during the quarter. Investments in hub automation and route optimization projects are on schedule. ", "In fact, we expect the accelerated deployment of ORION will reduce a 100 million miles annually once fully implemented. We are on plan to complete 70% of driver routes by the end of this year. To support the core business initiative of expanding industry-specific solutions, UPS enhanced two services to assist healthcare customers. ", "We introduced our new Temperature True Packaging service which includes expert consultation and exclusive packaging options. These shipping containers are pre-qualified for use in our network and designed to fit our customers\u2019 budget and risk requirements. ", "Next was the expansion of our international special commodities program to 20 new destination countries. This allows UPS customers to ship biologic samples and specimens to more than 50 nations. These solutions will provide growth opportunities with new and existing healthcare clients. ", "Our third initiative is capitalizing on growth markets. As demonstrated by our International segment, especially the strong growth that we continue to produce in Europe. The multi-year investments we\u2019ve made there have positioned UPS to extend our ten plus years of near double-digit growth rates for the region. ", "Another great example of a growth opportunity for UPS is the online retail. To strengthen our position as the e-commerce shipper of choice, we are expanding the access point network, our unique network of retail locations that both improves the consumers\u2019 experience and provides better stop economics. ", "In January, we increased the US footprint to include the more than 4400 UPS store locations. In May, we will add non-UPS store locations in the Boston, San Francisco and Washington DC metro markets. These expansions will bring the total access point locations to more than 20,000 by the year end. This unique channel is a key component of our global B2C strategy. ", "As I reviewed at the Investor Conference, combining the many capabilities of UPS to meet customers\u2019 supply chain needs is the foundation of our One UPS strategy. To increase awareness, we began a campaign to highlight the breadth of services that differentiates UPS in the marketplace. ", "The tagline says it all. We are UPS, and to customers, we are united problem solvers. This play on our name and the entire campaign invites shippers to experience the can do, customer-centric, problem-solving culture of UPS. ", "The goal is, both the new customer acquisition and deeper collaboration with existing shippers. These five investment areas are key to achieving our financial targets. ", "I want to reinforce that UPS is intensely focused on creating and enhancing long-term shareowner value. This will be achieved by providing differentiated solutions delivered by highly skilled UPS. ", "Our belief in both the UPS business model and the execution of our strategy was conveyed by the recent 9% dividend increase. We have a 46 year history of providing UPS investors an increasing or stable dividend. When combined with share repurchases, we expect total returns to shareholders to exceed 100% of our net income again this year. ", "This quarter clearly affirms that we are moving in the right direction and on track to achieve our financial objectives. ", "Now, Kurt will take you through the details. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, thanks, David and good morning. The first quarter results show good progress across all segments. The US performed well and is successfully implementing a disciplined pricing strategy. International continues to produce strong momentum with a balance of growth, pricing and operating performance, and Supply Chain and Freight achieved solid results considering the turbulence created by the port disruption. ", "As David mentioned, UPS earnings per share improved more than 14% over last year. Digging into the numbers, the impact of currency and fuel price changes have made comparisons to last year complex. But we\u2019ll try to make it clear as we move through the segment results. ", "Let me begin with the US Domestic segment, which reported revenue gains of 3.8% as a result of volume growth and improved pricing. Average Daily Package volume increased 2.4% driven by Deferred Air growth of more than 12% and UPS SurePost gains of 7%. ", "Shipment growth rates were a little bit slower as the company chose not to pursue some lower yielding contract renewals. During the quarter, we saw balanced growth in both B2B and B2C shipments. Revenue per package increased 1.3% as base rate improvements overcame about a 200 basis point reduction in fuel surcharges. Ground yield was up 3.1%, primarily due to the dim weight change and other revenue management actions. ", "Operating profit grew 11% to more than $1 billion. Margin expanded by 70 basis points supported by productivity improvements. Direct labor hours grew at a slower pace than volume. ", "Now for the International segment, which continues to make substantial gains around the world, revenue on a currency-adjusted basis increased 2.4% over last year. International operating profit was up 14% to $498 million. ", "Margin expanded 280 basis points to 16.8%. Volume growth, pricing initiatives and the benefit from the lag in fuel surcharges, all contributed to margin expansion. In addition, our currency hedging strategy also aided results. ", "Daily shipments were 4.6% higher led by export products up 6.7%. This gain was driven by impressive growth in Europe, up more than 9% and we expect strong volume growth there to continue. Base rates improved across all regions and products, although they were masked by currency and changes in product mix and about a 300 basis point impact from lower fuel surcharges. ", "Mix shift changes continued as trans-border volume grew faster than intercontinental shipments, and deferred products continued to outpace express products.

Excluding the impact of currency, revenue increased by 4.2%. ", "Operating profit increased to $151 million and margin was 6.9%.

Please go ahead.", "David Vernon", "Thanks for taking the question and congratulations to both Kurt and Richard. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, David. ", "David Vernon", "Little bit about pricing, can you talk about the progress and results that you guys have seen and implementing dim weight in the Domestic segment and provide any kind of additional insight into customer feedback on peak pricing initiatives that were discussed last call?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Sure, the \u2013 clearly, you can see on our reported yields that even with the headwinds of fairly substantial fuel surcharges, we showed substantial gain. So, the dim weight is one piece of that. Alan, maybe you could talk a little more about the revenue management more ahead. ", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, Kurt. Pricing has been a real positive story. We are certainly proud of our sales and marketing team discipline and the value selling. As you can see, we were 200 basis points better than last year\u2019s year-over-year growth rate with even a much larger fuel drag. So the impact came at the high-end of our expectation range and certainly the dim weight along with other revenue management practices contributed to that. ", "Also on the call, previously, Kurt\u2019s and I believe David\u2019s comments, they talked about us not renewing some lower yield in customers. Switching to peak real quickly, we\u2019ve got a comprehensive strategy in place that\u2019s already begun to increase the revenue from customers that urge during the peak season and then also drive additional operating expenses. ", "Price increases again it can be generally applied to the residential products and other high cost areas, but they will vary by customer and those revenue initiatives are already built into the guidance. ", "David Vernon", "Thanks, just as a clarification, as far as the number of customers that are paying a dim weight, are there a large \u2013 is there a large percentage of shippers that maybe gotten a waiver and that\u2019s going to be out there in the future? Or can you give us a sense for kind of what percentage of customers actually took that dim weight charge in this year? ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, David, we\u2019ll save that for the next questioner. Let\u2019s move on. ", "David Vernon", "All right, thanks. ", "Operator", "The next question will come from Mr. Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Tom Wadewitz ", "Yes, thank you and, Kurt, congratulations to you. I\u2019ve worked with you for a long time, remember back when you are Head of IR and it\u2019s really been a pleasure working with you over the years. So, congratulations on the retirement and Richard, congratulations to you as well. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "All right. ", "Tom Wadewitz ", "Let\u2019s see. So, I think, I want to ask a little bit more on the pricing, the strategy, how much is this change in terms of the yield management that you would expect affecting going forward? Are we going to hear more about yield management and turning away business and perhaps even acceleration in pricing from what we\u2019ve seen in first quarter? Or is this more of a one-off where it was a particular piece of business that was kind of a one-time thing? ", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, I think, we are pursuing a consistent revenue management strategy. We have talked last year that following peak season, we were going to migrate and to being more price disciplined. And so, this is not a one-time issue. It\u2019s just a continuation of our strategy. ", "David Abney", "Our revenue management initiatives certainly are gaining traction. We expect that to continue, but we have to remember, this is a multi-pronged strategy. I mean, yes we are working on pricing initiatives and especially along peak season lines, but we are also focusing on creating unique solutions for our customers that brings additional value. ", "And then of course, focusing on operating efficiencies that would give us the results we want to. So, it\u2019s a multi-prong strategy and it\u2019s something that will be throughout the year.

Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter ", "Great, thank you and good morning and I\u2019ll let go that, congrats Kurt, it\u2019s been great working with you for almost 15 years and welcome to Richard. If we could just jump over to International a bit, you\u2019ve posted a increase in profitability up about 280 basis points on the margin. ", "Can you talk \u2013 you talked a lot about the cost, David on the Domestic side, and what you\u2019ve put in place. But a big upside, I think surprise on the International side. Can you kind of walk us through where \u2013 what cost kind of you focused on there or was it more of the volume side or was it the cost side that enabled that increase? ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well I think, you\u2019ll - I think it\u2019s a blend of all of those, but Jim, why don\u2019t you take us through the quarter? ", "Jim Barber", "Sure, I would appreciate the question. I think it is a blend. I think if you start in Europe, you\u2019ve heard us talk for a couple of quarters about the growth there and some of the challenges we had and the Group has done a great job over the last couple of quarters to put that into the network and you also heard us discuss the expansion of the network in Europe in investment, that\u2019s starting to payoff as well and some of the operating efficiencies and I think the other big one for us in the quarter is out in Asia. ", "Even with some of the slower growth, I think the team has done a very good job to cut the network and balance what\u2019s going into the network and I would say, those are the two biggest drivers especially in the Inter-Asia network and the European network as well to drive the numbers this quarter.

Please go ahead.", "Kevin Sterling ", "Thank you and, Kurt, let me say my congratulations as well on your pending retirement. I\u2019ve enjoyed working with you over the years and best of luck to you. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks. ", "Kevin Sterling ", "Maybe, can you guys talk a little bit about some of the trends you are seeing in April? Particularly, on the International side and in LTL, are you still seeing some benefit from the West Coast Port diversions and congestions? ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I think a lot of that\u2019s cleared up. I don\u2019t know, Myron, any particular trends on the LTL side do you think are notable?", "A \u2013 Myron Gray", "On the volume. We are seeing the same thing happened in April that we saw in our first quarter with stable improvements we expect that will have 3% to 3.5% growth and freight market moving forward. So no particular issues there. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, barring a little labor disruption on the ports, of course, given the latest guidelines, yes.", "Kevin Sterling ", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Art Hatfield", "Hey, thank you. Me likewise, Kurt, congrats and it\u2019s been great working with you. Glad that you finally decided that you had enough of us. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "No. And it was a full dose. ", "Art Hatfield", "I am sure. Going back to the comment on your pricing strategy, real quick and being more disciplined, can you talk a little bit about what you see in customer actions that when you decide to walk away? ", "I mean, what\u2019s your kind of history with that? Do you see customers coming back to you after a short period of time when you do something like this asking you to come back as they miss the service? And really are they ultimately going to see higher pricing in the long run and why would they allow you to walk away from them at this point in time? ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 certainly, pricing decisions are complex and it depends a lot on the relationship and the nature of the volume that\u2019s being entered to it. But, Alan, if you could talk a little more about our approach? ", "Alan Gershenhorn", "It really all comes down to, I think what David talked about the balance as well as the value that we are creating for the customers. So, we are very focused on creating value for the specific industries that we are targeting and yes, in some cases, we do see those customers come back. But I just want to reiterate that we are firm in our strategy to further align the revenue with the cost throughout the year including peak season. ", "David Abney", "You know, and I think, I\u2019d probably word it just a little bit different than maybe on the question, as far as walking away, I think it\u2019s more that we do choose sometimes not to pursue some of these lower yielding contract renewals. But we are constantly working with our customers on how we can add value and how we can optimize our network for them. So it\u2019s not like we just walk away. We try to give options and we try to show the value. There are some cases that we choose not to pursue. ", "Art Hatfield", "Right. Thanks for your time this morning. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Bill Greene ", "Yes, hi there, good morning. Kurt, congrats again. Wish you all the best. Richard, congrats, by my condolences. So, I wanted to ask a little bit more of a broader question. Of course, we\u2019ve seen FedEx take action in Europe and they will spend sometime absorbing TNT now integrating it. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the broad global landscape now after that change? ", "Obviously, in the interim, you will try to win I am sure some share in Europe. But, does this make other aspects of the world, other areas of the world more attractive? Should we think more about growth in Asia given the changing playing field in Europe? Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving? Thank you. ", "David Abney", "Certainly, I can, first, I\u2019ll just remind everyone that the FedEx, TNT deal that is complex deal and we expect that regulatory agencies will be as stringent on this deal as they have been on previous deals. Then when you talk about opportunities in Asia. Obviously, Asia and emerging markets were always pursuing those opportunities. ", "Let\u2019s don\u2019t forget the fact that that we have experienced just great returns from our Europe markets and we certainly don\u2019t expect that to change. Over the last ten years, our Europe export average daily volume has more than doubled and we\u2019ve previously announced a five year capital deployment plan that\u2019s approaching about $2 billion. So, we are adding capacity. We are expanding our capabilities. We have a real good business in Europe and we expect it to continue to grow and we are as excited as we have been at any time about Europe. ", "Bill Greene ", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Ross Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Ross ", "Yes, good morning gentlemen. Just to follow-up on the question regarding Europe. The exports are certainly strong driven by the weak euro, but domestic Europe was also up year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about the overall European market, what you see in terms of the European economy right now and going forward? ", "David Abney", "Jim? ", "Jim Barber", "Sure, David, the \u2013 I guess, I\u2019ll just hit on trade flows real quickly. The kind of the balance of the network certainly at this point with the strength of the dollar, we are seeing a move of imports to exports. Europe is a big piece of that. We kind of right now after the first quarter have a gap of about 6% between growth of imports and exports. We\u2019ll balance that. ", "We have to balance the network. We\u2019ll look at how we rate export and import rates across the world, but that\u2019s just part of the normal running of the business. The domestic in Europe, specifically, that just is a continuation of the investments over the last decade as David referenced. We continue to do that and invest in some of those. The acquisitions we\u2019ve made over the previous years help us grow. So, the solutions that are in place will are paying off and they will continue to pay off going forward. ", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben Hartford ", "Hi, good morning guys. Jim, I guess, I am interested in the comment that you had made of a better balance in Asia and I am curious about your perspective as it relates to outbound Asian Air Freight post-Chinese New Year and as we look into 2Q and 3Q with the US West Coast situation presumably normalizing, do you expect further cuts or would the next step be to add incremental pet capacity in that trans-stack lane and just outbound Asia generally, as we look into 2013 there has been \u2013 2015, there has been a lot of debate about a demand to outbound China here year-to-date. I am interested in your perspective there.", "Kurt Kuehn", "So, if I look at April, compared to the first quarter, it continues on and remember in the Freight segment, we are kind of in that transition we have a very targeted growth plan. You can see that in some of the numbers coming through. So you will see lower growth, more targeting of the freight that\u2019s in the network. We\u2019ll continue that. ", "The West Coast Port stoppage in the first quarter gave us some lift, that\u2019s mitigating as we speak. But we have to balance that network obviously with the small package network. Chinese New Year, we had a really good new year this year. We had some great alignment of the network to the volume. ", "That will continue and so it\u2019s just a continuation in our minds of balancing the right network with the right volume at the right levels going forward and I think the first quarter was a success and we see the same things starting off the second quarter. ", "Ben Hartford ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Prashant Rao", "Good morning, this is Prashant Rao in for Chris and congrats to Kurt and to Richard. My question is really on the volume side on Domestic. I was wondering if there is anything \u2013 how much of the volume changes are to be attributed to maybe some seasonal patterns, weather and seasonality a play, any other factors you\u2019d like to call out, maybe in terms of what we are seeing on the Domestic side in terms of volume. Clearly, yields and revenue management are fantastic, but just wanted to kind of get thoughts around the volume side there? ", "David Abney", "Yes, Alan, if you could?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, so, yes, we are actually encouraged by the progress we are making in balancing the volume growth and the yield. We did actually see a dip in the average daily volume in February that aligned with some of the bad weather in the Northeast and other areas of the country. And also some of those pricing decisions not to renew the low yield agreements. ", "Prashant Rao", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger ", "Thanks. Good morning and congratulations Richard, and Kurt. Just following up on that last question, in the first quarter, it sounds like the B2C and B2B were both strong. Could you add a little bit on each please? Thanks. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Alan, go on ahead. ", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, so, for the first time in a very, very long time, our B2B growth was actually a bit stronger than our B2C and as you know, our deferred volumes were also strong and the SurePost while it\u2019s still strong, certainly, year-over-year slowing down as that product becomes more mature. Just keep in mind that this is just a one quarter data and we are still expecting about 3% growth for the year. ", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Kelly Dougherty ", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. And so I just want to follow-up on that last one if we can talk about the B2B versus B2C growth. And wonder how you think about, maybe some UPS-specific initiatives, because some of the macro data that's been out recently has been underwhelming from an industrial production or manufacturing perspective. So thinking about how that factors into maybe what you are expecting earlier this year?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, so, a couple of things. We are very focused on industry-specific solutions that we are building for the hi-tech, the healthcare, the automotive industrial, manufacturers that\u2019s out there. So that we can win more and win faster in those specific areas. ", "Certainly, e-commerce though is also driving a significant amount of our B2B growth through returns as well as manufacturers that ship B2B going more into the e-commerce realm. So, it\u2019s really a mix there. So we are pretty excited about the fact that e-commerce is beginning to generate some significant B2B business.", "Kelly Dougherty ", "Is there any way to separate out, your - I know great that that B2B is growing faster than the B2C at this point. Is there any way to separate out kind of traditional B2B versus what retail might be driving?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Kelly, it is becoming pretty blurred these days. So we are \u2013 at this point, we are really not adding anything to that. ", "Kelly Dougherty ", "Okay, thanks Kurt and congratulations. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Tom Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Tom Kim ", "Thanks very much. I wanted to ask with regard to trading down on International, I mean it was a very impressive performance last quarter and I am wondering to what extent there is actually further opportunities just depending on how trading down may be shifting? Thanks.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, those trends have been pretty consistent. We have seen our standard and deferred products grow faster than our premium express products for a number of years. So, with our aligned network, it\u2019s not a big deal. One thing though that I guess, I do want to highlight, if you look at the yields that there was certainly some impact from the shift of products, but the biggest issue on yields by far is the currency impact. ", "And so, it is \u2013 we do have on Page 3, the schedule of revenue per piece that we\u2019ve always had there. But with Rich coming in as our Treasurer, he decided to give a little gift to you guys and we actually created a new schedule on Page 3 there that shows total company revenue-adjusted for currencies. So, Rich, maybe you could talk a little bit about currencies.", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. We use hedges to minimize the volatility of currency and now the business to concentrate on the fundamentals of growing the company. Our current hedge strategy is protected through the end of 2016 for all the major currencies that we operate in. ", "There are some non-hedged currencies that we saw larger shifts than we have seen historically and that\u2019s because the dollar strengthened so much during this first quarter of 2015. Our strategy is to use a color approach and it really is there to make sure that we are protecting the currency while the business continues to grow. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "So, that\u2019s really been the biggest issue on reported revenues. The trade-down is a small piece of it, but, anyway, we thought being transparent on just what is happening with currency was an important element there and we are fortunate to have locked in a couple of years worth coverage on the euro and the pound that\u2019s certainly helping to keep the financial results solid for the foreseeable future.", "Tom Kim ", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Robert Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Robert Salmon ", "Okay, thanks, and Kurt, and Richard, my congrats to both of you guys as well. If I could kind of turn it back the discussion back to the dimensional pricing, can you give us a sense of how much of the full impact that you guys realized in the first quarter? And how we should be thinking about that stepping up as we look out to 2016 and 2017 for some of the longer term contracts that you have?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I think one way to look at it, and I\u2019ll let Alan talk a little bit about the contracts, but certainly the initial impact of dim weight has been primarily on the revenue side. But ultimately, we are working with a large number of customers to adjust their packaging, that\u2019s the real intent to this. And so, if anything we have said, the revenue impact will moderate a little over time and the economic benefit of less air in our feeders will come through. ", "So, we did see a big benefit in the first quarter and as we work with customers to reduce their costs then that will migrate. And then certainly with some long-term contracts there are some other ramifications. ", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, I mean, I think it\u2019s a combination of both. So you\u2019ve got our customers that we are working with to get smarter on their packaging which obviously helps us add on the side, but we\u2019ll take the revenue down a bit and then we\u2019ve got some longer term contracts that we\u2019ll be able to capture a bit more the dim weight opportunity going forward. ", "What we are looking at this year is that, we already stated that we are at the high-end of the 2% to 3% base rate that we look for and our expectation is that that\u2019s going to continue through the year. ", "Robert Salmon ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski ", "Well, good morning everyone and Kurt, as well, congratulations, just make sure you watch out for Andy Dolny on the golf course when you're back out there.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Right, he is dangerous. ", "Brandon Oglenski ", "I\u2019ve heard. I can't let you off that easy, so I do want to ask a question on Domestic margins and I guess it's two parts, I hope I'm not cheating on the one question rule here. But, can you first quantify the fuel impacts on margins for us if possible? ", "But then, can we walk through the puts and takes here, because obviously you have a pretty strong pricing outlook, but what are the cost additions of the capacity initiatives that we have again, and I know you - I think you have $180 million of pension headwind. Should we still be thinking that margins domestically are going to be roughly flat with last year or even slightly up, which I think was the prior guidance?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I\u2019ll let you cheat. It\u2019s because the final farewell question here. And I\u2019ll let margin \u2013 I\u2019ll have Myron \u2013 excuse me \u2013 talk about the margin enhancement activities. In general, just to highlight the impact of fuel a little bit, for the International business, there was a benefit of fuel of about $30 million or so. In general, coverage for fuel and International was not a 100%, so as fuel dropped we got a benefit although the lag accounted for a lot of that. On the Domestic side, actually, fuel was relatively neutral for us in the quarter. ", "Traditionally, there is a benefit from the lag as it drops, but with fuel dropping frankly to unexpected levels, our coverage ratio is at the very low end of the fuel curve were not complete and that in effect, offset the lag. We did tweak the curves a little bit in February and so that will be relatively neutral going forward. But, we did not get a material benefit on fuel in the first quarter. So, Myron, maybe you talk a little bit about the margin enhancing activities we are working on. ", "Myron Gray", "Yes, Brandon, keep in mind that, US Domestic really is a year-over-year comp story as we also have a drag of almost $200 million in pension expense that I want to bring to your attention. In addition to that, as David Abney earlier alluded to, we have made progress operationally on several fronts. We\u2019ve continued to deploy operational technologies. We\u2019ve tightened up our operations from a dispatch perspective and we continue to add capacity in selected markets as well as our hub marked projects. ", "David Abney", "The first quarter just really affirms that we are moving in the right direction. And that we are on track for our financial objectives and we really had solid performance across all three of the segments. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Kauffman ", "Thank you very much and Kurt, best of luck and Richard, really looking forward to working with you. Although I do reflect on the fact that Kurt, you've been promoted a number of times, now you are retiring and I am in the same job. All right. So here is my question, the International growth you talked about 2% to 3% ex-currency, but in the current quarter, you did 2.4% ex-currency. ", "And as I look around the world, I am looking at get some big markets for you like Europe that seem to be gaining in momentum. So, can you tell us through your eyes what's going on and how the levers are moving globally? And are there any aspects of the global environment that you were downgrading to stay at this \u2013 at level in terms of your forecast for the year?", "David Abney", "All right, from a macro point of view and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim. But the \u2013 International growth is not expected to be quite as strong as previous estimates. It\u2019s not 2.8% GDP growth versus 3.0%. So the outlook is really mixed at the regional level. In Europe, the growth is estimated to be 1.9%. ", "So, previously forecasted at 1.7% and that\u2019s really driven by Germany, and one key point here I think is, for the year, the real UPS \u2013 excuse \u2013 EU real exports are forecasted to grow at 4.8% this year in 2015. So, Jim, turn it over to you to talk about the specifics.", "Jim Barber", "Yes, I would add probably three quick points to that. One, and then we already touched on one, one is kind of the balance of trade here. And how that plays out relative to some of the currencies moving in the world. I think, you also have fuel in here that is one of those wild cards that we are not sure how that\u2019s going to work We also have to look at a little bit of China slowing in this discussion. ", "We can\u2019t forget that at any time. And I think the last part is that, as we\u2019ve gone through this, we have purposely said that we are going to slow some of the growth until our investments catch-up with it and then we\u2019ll fire the engine up faster again. ", "So this is kind of one of those purposed slowing to let the investments catch-up, reinvigorate it and keep moving forward. So, we are going to kind of dip it down a little bit from a revenue or a volume revenue. But that will be very targeted in our revenue management activities to do that. So that\u2019s our plan. ", "Jeff Kauffman ", "Well, thank you very much. That\u2019s my one. ", "David Abney", "Great.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group ", "Hey, thanks. Morning guys. So, first, Kurt, when you were giving the fuel impacts, I didn't hear you give one for Freight, if you can give that. And then just my bigger question is on Europe and you talked about you've had this kind of sustained track record of growing double-digits and wondering given the FedEx, TNT deal how you think that plays out and whether or not you think that will accelerate in the near-term? And do you think that once the deal closes, do you think you'll be able to sustain double-digit growth in Europe?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I am not sure how many questions that was Scott. But we\u2019ll humor you a little bit. Certainly, fuel was a significant drag on reported revenues and Freight, almost 500 basis points. The P&L impact was modest, but not significant, because of the dramatic change in coverage ratios once again as we move down to those levels. David? ", "David Abney", "We feel real good about Europe this year and we do have a great track record. We are investing heavily to expand our business. But there is a little bit of transition going on with some of the players in the market and we are certainly going to emphasize our message that we have a fantastic service offering. We meet our customers\u2019 needs there and we are going to continue to invest and grow in this important part of our business.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison Landry ", "Thanks, good morning. ", "David Abney", "Morning.", "Allison Landry ", "In terms of the hub modernization, how many of the 30 major US sorting facilities are now automated? And given our expectations for continued strength in e-commerce, whether it's B2C or B2B, do you see any need to further accelerate investments in the network? And within that context, should we read anything into their cash builds during Q1?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I\u2019ll start with the last piece of that once again. No, the cash build in Q1 is more just typical seasonal from Q4 where we have a lot of receivables coming at the end of the year. For Q1, where our CapEx is usually low that we do see the balance sheet swell. So, if you go back to last year, you\u2019ll see similar trends. ", "So, no, we are on track for our guidance of about $3 billion in CapEx this year and certainly continuing to modernize hubs is important. Myron, maybe you could talk a little bit about the status and benefits of that.", "Myron Gray", "Allison, there is a five-year plan that\u2019s in place to either add capacity or modernize all of our top 30 hub locations. At the end of this year, we\u2019ll have four projects that will be totally completed with adding capacity in two locations and hub models and two others. And certainly they are put in place to increase our throughput and our productivity. ", "Allison Landry ", "Okay, thank you for the time. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins ", "Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. So, I guess just, for my question, you're thinking about the US Freight economy, there is a lot of concern out there that we're beginning to see things perhaps slowdown a little bit. Could you give us a sense for what you are seeing in your underlying business in the US? And then, what are you learning in your conversations with your customers as it relates to freight demand for the balance of the year?", "David Abney", "Okay, first when it comes to the US, the outlook is certainly mixed. I mean there were some recent disappointing employment news in March and we\u2019ve seen IP and the retail data maybe be not as positive as we would have thought. ", "There are some headwinds. We talked a little bit about the West Coast Port, don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to fade away pretty quickly of if this is going to continue. But the strengthening US dollar and the cautious consumer when it comes to spending, but then on the bright side, you see that, ASMO has gotten off to a strong start this year. January over 14% and February, almost that same level. So, I would say that, it\u2019s just a mixed performance. We are focused on maintaining our strategies and I think it was a good solid performance for the first quarter. But there are some headwinds out there. ", "Jack Atkins ", "Thanks, again.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson Company. Please go ahead.", "David Campbell ", "Yes, hi. Thank you, Kurt. Congratulations and thanks for all your help over the years especially at our analyst conferences. I wanted to ask you about the West Coast Port disruption in the first quarter, I couldn't tell whether that was a help on the Cargo revenues or International shipments or both?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I think, depending on which segment of the business you talk to they, that are enjoyed it or struggled with it. So, Jim, maybe you could talk a little bit about the West Coast disruption in general and how that impacted results.", "Jim Barber", "Sure, I think that, David, I think it\u2019s in all segments. I think, from a Cargo perspective, our first quarter was very big, no question about that. That was up heavy double-digits and that actually runs through obviously the impact of the small package network we had trade-ups from \u2013 into the Air segment from our Freight business and we also had some moving into small package business. ", "So I think, Kurt has framed it at somewhere between $5 million and $10 million impact to the first quarter. As a lift in total, we don\u2019t see that continuing long-term. Therefore, we kind of pull that out, but that\u2019s kind of the impact from this segment. ", "David Campbell ", "Okay, thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Bascome Majors ", "Thank you. So to follow-up on David and Rob's questions on the Domestic dim weight implementation, can you give us a little color on how much of the portfolio that you\u2019ve got on the dim weight schedule for 2015? And whether that's a two to three year implementation to get to 100 or close to 100 or kind of how you see that playing out from a delayed gratification perspective for some of these customers over the next year or two?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We are not sharing specific numbers, but Alan, maybe you could talk about the general approach.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "No, again, so, all of our \u2013 so all the packages in the US package portfolio are now dim weight eligible. So it really becomes a question, we are talking about really is, what\u2019s under the covers in the contracts and I think again, you are going to see what the work that we are doing with our customers to improve their packaging to reduce the size of their packages will probably be an offset to some of the gains we get from contracts expiring and being renewed with stronger dim weight language.", "Operator", "And our last question in queue will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker ", "Thanks very much operator. And gentlemen, thanks for the time. Kurt and Richard congratulations. Kurt, I will miss you. And I look forward to working with Richard. Just a question on the tax rate, given how big your International opportunities are - is there an opportunity to lower your tax rate at all by shifting revenue around the world?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, unfortunately, we are not a manufacturer that has a lot of discretion, Helane. So, certainly, we continue to look at our tax structure in the very high statutory rate of the US is a drag on US companies. And certainly, we are a great example of that. So, David constantly ask me that question and we do what we can. But, to some extent, we are a business where you have to operate where the volumes are. So there is not a tremendous amount of discretion. ", "But, as the International business continues to grow and we expand across the globe, that does have a somewhat beneficial effect that lowers it slightly, but still in the main \u2013 the majority of that does get hit with the US taxes. That\u2019s why we are big proponents of a more rational US tax platform and that would be a good step for us and help us compete more effectively across the globe.", "Helane Becker ", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Abney. ", "David Abney", "Okay, and thanks for your questions. I think as you can see today that, our answers were really focused about creating unique solutions to our customers to create more value on our pricing initiatives and obviously on increasing our operating efficiency. ", "But now, we are going to cut it a little bit short today to give Kurt a chance to say a few final words before closing out the call. Like many long time UPS employees, Kurt began his career as a package car driver, while in college and progressed quickly through management. ", "Whether working on international growth, expansion into the industry segments or integration of several strategic acquisitions, Kurt has contributed exceptional judgment and fresh perspectives. His partnership character and capacity to find solutions has helped UPS advance through many challenges while remaining true to the needs of our customers, shareowners, and employees. ", "Kurt is just a great example of a business executive first and a finance executive second. I appreciate his thoughtful candor and welcome his knowledge and broad perspective. While I\u2019ll personally miss Kurt as a partner and as a friend, I am happy to also announce Rich\u2019s appointment. Richard has been with the company nearly 34 years. I believe he will contribute the right mix of experience and new thinking to help UPS continue to attain profitable growth. ", "So, Kurt, it\u2019s all yours. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, thanks, David and thanks for letting me get the final word here. But now it\u2019s been a wonderful career at UPS and I\u2019ve been privileged to tackle a number of major projects working for this great company. ", "Certainly, the one event that comes to mind is when I first met many of you on the call, which was our IPO in 1999 and got the unique opportunity to be UPS\u2019s first Investor Relations Officer after a history of 92 years as a private company. ", "I was a bit overwhelmed at first, but was extremely proud to represent this great company as we migrated from the private company we were to the public markets and would like to thank a number of you on the call there for your professionalism over the years have given us the benefit of the doubt and helping us communicate the UPS story. ", "There have also been a lot other highlights along the way and in every case, my recollections will be strongly enhanced by the memory of working with such a great team that we have here at UPS. I\u2019ve had the great fortune from starting as a package driver to assuming the CFO role back in 2008 to have an incredible breadth of assignments and clearly it\u2019s truly transformed both me and my view of the world. ", "And so, I\u2019ve been honored to have served and helped position this company for the future. But I do know, it\u2019s now time to get out of the way and allow more capable executives like Richard to takeover, little younger, little faster, little smarter. He joins a dynamic management committee that has been assembled by David and together, they have both the vision and the dedication that will take UPS to new levels of success. ", "As the official old-timer on the UPS team, I am already dreaming about having some leisure time to do some of the other things I love, maybe learn how to play piano, get in shape and certainly work on my ass fishing will be good places to start. ", "In the near-term, I am looking forward to seeing many of the participants on today\u2019s call in the upcoming meetings or conferences that Richard and I make visits during this transition. So, thanks to everyone for your well wishes today and I look forward to seeing many of you as the part of our upcoming meetings. ", "With that, our call is adjourned.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations' First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now our pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning. Today, I'm joined by Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and future expectations.", "Before they begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2011 Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. ", "Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release.

[Operator Instructions] I thank you in advance for your cooperation. ", "Now let me turn it over to Scott.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. 2012 is off to a good start for a couple of reasons. First, we announced our intention to acquire TNT Express, an investment that will contribute to our growth for many years to come. ", "Secondly, looking more near-term, first quarter results built upon momentum from last year. We continue to see strong demand from UPS products and services, especially in the U.S. and Europe. Both the U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain and Freight segments delivered double-digit profit growth in the quarter. ", "Back in January, we discussed that expectations for the U.S. economy were improving, especially compared to the rest of the world. During the quarter, the most positive news has come from the U.S. where indications of economic rebound are evident. Retail sales have grown faster than expected, and the employment environment has improved. ", "On the other hand, economies in other parts of the world continue to face challenges. Europe struggles under austerity measures, and slowing growth persists out of Asia. ", "Despite this, we continue to see our export volume in both Europe and intra-Asia perform well. UPS is executing on its strategy of investing to grow with the announcement of 2 acquisitions. ", "First, in February, we acquired the European consumer delivery company, Kiala. Its retail delivery network and unique technology will benefit UPS, as we continue to look for ways to serve the growing B2C market, especially outside the U.S. As you know, last month, UPS announced an offer to acquire TNT Express. While we have not closed on the transaction, we have made initial contact with the regulators. ", "UPS remains confident it will receive all required approvals. The acquisition of TNT will diversify our global revenue, increasing our portfolio of solutions and expanding our geographic footprint. We're excited about the prospects of adding such a strong and respected company to the UPS family. ", "During the quarter, UPS received accolades from a number of organizations for our reputation, ethics and brand. One of the more widely recognized honors we received was the #1 ranking with Fortune Magazine as our industry's most admired company. This is the 27th time UPS has received this recognition in the 31 years the award has been given. ", "Also during the quarter, UPS My Choice, the B2C solution we introduced in October, surpassed 1 million subscribers. UPS has received a positive response from customers, as they enjoy unprecedented levels of visibility and control over their deliveries. ", "Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to congratulate the almost 6,000 members of the UPS Circle of Honor: Individuals who have achieved 25 years or more of accident-free driving. In fact, this year, we recognized our first driver to surpass the 50-year milestone. That's truly amazing. This is just one example of how these drivers and the rest of the approximately 400,000 UPS's around the world contribute to our company's success. ", "As you can see, 2012 is off to a good start. UPS continues to be a global leader, investing for growth, developing innovative solutions and continuing to build on our corporate legacy. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Kurt to review the results for the quarter.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Yes, we are off to a good start. Daily package volume for the quarter was up a strong 4.3%, as online shipping continued the rapid growth seen last quarter. Boosted by strong results from the U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain and Freight segments, earnings per share grew 10%. ", "Let's take a look at the segments. Operating profit for the U.S. Domestic segment jumped 13% on revenue growth of 6.1%. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to the highest first quarter margin for this segment since 2008. ", "Our package volume increased 4.5%. Deferred products were up 10%, as online retailers clearly recognize the value of using our network to expedite the movement of goods to their customers. ", "Our Next Day Air volume increased 5%, with Next Day package up 6.5%. And some gains in letter volume, something, frankly, we've not seen in many quarters. ", "Our Next Day Saver product was the primary source of growth, as residential deliveries for large e-commerce shippers continued to expand. Ground shipments rose 4%, with approximately half of the growth resulting from a 30% increase in lightweight products. These solutions are proving to be very popular with our customers and are creating connectivity to other UPS products. ", "As we saw in the fourth quarter, the strong demand for saver and lightweight products, like SurePost, impacted yield growth. Base pricing was up about 2.5% to 3%, but it was somewhat offset by changes in product and customer mix that I just discussed. ", "The impact on yields will begin to moderate as we wrap the buildout of our SurePost launch. This will become most evident by the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, while these trends negatively impact yield, they do have a positive impact on our cost to serve and on our capital consumption. ", "Direct labor hours, block hours and miles driven all increased at a rate significantly less [ph] than the 4.5% volume growth. Operating leverage was also apparent in the quarter, as we continue to improve efficiency, benefiting from productivity gains, greater economies of scale and a mild winter. ", "Now turning to the International segment. Although we face some challenges, primarily due to shifting trade patterns, our international export volume continues to perform well, up 5.4%. Average daily volume comparisons did benefit by about 1% due to year-over-year differences in local operating days. ", "Looking at the regions, exports increased at a mid-single digit pace for both Europe and the Americas. However, our long higher-yielding lanes out of Asia were relatively flat. We also saw European shippers increasing their reliance on our standard products. ", "International yield growth was flat, as the benefits from the fuel surcharge and base rate increases were offset by the impact of shorter trade lanes, changes in product mix and the impact to currency. ", "On a currency-neutral basis, yield was up 2%. The International segment operating profit came in at $408 million. Currency translation and rising fuel costs accounted for over 1/3 of the $45 million decline, although our operating margin of 13.8% remains industry-leading. ", "Moving onto Supply Chain and Freight. Operating profits increased substantially, up 19%, with forwarding and distribution leading the way. The segment did receive a $9 million benefit from the sale of a surplus facility. ", "Revenue for the Forwarding business declined due to lower tonnage in yields, as excess capacity remained in the market. However, operating profit and margin improved due to growth in customized solutions and brokerage services in addition to improved productivity. ", "The Distribution business saw profit expansion in an environment of increased investment in health care capabilities. UPS expects to add 5 new health care compliant facilities this year around the world, bringing our total to 38 dedicated facilities. ", "And what is typically the most challenging quarter for the industry, our UPS Freight unit broke even. Tonnage declines were offset by higher revenue per 100 weight and improved productivity. ", "Looking now at cash and our balance sheet. UPS generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow during the period. Capital expenditures were $417 million, including the delivery of 3 additional 767s, bringing our total fleet count to 226 aircraft. In the quarter, the company repurchased more than 7 million shares for approximately $550 million. Less than expected, as internal guidelines caused us to restrict purchases during the TNT acquisition negotiations. ", "As UPS prepares to close on this transaction, we are reviewing multiple alternatives for financing. Although our plans are not yet finalized, we remain committed to the preservation of a strong balance sheet and our dividend approach. And under any scenario, we do expect significant share repurchases in 2012 and beyond. We are evaluating our options and will update you on our decision. ", "Regarding guidance. UPS is right where we expected to be at the end of the first quarter, so our full year guidance remains unchanged. We anticipate 2012 diluted earnings per share of between $4.75 to $5, which represents a 9% to 15% increase over 2011. I do, however, want to take a couple of minutes to provide more insight into the remaining quarters.", "On a consolidated basis, second quarter earnings per share is anticipated to grow at a similar pace to the first quarter. Third quarter earnings per share growth should be a bit lower due to one less operating day compared to last year's. And we expect fourth quarter earnings to grow at the fastest pace. This is due to the operating leverage generated by peak season volume growth and our proven ability to efficiently process e-commerce shipments. ", "Our guidance for the U.S. Domestic segment remains consistent with what we told you back in January. For the full year, we expect to generate high single-digit operating profit growth. Although our expectations are for 2% to 3% base pricing, yield growth will be muted by changes in product and customer mix. And we do anticipate average volume growth of 3.5% to 4%, with air growing slightly faster than ground. ", "Turning now to International. For the second quarter, we expect revenue trends to be similar to the first. Local day comparisons will negatively impact reported daily volume growth, a reversal of what we saw in the first quarter. Although we expect operating profit to improve compared to the first quarter, it will be relatively flat to last year. ", "Beyond the second quarter, year-over-year comparison should improve. For the second half of 2012, we expect operating profit growth in the mid-teens on high single-digit revenue improvement. ", "Regarding Supply Chain and Freight, we expect second quarter revenue growth to be similar to the first quarter and operating margin to be relatively flat compared to last year. ", "Looking at the second half of 2012, we anticipate operating profit growth of mid- to high-teens on high single-digit revenue growth. ", "So all in all, we're off to a good start to what should be an exciting year for UPS. Although market dynamics continue to change, UPS will benefit by adapting to them. Whether it's e-commerce growth, shifting trade patterns or demographic changes, UPS has the capabilities to meet the challenges. ", "Thanks for listening this morning. And now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, maybe a question, I guess, on the yield side. I just wanted to kind of tease out a little bit of the mix kind of impact as you go forward here and think about it. Is it 2Q and 3Q before 4Q you start to see a little bit of improvement where we can actually see that core yield growing in the kind of 2% to 3% range?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. Certainly, the dramatic impact we've seen in our lightweight products has changed the shape of what you guys see anyway. The -- but the core underlying philosophy we have for pricing has not changed. On an account-by-account basis, our discipline and approach is the same. Individual customers are all being reviewed, and we are executing our normal yield processes. And if you look at Q4, really, the trends, if you take out fuel surcharge changes, the trends are really pretty stable. The only product, really, that sees any notable difference in changes, our Next Day product, where the substantial growth of the Saver product, which is the afternoon delivery, does come in at a lower yield, but generates substantially lower cost and so profits are good. But to answer your question directly, yes, what you really see is, as we just really initiated the SurePost at the beginning of last year, it ramped up and really began to hit its stride in Q4. So the year-over-year comps will moderate over the year. In Q4, you'll see more of the core underlying base rates that we've talked about.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Nate Brochmann of William Blair.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I wanted to talk a little bit just on that question strategically. I mean, obviously, you have the benefits of the integrated network and probably can ship pretty easily. But what are you having to do with the network to kind of accommodate the new SurePost product? And how do you kind of adjust the rest of the network to accommodate the faster pace of e-commerce that's obviously growing pretty rapidly?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, I think the thing that gives us some confidence that this is actually a positive trend for UPS is that with the deep integration we've done of these products through every component of our business, it flows through very smoothly, it utilizes existing assets and the incremental impact on the network is minimal. As we mentioned, our hours, our miles and those things are just barely up for the quarter, even though we showed some of the strongest volume growth you've seen in some time. Another great proof point of that is, I guess, if you look at the compensation and benefits, it's up 4% over year-on-year on 4% volume increase. So we are able to process this volume very efficiently, and the incremental impact on expense and capital is very minimal.", "D. Scott Davis", "And, Nate, I think things we're doing, like the My Choice, helps us get that delivery there the first time, has the consumer take control of it and get the delivery the first time. Kiala, the acquisition in Europe, looks at alternative delivery. Location's the same thing. We are having more deliveries, helps the density as opposed to the one package to one house. So the variety of things we're doing is helping that.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "So it's an interesting time for us. We are seeing changing mix and at a rate that's more frequent and more significant than you'd normally seen. The core underlying momentum of the business remains very steady and our approach to the market is unchanged. Layering on top of that then, though is this rapid expansion of products frankly, that we haven't competed for in the past.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to touch on, I think, the kind of broader topic you're talking about here with B2C and the impact as well. If I look at fourth quarter, I think you've seen a pretty big favorable impact for B2C growth. And you see that in the deferred air, certainly. And you had a very strong incremental margin. I calculate just simply on the Domestic Package, 52%. It seems that your mix effect is probably similar in first quarter with a lot of growth in B2C. But the incremental margin shows up as 25% in Domestic Package. So I'm wondering if you can just talk about what the differences in the 2 would be. Because I guess looking at margin performance, that kind of helps us figure out whether it's good business or how good the business is that you're bringing on.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, Tom, it's a lot of moving parts to try to decompose incremental margin quarter-to-quarter, I guess. And clearly, we talked at some length about the Q4 and the process there. Certainly, in Q4, these trends were even more extreme. And as we mentioned during December, over half of our volume in aggregate was B2C. We feel good about the domestic margin expansion. We saw a full 70-basis point expansion. We expect margin expansion to continue with these trends.", "D. Scott Davis", "I think, typically, Tom, you're going to see that kind of change from Q4 to Q1. There's certainly some seasonality to that.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Would you think that incremental margin would accelerate then through the 2012? Or it's more of kind of fourth quarter is just different than you see in any of other quarters?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "We're more focused on overall total margin improving than the calculation of the incremental margin quarter-to-quarter. We are confident that we're going to continue to increase the margins on the domestic side and work towards our long-term target.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, I think, as we said in January as far as our margin goals domestically, we feel extremely confident, frankly, a little ahead of target right now.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Maybe I can come at that a little bit differently. Just it\u2019s typically the first quarter is impacted by weather and you obviously didn't have that this year. Yet, the volumes in the first quarter were the highest you've posted kind of relative to the rest of the year. So what occurs in the first quarter that pushes your overall margins to be the lowest? Again, I just want to dig into the understanding of that incremental concept of why we see this lower, given the beneficial weather and environment?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, we did see significant improvements in margin. Q1, historically, is a tougher year. You still have winter weather and lower aggregated volumes typically versus the year spend overall. I mean, certainly there are some headwinds in the quarter. Fuel was a bit of a headwind with the rising fuel and the like and the surcharge. We do have some increased pension expenses, although, we'll see those all year, and that's in our guidance. So we're pretty comfortable with the 70-basis point improvement. Q1 is not typical of the entire year, and we expect to see margin continuing to increase over that. On the flip side, clearly, the -- we did -- this was a pretty benign weather period for Q1, and that helped to offset some of the things that I just mentioned. So we're pretty pleased just on, domestically, we're getting back to margins that we've not seen since early '08, and we expect them to continue to grow.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So just to understand that, there is something in the first quarter that keeps it lower than what you see in second and third quarter, despite volume declines on a relative basis in 2 and 3Q relative to what you see in the first quarter.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Historically, yes, Q1 is a challenging quarter for us in domestic because of the weather. As is Q3, usually the most challenging quarter in the international because of European holidays. So I think if you look those are pretty typical seasonal pattern.", "Andy Dolny", "[Operator Instructions]", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I just wanted to talk about international and thinking about it over the course of the next 2 or 3 years, the margin performance in particular. In the release, you talked about changing product mix in shifting trade patterns as being one of the contributing factors to the margin declines year-over-year. So just trying to get a handle around how big of an impact that's going to be, given the changes in trade patterns expected going forward. And if we can kind of talk about it irrespective of TNT and just think about kind of shorter lengths of haul or changing lengths of haul, and what impact that might have over the next 2 or 3 years in terms of progress toward what you had talked about, I guess, late last year at the Analyst Day in terms of the ability to get back to 18-plus percent margins in the segment.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, clearly, it is a moving target right now. And we have seen, really, for the last 3 quarters, I guess, Asia be a bit of a challenge. It at least was more or less of a breakeven this quarter. So we did see an impact where the long-distance highest yield lanes, mainly Asia to Europe and the U.S., were relatively flat. Whereas we saw robust growth on intra-Asia and the European volumes, most of the exports, which tend to stay in the continent. I think over the medium term, we adjust all those in our combination of an air and ground network, allows us to create economic value out of both. Certainly, the capital demands of the intra-European volume are much less than dedicated high-value of assets flying 6,000, 7,000 miles. Although it does create challenges as those transitions happen. So we feel pretty good actually that we're in great shape to handle that. Whether it's regional trade patterns across North America or Europe, we can adapt and certainly be profitable. But it does have some impact on margins in the transition.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, I think, longer-term, I think global trade is going to stay strong. I don't think you're going to see, long term, these trade flows change that dramatically. I think some of that Asia impact clearly has been weaker consumer demand in Europe than in last year, consumer demand in the U.S. which is picking up now. So I think we're fairly optimistic. You're going to see later this year some of the Asia export numbers start picking up again. So I think this is kind of a temporary predicament we're in right now.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, and I guess, just to reinforce, we are not sitting on our hands just watching these patterns change and not reacting. We are continuing to make network adjustments. We've -- if you look year-over-year, we've taken our Asia capacity down about 10%. We have some additional things that have been rolled out to maintain the kind of service levels we want, but at the same time, reduce our exposure. We continue to show great growth within our European capabilities, but we're also cautious. And so we have a number of operating cost initiatives there. We have seen some increase in consumers' choice of our lower-value products. And so there is definitely some trade down, which over time, is -- it can be adjusted because things like time of day and those, we reduce our cost, but it does require aggressive cost focus to get there. And at the same time, we're looking at revenue management strategies to make sure that we are extracting the value we should and being paid for the services. So there's a number of initiatives in the international to adapt. And we do -- clearly, we're not thrilled with the Q1 performance in international. It was a challenging quarter for us and, I think, for most players. But we've got pretty good plans and that's why we're confident in our results going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Outside of the mix issues with SurePost, it does seem like domestic volumes, particularly the Next Day Air, particularly spiked in the first quarter while the yields declined. Is there some intentional market share gains you're looking for in the Next Day Air? And can you talk to SurePost? And is that all recorded within ground? Or is there some of that, that impacts what the yields might look like in any of the air products?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Ed, I think there is some indirect benefit. I mean, SurePost is just one product in the portfolio. And I think as we've mentioned since we first introduced this, it is part of an overall combined value propositions for customers. So typically, for every SurePost product, there's 5 or 6 other packages through our traditional ground service or our air products. So there is some portfolio benefit, I guess. But we did see the e-commerce momentum that is clearly pushing our results right now, ripple through both to air and ground. I think in the fourth quarter, we talked about that being a big impact on our deferred air, as a lot of the premium retailers are taking advantage of the time-definite services. We're also seeing some of that ripple into the Next Day also. And it did create surprisingly strong growth in our Next Day product. The vast majority of that, as I said, is our Next Day Saver, which has no time-of-day commitment. So it really looks and feels to us like a traditional ground product, but it relies in our air network. So it is a good product for us. It doesn't have the kind of high delivery cost that a time-committed air product does. So we're very confident that it is good volume for us and that we can handle those e-commerce shippers' needs very appropriately.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, Ed, as Kurt said, clearly, the big change was I think the large online retailers looking for that competitive advantage and going to the Next Day Saver product. We are focused on that base rate 2% to 3% increase, and we're holding to that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "The big mix shifts going around and the previous 2 questions have addressed this as well. I think you did a great job, saying, okay, what's going on in Southeast Asia we think was kind of a shorter term issue related to consumerism. But how much of the mix shift and the shift down the product chain do you think is structural and kind of a longer-term fact of life, which it's sounding more like the U.S. is as opposed to just shorter term, this trade lane wasn't here or customers were just a little bit conservative with their product choices in a tough economy.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I don't think we're overly concerned on that, Jeff. I mean, clearly, Europe is a bit of a wildcard right now. So that's probably the area where there's the most movement. It's also a market that's not as mature for product differentiation. What we call our standard product, in a lot of cases, exceeds the delivery commitments of other companies' express products. So there may be some settling on it. But I don't -- we don't see this as a big risk. It's more a matter of adapting and having the appropriate capacity, both for the overnight services and then the definite [ph] services. So we don't see it as a long-term risk, I think. It's more of just a bit of a moving target. And as economies -- economic conditions get challenging, we do see customers tightening up a little bit and extending their time commitments and to save a little money on transportation.", "D. Scott Davis", "But what is not changing though is the growth of B2C. And that really benefits the small-package industry, and we're going to benefit from that. And that's some -- where you've seen some of the package volume grow. Now our job is to figure out the best way to serve that. And that's why we did the Kiala acquisition to help with the density on residential shipments on alternative delivery locations. That's why we did My Choice. So that trend will not change going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Can you guys put some numbers around the sequential shift in B2C? You talked about 50% of domestic in December. I guess I'm just trying to get at this in a different way and get a handle on back to Tom's question. Has that shifted and incremental margins move down sequentially? I guess I'm trying to understand if some of this business that's come on in the B2C space is coming on at discounted pricing because you're getting good volume through your network from like an Amazon Prime or somebody like that who's able to deliver big volume, and so it gives you good utilization, but you're willing to take a step down on the pricing on that product in order to get that and maybe get a foot in the door to raise price in a better time period. So I'm trying to understand how that mixed shift is working and the sequential change in the B2C percentage.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, we are seeing some market shifts in the customer composition in the B2C space. Clearly, there has been consolidation. If you look back 5 years ago or more, there were more numerous players all vying to create market share in the B2C. And we have seen both some of the big traditional retailers become much more focused on it and some of the pure plays, like you mentioned. So, no, there is absolutely a large customer impact right now. We're seeing overall greater growth in large customers and small customers that does tend to reduce yields, but they also bring significant economies of scale, both in direct expense and in support expense because we can connect electronically to them. So that is a trend very much that's in place. Larger customers in general are outperforming. We've talked before about small business and the challenges they're facing. Nonetheless, across-the-board, on our revenue management, we are managing the customers and extracting base rate increases.", "D. Scott Davis", "Again, this is not a new trend. Back in September at our investor conference, we shared with you our long-term targets for domestic operating profit growth and domestic margin growth, and we're right on target. So I feel very confident with those long-term targets.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Raymond James.", "Arthur W. Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I was going to ask about the mixed shift, but I'm going to move on from that. I want to move on to the margins in Supply Chain and Freight. If I recall, and I can't remember what you said recently, but over the long haul, you always had a focus on that kind of high single-digits, roughly 7% -- I think 7% to 8%. You're kind of there in Q1. Can you talk a little bit about how you feel about where those margins are now in Supply Chain and Freight? And if you think you can get those up to double-digit levels?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, thanks, Art, for giving us something else to talk about here. No, we feel pretty good that this capability we built of an integrated Supply Chain and Freight offering is continuing to pay some dividends. We -- margins were very strong in the quarter. Although, clearly, the growth was more muted, as some of the buy rates on the forwarding side have come down over time. And we were able to adjust and adapt and taking cost out. So we feel great on that front. The distribution group is a great asset. We are investing right now, but we've been able to maintain decent margins there, even with the headwind of deep investment in health care. And then our UPS Freight group clearly has a lot of opportunity going forward. Their results were relatively flat in this quarter, but we're making great progress on differentiating ourselves and trying to strike a balance between being a disciplined yield player and still generating good growth.", "D. Scott Davis", "And that's what makes it -- that margin that much greater because when freight starts kicking in, then you can see better margins there.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Hey, I just -- I'm sorry to beat this dead horse, but I just want to understand when you have conversations with your customers and they're considering moving to a SurePost or a product like that, how does this conversation go? Because I think all of us sort of look at this and say, it's not just the yield mix risk, there's a profit risk mix as well. And I know you're aware of sort of the risks there. But how do you ensure that you can keep defenses up and keep premium ground. Because ground is so good for you that I'd think by offering your SurePost, you'd create some risk of cannibalization of your own very good business. So how do you manage that? How do you think about that?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, I think, Bill, it's a portfolio management issue. I mean, we've always faced that issue as having such an integrated network. It's very easy for customers to move from 8:00 a.m. air to 10:30 to Saver to 2-day air products to ground. So it's not a new concept at all for us. And I think, if anything, we've had a lot of experience. We do -- the SurePost is one piece of a puzzle, but what it really is, is it's giving us now a relevance in a very lightweight in to the market than in a lot of cases where we weren't relevant before. So there's always cannibalization risk. But at the same time, we're continuing to differentiate our ground product. If you use SurePost, you can't take the advantages of the great UPS pickup and delivery network as much, you don't have the capabilities with My Choice to redirect deliveries. So it's a multi-tiered strategy of differentiating the UPS ground product, but at the same time, offering a different alternative for very lightweight, low-value shipment. So is there risk to it? Absolutely. Do we talk about those things? Those are critical marketing issues, and the appropriate approach is what we've done from years, is to create differences across our product line, price those appropriately and then let customers take advantage of it. So the vast majority of what we're seeing is new volume coming in that we hadn't been really targeting. Is there some transition from our basic product, which was a start on this into SurePost? Absolutely. But in aggregate, it's bringing more volume in all fronts across rather than cannibalizing.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "You talked a little bit about pulling down buybacks in the quarter. Can we expect that to get made up in the second and third quarter? Can you give us a little bit more insight as to what you're expecting on that front?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, we -- once we got hot and heavy on the discussions with TNT, it was appropriate for us to restrict our purchases in the market. Fortunately, we had put in some accelerated share repurchases before that started. So we weren't -- we were able to at least continue to purchase that reasonable amount of shares. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are revisiting a number of alternatives for how we finance and structure the acquisition -- pending acquisition of TNT. And we do expect to reach conclusion on that in the not too distant future. We intend to maintain a very strong balance sheet. Our dividend policy will remain unchanged. But we are reviewing the purchase -- the repurchase strategy. And we do expect to be a significant buyer of stock under all scenarios. But at least at this point, we're not ready to lock in guidance as far as repurchases in the short to medium term. We'll give you guys an update on that not too far in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So if I take a step back, earnings were up 10% year-over-year this quarter. The midpoint of the range implies 12% earnings growth. So you've got to grow low teens for the rest of the year. And there are a lot of different moving parts. You've identified a number of them. And I promise I'm not asking you to write my note for me. But could you rank prioritize let's say the 3 key bullet points why is year-over-year earnings growth going to accelerate as this year progresses? Because it does seem that you had some tailwinds, so whether it's productivity from good weather in the U.S. or additional operating days in Asia.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, although Andy said he would volunteer to write your note for you. He just wants you to know.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I don't think my boss would let me, but...", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, no, as we said, we actually are right on target for what we expected. There may be a couple of you that got a little ahead, but it's -- there's not dramatic differences, I think. We do have some headwinds with fuel moving up a little bit this quarter and the currency wasn't particularly friendly. Those things -- we expect currency, clearly, to moderate with our hedges in place. So the international gets a little bit of help there. We do expect our ability to adjust and adapt to the international, so we're going to -- we showed negative earnings declines in Q1 for international. We do not expect those going forward. We're going to see improved results. And the business momentum, we feel is strong. I mean we feel great about what's going on in the Domestic business, 13% profit improvement. We feel the momentum in the Domestic business continues unabated. So we feel good about the U.S. economy. And we also saw some stability and firming in Asia, I think, in March and into April anyway. So we feel, in general, positive and think that the guidance is appropriate.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, I think when we gave the guidance in January, we talked about tough comparisons for forwarding and for international package in the first half of the year. Obviously, Asia fell off in August of last year, and the comps get much easier in the second half of the year for both the international package and forwarding. So like I say -- as Kurt said, we're right on target where we thought we'd be at this point in time.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.", "John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just in looking at this specific quarter and the next couple of quarters. Can you elaborate at all, were there any costs associated with what you have done on TNT? And any costs associated with the expansion of airfreight capacity that you mentioned in your press release around Latin America that you can quantify, that would have impacted this specific quarter that might not be there on an ongoing basis? Kind of startup costs or onetime in nature, as you kind of tackle those 2 issues.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Clearly, we got a lot of people spending a lot of time in airplanes and other activities, John. But at least in the scheme of the scope of UPS, I'd hate to characterize those things as anything but negligible. We do have expenses everyday. Clearly, the Kiala acquisition, we've got work we're doing on that to build the capability across the globe. But in the scheme of things, most of that is not material. And the bulk of the expenses, clearly, with the potential TNT acquisition will be in Q2, Q3. And as it gets to be material, we will discuss and give you guys clarity around those. So at this point, they're more of a rounding issue.", "John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And in the expansion in Latin America?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Just -- well, that's just part of our overall dynamic air fleet network. It does add some expense as we add capacity there. But once again, not enough to hugely move the needle. But that's -- I mean, some of the steps we make now will position us well and that's part of why we're giving the guidance we are going forward.", "D. Scott Davis", "The biggest drag on international clearly was fuel cost, it was currency and slow growth out of Asia.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just want to come back to this Next Day Saver product that you guys are definitely showing quite a bit of growth in. It's been my understanding that, at least historically, some of your highest cost operations are delivering those Next Day packages to residential addresses. So how is that levering into your network here where you can get similar profit profile on those new packages?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "That's a great question. And that is really why the Saver distinction is so critical for residential. It is very challenging for us or anybody to work their way out to a residential suburban area and make an 8:00 a.m. commitment. Or in some cases, even a 10:30 commitment. You do what we call break trace. You go off the optimal travel path or you have to have a dedicated driver driving it out there. With the Saver agreement, we get it there next-day guaranteed, but we have the flexibility to deliver it in the afternoon. So we're able to deliver that package during the normal optimal trace that all of our great operational technology tells us we should. But there's a dramatic reduction in operating expense in return for not having that early-morning commitment. Most consumers aren't driving to get the thing first thing in the morning. If they are, then the product would not be Saver. So it's a great way to generate next-day air yields, but have a minimal impact on the pickup and delivery operation and utilize our integrated network. One other interesting anecdote, which I mentioned earlier, was we did see growth in our letter products that we are seeing a beginning of an uptick in refinancing applications in the mortgage industry. So that's another nice trend that has taken letters from being negative to positive and that this is the first quarter in some time that we've seen that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Company.", "David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company", "During your initial comments, you said the international trends and revenue trends in the second quarter would be like the first quarter. But there's been substantial rate increases, sea freight and some in airfreight, and some, as you mentioned, firming in the Asia-Pacific market. So I'm kind of surprised that the revenue growth will be the same as the first quarter.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, there -- the first quarter was almost -- you can almost split the first quarter into half as far as the airfreight market. We were very disappointed in January results. And then, February didn't fully compensate for it. So it was a challenging period. In March, as some of the big product launches came out, then there was an improvement in demand and yields did move up. So it's hard that the first quarter was really a tale of 2 different cycles any way. We've seen demand stabilize a bit. Although I don't get a sense that yields are moving up significantly in the airfreight industry right now. If anything, there may be a slight decline having forwarded.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on the international business. I know you've mentioned that Asia to U.S. and Asia to Europe was a little bit soft. And you characterized it mainly as a consumer concern on the delivery side of that. But are you seeing anything with your customers that are relocating any of their manufacturing facilities back to North America, for example? And is there maybe some underlying structural trend that will weigh on outbound Asia volumes going forward?", "D. Scott Davis", "I don't think so, Chris. I mean I think there's some of that and there is -- we're seeing some manufacturing growth in the United States. But I don't think we're seeing a dramatic shift at this point in time. I think what will drive that shift is energy prices if they climb. I think that a big change in lanes, I think, would be if energy prices do climb a lot then you will see some near sourcing. But today, I don't think there's dramatic shift yet.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "With UPS Freight, surprised by the tonnage decline there. It seemed to be an easy comp quarter and industry volumes were higher, especially with yields not being too great either. Can you talk a little bit about why the negative volume there?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, it's a combination of kind of us trying to find the right balance of growth in yields and also some tough comps to last year. We had a pretty strong quarter last year with substantial growth in both yields and shipments. And we are seeing some moving patterns. Some of the players in the market are getting a little more aggressive. So we're trying to find a middle ground right now as things stabilize. So we feel good that the business unit's making good progress, but we are trying to be selective and continuing to focus more on the middle market areas than an across-the-board growth strategy.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line Of Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose.", "Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "So you have, I think, a pilot contract that came due recently. Can you just give us an update on how the negotiations were going and what the timing is using for resolving that?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, Helane, the contract became amendable and we are having discussions. But I'd say we're early on the discussion at this point in time. Typically, in pilot negotiations, they don't get completed until 2, 3 years after the amendable date. We're hoping to get it done sooner than that. But so far, early in discussions and they are underway.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I thought it would be helpful if you could give us a little breakdown in terms of what the composition of the yields were. I know you talked about kind of 2% to 3% base price. But can you run through on, let's say, the air express -- I don't know if you want to do air express and ground. But how much is price? How much is change in weight per piece? And then how much is fuel impact just to give us a little better sense of what's really driving the yields?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, Tom, we did see a big impact on overall weight. The ground was down a couple of percent in aggregate and our air products were down 4% to 5%. So that's a fairly large piece. The -- probably the most notable issue, and that encompasses both the mix of the B2C, which tends to be lighter, and the lightweight focus. The core underlying base rate, in most cases, is 2% to 3% customer-to-customer. So the changing mix, both of lower service, with Saver, for example, where there is a yield hit. Although, as we mentioned there's an offsetting price benefit. As I mentioned, Q4 to Q1, the trends are very similar for ground and deferred air, if you take out fuel surcharge. Next Day Air shows a bigger difference because of the substantial increases we're seeing on the Saver side and the weight being letters. So all in all, the base rates, as we factor out those things, are very steady at the 2.5% to 3%. Ground, a little better than that average. Air maybe a little below that average. But we know that on a customer-by-customer basis, as we do our customer strategies, those yield and freezes are happening. But with the significant mix change, it has masked that a bit.", "Operator", "Due to time constraint, our last question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C.

Yes, David, we're -- I think we're making good process. I guess, what's happened since we had our call back on March 19 announced the deal is one that TNT's held their annual meeting, which I thought gone quite well, which is I think is important to get a perspective of where there shareowners are. We have had discussions with the regulators a couple of meetings so far. We're working through the process. So far, so good. Probably, the next big thing is we're going to file the offer memorandum by May 11 with the AFM, so that's a big next step.

My name is Cheryl and I will be your conference facilitator today. We apologize for the technical difficulties. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relation second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. ", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining us today. Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, are ready to provide insight into the company\u2019s second quarter results and our expectations going forward. Before I turn the program over to them, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. ", "Some of the comments we\u2019ll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2007 Form 10-K and first quarter 2008 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS investor relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. ", "This conference call is being webcast and will be available on our investor relations website for a few weeks. ", "In his remarks, Kurt will refer to UPS' cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Reconciliation is included with the news announcement this morning and is available on the UPS IR website. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Scott. ", "D. Scott Davis", "Good morning. It\u2019s obvious to everyone in the business world that economic conditions in the U.S. continue to slow. Economists hold a bleaker outlook for the second half of this year and it was the case even three months ago. Soaring fuel prices, falling housing starts, increased unemployment, weaker consumer confidence -- all of this paints a picture of a faltering economy. ", "While GDP and industrial production may bottom out in the second half of this year, recovery is expected to be a slow, drawn-out process. Predictions are that it will be 2009 before improvement in the economy becomes apparent. ", "Deteriorating economic conditions and high fuel prices had a significant negative impact on our package business. Volumes in our premium products declined at a greater pace than in the first quarter and our costs increased. We\u2019re feeling the impact of higher energy costs throughout the company, not just at the fuel pump. This includes such items as purchased transportation and increased utility expense. ", "I assure you that we are pursuing a range of initiatives to address today\u2019s marketplace challenges and trends. Some of these will have short-term benefits, others will take longer. Kurt will provide details shortly. ", "Despite the difficult economic environment, UPS' focus is on long-term growth opportunities. Our investment to develop supply chain management capabilities, which is now paying dividends, is a good case in point. Going forward, the proposed contract with DHL is another such opportunity. ", "As a reminder, we are developing a 10-year agreement with DHL to provide air lift for their express, deferred, and international volume within the U.S., in between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Both sides are working diligently and making good progress towards concluding this agreement. This illustrates how UPS is looking outside the box to develop growth strategies that we might not have considered in the past. ", "Another great opportunity is China. We are the in-country sponsor of the upcoming Olympic Games in Beijing. Starting three years ago, UPS began working with the Beijing organizing committee to develop and manage logistics for the games. We\u2019re serving three Olympic villages, managing 35 game venues and four distribution centers, moving everything from kayaks to shotputs. ", "During peak operation, UPS will have 2,000 people and 138 vehicles on-site. This is a complex undertaking that demonstrates our broad, worldwide capabilities. Our goal is to be the leading global package delivery, freight, and logistics company in China. This sponsorship is an important step in strengthening our brand presence in this key market. ", "Despite economic pressures, our service levels are at all-time highs and I am proud of the effort and dedication of the UPSers I see every day. Often in our history, we have dealt with challenging economic issues. For example, in the 1930s, UPS expanded its service area from the West Coast to the East at the height of economic turmoil. And in the \u201870s, we started to develop our international business in spite of the oil prices. In many ways, tough economic times have provided a launching pad for innovation that led to years of growth. ", "Despite the current challenges, we intend to do the same thing today -- adapt our business to meet current conditions and position our company for long-term growth and success. Remember, although these downturns in the economy are painful, the strongest companies, like UPS, will come out in the best competitive position. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Kurt for comments on the second quarter results and on our outlook for the rest of the year. ", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Thanks, Scott and good morning, everyone. As we look at the second quarter, three major trends affected our global package business -- escalating fuel prices, volume declines, and a sharper reduction in the use of premium products, that last two being related to economic conditions. ", "Fuel had a significant impact in the quarter, increasing $470 million, or 67% over last year. Fuel price increases had ramifications beyond just the direct cost. They caused our indirect expenses to accelerate. Items such as purchase transportation, utilities, and the costs for outside service providers around the world. ", "Crude prices increased from $100 a barrel in early April to $140 by the end of June. This rapid increase during the quarter magnified the impact of our fuel surcharge lag. As you know, there is a two-month delay in the application of fuel surcharges to capture this increased expense. This factor alone accounted for over half of the profit decline in both the U.S. domestic and international package segments. ", "The 1.3% decline in total U.S. domestic volume was a larger shortfall than we had expected. All products posted declines, from 6% on next day air products to a little less than 1% on ground. This is a good news/bad news story. Due to the investments we\u2019ve made in our broad product portfolio, we have retained customers and kept them in the portfolio. However, some of them shifted away from our premium products in an effort to control their own costs. These trends pressured our operating results. ", "The international segment performed significantly below our expectations because of volume, mix, and fuel price issues that I just discussed, and slowing economic conditions. Although export volume and revenue growth were robust, it should be noted that the 10% export growth was aided by the timing of Easter. Without this benefit, export volume would have increased around 8%. This is market leading growth. ", "Import volume into the U.S. from every region of the world declined, however, but strong intra-regional activity continued outside the U.S. The second quarter saw a rapidly changing business environment, with export volumes posting slower growth with each successive month of the quarter. The decline in the operating margin in this segment reflects those trends, although at almost 14% it remains the highest in the industry. ", "Costs in our international business are more fixed than in our domestic model, making it difficult to respond quickly to changing conditions. But we are executing initiatives to enhance profits in this business and expect to see benefits over the next few quarters. ", "If trade flows continue to change, we will adjust our network to ensure that it is properly aligned with volume and revenue growth patterns. ", "While adapting to the current environment, we are still investing to expand our global presence. During the quarter, we completed the network integration of Tamworth, our largest ground hub outside the United States. This will greatly improve efficiency in that region. ", "We also assumed full control of our joint venture operation in Korea, announced plans to move our intra-Asia air hub to Shenzhen from the Philippines to reduce transit times, and began flying five weekly flights between Nagoya, Japan and Shanghai to enhance customer service in Asia. ", "Most of the headwinds in our package business stem from economic slowdown and sky-rocketing fuel prices. As Scott mentioned, we have established short, medium, and long-term initiatives to identify actions and fundamental changes we can take to address the impacts of current economic realities. ", "Our short-term plans are focused on reducing costs for the rest of this year and next, while still supporting growth initiatives. For example, we\u2019ve eliminated hiring in non-sales positions, cut back on relocations, and reduced travel, among other things. We\u2019re also focused on operational efficiencies, in addition to numerous fuel conservation activities. ", "In the medium term, the focus is on increasing revenue while refining our operating model to adapt to today\u2019s business climate. This includes a range of initiatives, such as first, developing new revenue growth activities and a focus on revenue management; second, ensuring our global network is appropriately aligned with changing customer demand; and third, leveraging technology to both increase revenue and improve our efficiency. These kinds of initiatives will take effect in the near future and throughout 2009. ", "Longer term planning broadly addresses the structure of our network as fuel prices continue their dramatic escalation. We\u2019re looking at three fundamental questions -- how will our customers and their business models change? How do we leverage our global integrated network to best serve our customers and their changing trade patterns? And what new growth opportunities exist? This is a comprehensive scenario planning effort. As such, it entails a longer term view of our company and our industry, from various what if perspectives. And it will take some time before conclusions are reached. ", "However, I want you to know that we are always actively managing the business to control our destiny and continue to lead the industry. ", "Now, turning to supply chain and freight, this segment again exceeded our expectations. Revenue increased almost 11%, with profits up over 50%, led by forwarding and logistics. The air freight relaunch introduced in January has attracted new customers and many existing customers have also increased their use of our expanded range of freight services. The logistics unit maintained its focus on profitable revenue growth and it has developed superior capabilities in healthcare and high tech, and has new facilities coming online in Puerto Rico, The Netherlands, and Canada. ", "In the freight business, LTO revenue was up over 7% as strong yields continued to reflect the value of our service offering. Shipments declined 2.3%, although results strengthened month over month throughout the quarter. In addition, all productivity measures improved and technology, specifically World Ship and Quantum View, is driving new customer wins and increasing repeat business. ", "During the quarter, UPS freight expanded its reliability guarantee to shipments moving in and out of Canada, an extension of the guarantee put in place for U.S. shipments in January. It\u2019s a clear signal to our customers of the confidence we have in the improvements made at UPS freight. The freight unit also enhanced time in transit on nearly 1,000 lanes. ", "No quarterly update would be complete without touching on the company\u2019s financial position. For the first six months of 2008, UPS generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, invested almost $1.4 billion in capital expenditures, and paid dividends of over $1.3 billion. We also spent $2.4 billion to repurchase almost 35 million UPS shares. The company remains on pace with our repurchase program and has over $7.5 billion remaining of the $10 billion repurchase authorization. Even with this financial activity, we ended the first half of the year with $1.7 billion of cash and short-term investments. ", "Through the end of the second quarter, free cash flow approached $3.4 billion. This includes approximately $1 billion in federal cash tax benefits related to the company\u2019s withdrawal from the Central States pension plan. Our CapEx budget at $3 billion for 2008 will be below 6% of our revenues. This is towards the low-end of our historical range. ", "We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to cut or defer investment if we can, but we\u2019ll continue to invest for growth. The world port expansion, the Tamworth hub in England, and expansion plans in Asia are only some of the investments underway to meet anticipated needs down the road. ", "Now let\u2019s look to the future, and I\u2019ll address my remarks to the second half of 2008 in its entirety. Three months ago, we told you that we anticipated the domestic market would be flat to down 1% and that our volume would track market behavior. Current thinking is that the small package market will contract about 2% for the remainder of the year, as will our U.S. volumes, and we\u2019ll see a continued decline in premium product. ", "On the positive side, in August we will begin operating under the economics of the new labor contract, with its more moderate rate and hourly wage increases. This obviously will have a greater effect in the fourth quarter. ", "Domestic operating margins will remain below last year; however, they should improve over the first half of \u201908. The slow economic conditions that I mentioned earlier will cause our international segment to experience mid- to high-single-digit export volume growth with an operating margin in the mid-teens for the year. Remember, the third quarter is generally lighter in Europe due to a slow August. ", "And we expect the supply chain and freight segment to continue to show profit improvements over last year, with margins at or above 5%. ", "Given all these factors, and assuming business conditions remain reasonably steady, we expect results in the second half of this year to improve modestly over the first half, resulting in full year earnings per share within a range of $3.50 to $3.70. Comparisons to last year will be more difficult in the third quarter and moderate in the fourth. ", "In conclusion, I\u2019d like to remind you that UPS is no stranger to economic adversity. We have managed well through down cycles in the past and I am confident that we will do so again. ", "Now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question is coming from Jon Langenfeld of Robert Baird.", "Jon A. Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird ", "Good morning. Can you just talk a little bit about the demand destruction, a little bit more on the demand destruction on the domestic express side? First off, it looks like the surcharge is probably going to go from 24% in the second quarter to 34% in the third quarter, so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s more price elasticity you are going to bump up against here. ", "And then secondly, do you think historically, as customers have shifted away from express, is that a permanent shift or do they typically -- is there some element that comes back with better [accounting]? ", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "John, certainly that\u2019s been a topic that\u2019s had a lot of discussion lately. First off, this behavior is a typical cyclical process and in slow downs in the past, we have seen that our next day air products, and most premium products, are more economically sensitive. Frankly, when the economy is hot, there\u2019s more need to get goods urgently to their end destination. So it\u2019s important to keep that I perspective, that there\u2019s a substantial amount of these current trends that are seasonal, or cyclical. ", "On the other hand, clearly with fuel hitting unprecedented levels and the surcharges being high, there is increased pressure and customers are looking for ways to cut cost, and so we are seeing some shifts in our products. ", "Our sense is that that\u2019s probably beginning to stabilize. Clearly if fuel takes another run and we have a $40 increase over the span of the quarter, like we did in Q2, you know, it\u2019s very difficult to forecast. But we expect overall our surcharges to be up on the year about 8% this quarter, not quite as dramatic as you quoted. And our guidance clearly includes our outlook from continued declines in premium products. ", "D. Scott Davis", "Jon, we saw back in 2002 and 2003 that the express products were negative both years. Came back in 2004, next day grew 7% plus. I\u2019m not expecting 7% plus necessarily next year or two with the energy prices where they are but there\u2019s no reason to think they can\u2019t come back. ", "Jon A. Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird ", "Okay, good. Good color. And then the follow-up question was on the international trend. Did you see similar trends on the heavy weight freight side in your supply chain business, as you commented on the parcel business?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "A little bit, but not quite as dramatically, I guess. We have seen some recent numbers for May and June that suggests slowing. We had a good solid quarter. Clearly the freight coming into the U.S. has been anemic on the U.S. -- on our small package side. All regions of the world really were down as far as their shipments to the U.S. and we did see some slowing on the freight side, but we\u2019ve got a lot of new offerings. The air freight portfolio has been pretty well-received and that may be helping to offset some of it. And we continue to see strong growth in our Asia to Europe lanes, even though there\u2019s been some external discussions of that slowing. ", "Jon A. Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Wadewitz of J.P. Morgan.", "Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Good morning. Let\u2019s see, the first question on the competitive environment, can you give us a sense of whether the base rates have gotten more challenging -- base rate increases have gotten more challenging to achieve, in light of how much fuel surcharge customers are paying, and just whether the competitive dynamics have gotten a little bit worse or if they are still pretty stable?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, certainly with the surcharges in the air as high as they are, the fuel surcharge has become a part of price negotiations in an increasing fashion, and so it is much more a part of those discussions than it was before. And as a result, it gets a little harder to isolate pure price taking versus real surcharge. ", "But in general, the market\u2019s healthy. Pricing is very rational. Clearly this is a business where you\u2019ve got to cover your costs and grow -- the [loan] doesn\u2019t provide synergies if you are not in value. ", "You know, we are focused right now on making sure that we go through our customer base and that our rates and surcharges are appropriate. In some cases, there are caps on our fuel surcharge that seem pretty benign back a year ago that now are -- really don\u2019t fit the economics, so we do have some initiatives underway to recalibrate some of those and make sure that we find an appropriate balance of price for customers. ", "Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then the follow-up question, in terms of the margin performance, I know you highlighted fuel as being a pretty significant factor. I think you implied it would -- maybe $180 million operating income impact is the number I came up with, the way you characterized it. And I\u2019m wondering -- do you think margins will, year over year performance will be a lot better if we see fuel stabilize? Or is it really much more about the weakness in volumes and it\u2019s kind of hard to see margin trends improve at all without the volumes really changing?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Really, this whole fuel phenomena, you really have to separate into two buckets, Tom. One is the absolute level of fuel and the other is the rate of change. In the second quarter, the most notable difference was this rapid increase from crude of $100 to $140 by the end of the quarter. That\u2019s just unprecedented and that was the major impact that caused half of our operating profit declines in the package business. So the rapid increase is a short-term issue that as fuel prices stabilize, will cease being a headwind. And then if fuel prices drop significantly, we\u2019ll have a tailwind and finally recover the substantial amounts that we\u2019ve had shortfalls on as fuel [inaudible]. ", "The second issue is the absolute high level of fuel and that is one that will impact customer demand. Certainly it\u2019s driving cost, both in our fuel line and, as I mentioned, a lot of other line items. And there the issue is A, our ability to recover that cost, and B, the impact of those fuel prices on the economy. ", "So the short-term issue, things would stabilize. We would have less drag on our earnings as fuel stabilizes, although it would sure be nice to see a little decline in that, the cost, to get some real boost on the margins. ", "Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you for the time. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Edward Wolfe of Wolfe Research.", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Research  ", "Let\u2019s assume that the overnight doesn\u2019t come back, not because of the economy but because of fuel, and so growth starts to be in other, less high-yielding products on a secular basis. What can you do in your network and at what point could you improve domestic margins, do you think, given that context that the rest of the business is going to grow and the overnight air is on a secular decline? And then maybe as a follow-up, what the DHL contract -- could you give an update on how that might play into the whole thing?", "D. Scott Davis", "We\u2019ve been looking for months, doing some scenario planning on what happens if oil is at $150, what happens if oil is at $200 a barrel -- how does that change the business? Not only domestic air, but international? If we see prolonged, very high oil, you may see trade lanes change. You may see more near sourcing in the future, people building the goods closer to the end consumer. So we certainly tried to look at a lot of scenario planning from that standpoint. ", "There will be some challenges. Obviously some of the distances shipped may be shortened as we go forward, but there\u2019s going to some opportunities out there. We think that there\u2019s a -- I\u2019ve talked to a lot of CEOs who have company-owned fleets and have courier services that frankly are going to have a lot of trouble with these energy levels. So we see new markets that we really don\u2019t participate in today opening up and the efficiency of the UPS network, we see an awful lot of revenue opportunities. And again, that\u2019s all about utilizing our network more efficiently, which should help margins in the future. ", "So I think there are some challenges for us but there\u2019s also some great opportunities to move ahead. ", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Research  ", "But I\u2019m not talking about the revenue side. If you look at the cost side, can you get the costs to a position where the network can work with kind of a secular decline in air if other areas are growing? And then also on DHL, if you would. ", "D. Scott Davis", "I guess I\u2019ll answer that with the DHL question; clearly as we looked ahead, there is some risk to the domestic express market. As we look at the next four or five years, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to grow, be neutral, but clearly we lessened our risk with the DHL line haul contract. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re -- not having completed the contract yet, the teams are working, making an awful lot of progress. We think that\u2019s going to -- the additional volume we get out of that will clearly make for more efficiency, better asset utilization of our air network -- not just the airplanes, but also the hubs for so many purposes. So that\u2019s one major step, I think, in the better utilization of our network and possibly helping the margins  as we move forward. ", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Research  ", "What\u2019s the timing of when you\u2019ll with that contract?", "D. Scott Davis", "Well, we said we\u2019d have it done before the end of the year. We would like to get it done as soon as possible and hopefully get some volume in the network late in 2008, and the goal is to have it totally implemented by the middle, latter part of 2009. ", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Research  ", "Is that a push-back from what you had said earlier?", "D. Scott Davis", "No, same dates. I think the team is making great progress. I think we said all along that we hoped that we\u2019d have the contract done in 2008. The teams are working very hard to get it done as soon as possible. ", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Research  ", "Thanks for the time. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from William Green of Morgan Stanley.", "William Green - Morgan Stanley  ", "Just to ask about the way you could maybe address some big network changes if the freight flows change, would you ever reconsider now maybe upping the DIM weights on the grounds from what you\u2019ve currently got?", "D. Scott Davis", "Upping the DIM weight meaning taking larger packages?", "William Green - Morgan Stanley  ", "Meaning changing the -- basically making it as you charge for air, where it\u2019s all DIM weight as opposed to actual weight. ", "D. Scott Davis", "Well, certainly we look at all options, Bill, but the on-the-ground, the cubic size is not as big a driver of total cost of the product as it is in air, so with our current DIM weight, we really look for the outsized packages that are over three cubic feet, and those are the ones that we make sure we\u2019re charging appropriately. So it\u2019s not something at this present time that we are evaluating but we\u2019ll continue to look at revenue management opportunities and clearly our basic strategy in our pricing is to make sure that we price appropriately to reflect costs, so that\u2019s always an option. ", "William Green - Morgan Stanley  ", "Okay, and then as you look at the changes that fuel is forcing on your customers, where is the weakness most pronounced? Is it sort of B2B that you are seeing it? Can you parse it out from the economy? Is it B2C? Where\u2019s the big change?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I think proportionally it\u2019s similar in both segments. B2C continues to have better performance than does B2B, but it is sequentially over the last three, four quarters, it has seen actually a greater slowing than the commercial side, so it\u2019s -- that\u2019s the -- you know, the consumer clearly is in question right now and we\u2019re watching those trends very carefully, both for our big retail companies that we\u2019re delivering to and then the end consumer business. ", "D. Scott Davis", "Long-term, I think that if you think about B2C, it really is much more efficient to have UPS delivering a package to your host than it is for you to go to the mall and buy that package, so I think that even high energy prices will probably drive B2C business over the long-term and benefit the consumer. ", "William Green - Morgan Stanley  ", "Just lastly, what\u2019s your average domestic parcel [inaudible]?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I don\u2019t believe we disclose that distance. ", "William Green - Morgan Stanley  ", "All right. Thanks for your help. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. You talked about changes, or I guess the high fixed structure of the international. What kind of changes to that network do you envision that you can make to maybe make it more variable in nature?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Clearly that\u2019s an area of very high focus for us. We saw fairly substantial changes over the course of the quarter, and as you know, we\u2019ve had an incredible run over the last five, six years on the international side, but we did see some slowing from April to May to June, frankly, that caught us a little off guard. ", "One of the core issues around international is the big worldwide services where we have the major flights going across the oceans. That is a more fixed cost, unless we choose to take a substantial step down in capacity. Frankly, if flows between the continents continue to slow, then we will be looking very critically at perhaps reducing temporarily some selected flights between the continents, and that assessment is underway right now, looking at how we can take some cost out. ", "We continue to see though very strong growth intra-region, and both Asia and Europe showed high-single-digit to low-double-digit shipments within the regions, and so in the short-term, we are seeing some of that regional trade flourish even as the worldwide trade is slowing. ", "So some of these things are recalibrating our network, some is perhaps taking out capacity. Also in the international, we don\u2019t have quite the same variable structure as we do in the U.S. on the ground. Labor laws and the nature of our employee contracts are different by country and some we actually pay monthly salaries to our employees, rather than the typical hourly rates that we use in the U.S., where we can adjust on a daily basis. ", "So it\u2019s a large business with very many different moving parts, but we\u2019re on high alert right now and all of the regions are looking at local plans and global plans, or how to stay ahead of the curve. ", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great, and then you made another comment earlier, Kurt. You said that -- it actually was also in the release -- that you are going to seen an improvement in the second half of results and obviously your targets indicate that with your second half EPS targets. I\u2019m just wondering, is that kind of just mostly on the fuel catch-up, on the surcharge? And if so, what does the -- you know, you keep highlighting the move from $100 to $140. What does the move back down to $130, is that significant at all in helping with that catch-up and does that maybe even further enhance your second half target?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "There are some company-specific issues, Ken, that we have been talking about and we\u2019re confident will begin to provide us a little more of a tailwind, starting in the second quarter. Certainly the new labor agreement we have with the teamsters is one that we feel will be favorable to us, basically in any economic climate. The inflation of wages will moderate substantially. The increases are split into two tranches, one each sixth month, so our effective increase in August will be substantially less than it was in the previous year. ", "We had some more favorable language regarding eligibility for healthcare for our part-timers, still giving the best benefits in the industry for those part-timers that stay with us a year or more, but not necessarily giving eligibility after 60 days or 90 days. ", "So there are a number of specific issues there. Also, certainly the assumption we have is that fuel will stabilize, I guess. We\u2019re not counting on a precipitous decline, so at least that big headwind that frankly put us on our heels a bit in the second quarter will moderate. ", "And then we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives on the international to make sure we are reacting appropriately. And then last but certainly not least, we\u2019re seeing great results in the supply chain in freight unit. The LTL environment does seem to be stabilizing a bit and clearly UPS freight should be able to benefit from that. ", "D. Scott Davis", "This outlook is really based on crude oil right around $140 a barrel, so if it goes up, that hurts us; if it goes down, that helps us some.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks so much for the time. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Justin Yagerman of Wachovia Capital.", "Justin Yagerman - Wachovia ", "I guess my first question is related to the international side. I was curious -- you guys mentioned that you saw strength intra-regionally international. I was curious if you could quantify around whether or not you thought that was more market share growth and company-specific driven, or -- because we\u2019ve begun to hear reports that Western Europe has slowed a little bit from some of the heavier industrial companies that have reported. ", "And then on the export growth side, you had mentioned in the release that you saw slowing throughout the quarter and I wanted to get some color on that; maybe you could detail the growth month by month in the second quarter. ", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "First off, Justin, on the market share gain, we\u2019ve been gaining market share in the international segment for 10 years now and we\u2019re pretty confident we continue to have a superior business model with the integrated network and the broad range of offerings in every geography. But we did see some of  those trends that you\u2019ve seen externally, and there was a significant slowing from April to May to June, really with June being the weaker, in most of the regions and so certainly Europe was a part of that. Europe had a strong April but partially because of the Easter distortion. But we have seen some slowing. ", "The nice thing about our portfolio though is that we are continuing to see this regional trade pattern in Europe moving forward and as fuel prices get high, our sense is that European companies are looking to Eastern Europe rather than the Far East perhaps a little more, and so that helps to offset things. ", "Justin Yagerman - Wachovia ", "Okay, and I noticed in the freight division that the weight per shipment at LTL was down. Many of your competitors in their early kind of notes on the quarter have mentioned that they are seeing an opposite trend, and I was curious what you\u2019d attribute the lower weight per shipment to. Is that increased leveraging across the small package network and the freight networks, as you get more -- as the labor is more organized within the freight division? How are you guys viewing that trend within your freight business?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I wouldn\u2019t put too sharp a point on it. It\u2019s five pounds for a thousand-pound average shipment, so -- no, I think the good news is that the weight per shipment has stabilized and that\u2019s a good sign economically. And clearly our value proposition is working well and we are continuing to target medium-sized shippers and large shippers also. But I think the weight stabilizing is good news and the other companies are validating that also. What we are seeing great results on though is our continued success in our yield management and our revenue per hundred weight, so that\u2019s more of a priority for us than focusing solely on the weight per shipment. ", "Justin Yagerman - Wachovia ", "Got it. All right, thanks so much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Garrett Chase of Lehman Brothers.", "Analyst for Garrett Chase - Lehman Brothers  ", "Good morning. This is actually Brandon [Oblanksy]. Not to belabor the point on international, but you guys had mentioned that you are looking at intra-region growth as continuing but global lanes are slowing a little bit more than anticipated. How should we think about the profitability impact of this going forward?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Certainly both flows have good margins but from an economic perspective, at least in the short-term, the worldwide flows have a much higher proportion of fixed costs. Volume was negative come into the U.S. from all regions but frankly, we weren\u2019t able to take down any of those big jets coming in from those regions. So in the short-term, the ship is a headwind for us because there is less variable costs in those worldwide products. And on the flip side, on the regional, intra-regional, we do have more options. It is more variable and so it behaves more like a typical U.S. shipment would, where we can adjust pretty well and adapt. ", "So it\u2019s the process of adaptation to these things and as those trends continue, it will mean we will have less lift going across oceans and more lift moving across the continent, and that\u2019s some of the long-term issues that Scott spoke to. ", "D. Scott Davis", "We\u2019ll end up the year with still mid-teens margins international, which is obviously the best of any of the competitors. Not as high as we\u2019d like them to be but certainly solid margins. ", "Analyst for Garrett Chase - Lehman Brothers  ", "Okay, and if you do decide to take down some of this global and intercontinental capacity, is that going to place further pressure on the domestic network? Because I\u2019m sure that some of the export products are actually moving through the U.S. network, so does that place a little bit more pressure on the flexibility of the domestic network?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "We\u2019re going to put up lift for any packages that want to come into the U.S. or anywhere else, so we will match capacity to demand. We\u2019re not going to truncate demand with capacity reductions. ", "D. Scott Davis", "What you end up doing if you took planes down internationally, you\u2019d probably move those to the U.S. and then retire older classic aircraft in this situation. ", "Analyst for Garrett Chase - Lehman Brothers  ", "Okay. Thanks a lot, gentlemen. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Robin Byde of HSBC.", "Robin Byde - HSBC Securities  ", "Good morning, everybody. Just two questions, if that\u2019s okay; on the European business, now that [inaudible], what are the next priorities in expanding the European network? And just [on the commission structure], you [won\u2019t see] [inaudible] in the market again as consolidation of the sector, so can you just update us on UPS' strategy on acquisitions? Thank you. ", "D. Scott Davis", "Our strategy in acquisitions has not changed, I think, than what we\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of years. What I\u2019ve said in the past is clearly we\u2019re not going to do anything domestically in the package business, but supply chain and freight, we\u2019ve said we wanted to have a couple of years of good execution and improving margins. We\u2019re seeing that, we\u2019re seeing some good progress there. The one area that we\u2019d be most interested in still is international package, areas that make sense and that\u2019s been the case for the last several years. Certainly Asia and Europe are areas that we are interested in, particularly Central and Eastern Europe. ", "Robin Byde - HSBC Securities  ", "Thank you. And just on Europe?", "D. Scott Davis", "Robin, your first question wasn\u2019t really clear. The connection wasn\u2019t really clear. Could you repeat it?", "Robin Byde - HSBC Securities  ", "Yes, sure, sorry about that. I was just asking you now that the [inaudible] integrated, what are your next priorities in expanding the European network? I guess from what you are saying, more expansion in Eastern Europe. ", "D. Scott Davis", "Right, yeah, sorry, I didn\u2019t pick up the Tamworth. The Tamworth is a very large ground hub that allows us to complete the operational integration of the acquisition we did of Link several years ago, and it was a big step and actually created somewhat of an operational challenge for us in the second half. But we now have the ability to have one inter-lined operation. We\u2019ve aligned the customer portfolio and so that really is the capstone on our U.K.  acquisition and we\u2019ll be harvesting the benefits of that going forward. ", "We\u2019re continuing to benefit from the acquisition we did in Poland. That\u2019s been a great one for us and strengthens our position and clearly we would like to continue to strengthen the Central and Eastern Europe theaters, certainly because of their increased focus on regional trade, so that\u2019s an area that we are investing in and we will certainly continue to do organic expansions with capacity. We expanded our Cologne airport just a year ago and we\u2019ll keep looking for organic opportunities and certainly selective operations. Acquisition is not off the table either, so a combined strategy of both organic growth, which has served us well in Europe, and then keeping eyes open for opportunities. ", "Robin Byde - HSBC Securities  ", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Larkin of Stifel Nicolaus.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Good morning, gentlemen. I just had a question on the two month delay in the fuel surcharge. Is there any kind of structural impediment that prevents you from tightening that down a little bit so that you are doing a better job of matching the surcharge with the actual underlying fuel price? And as a corollary to that, is there any kind of a delayed effect here because the big fuel prices really aren\u2019t probably kicking in until right about now. Are you fearful that there could be an acceleration of the trade-down from premium products here during the months of say July and August?", "D. Scott Davis", "I think when we set up this index, I think we wanted to be fair to our customers, give them advance notice of what the rates would be. We\u2019re going through an unusual phenomena right now where oil has gone in one direction. It will not go up forever and when it comes down, we\u2019ll get equalized. So I think the right thing to do for our customers is to give them that 45-day notice of when the surcharges will be. ", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "And we continue to do some limited hedging activity, but frankly it\u2019s not within the bounds of the kind of moves we\u2019ve seen, so to minimize the volatility. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Just maybe one follow-on here regarding the international business; have you seen much of a trade-down from air to ocean, and if so, have you been able to capture some of the ocean movements through your forwarding operation? And if so, can you give us a sense for the relative profitability of that business?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, we\u2019ve not seen huge shift. I mean, clearly we\u2019re working with a lot of customers as we evaluate supply chains, and Scott referenced that too. But actually ocean seems to be struggling perhaps more. I know the recent data showed a 6% decline in ocean. That\u2019s not company-specific but some external numbers into the U.S. So I think all modes right now are struggling and really the big message is the U.S. engine that drives the substantial amount of imports into the U.S. is slowing right now, and so all of the theaters are seeing some sequential headwinds. ", "D. Scott Davis", "I think we would expect more ocean freight growth with the fuel prices but the market data, you\u2019re not seeing it. You\u2019re seeing negative -- certainly in June the market data showed negative growth. ", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Within our air freight portfolio, we are seeing more rapid growth in the deferred and porting products as compared to the express freight, so that easy choice we\u2019re giving customers to move from the guaranteed express service down to deferred forwarding, we are seeing that flex back and forth, so it\u2019s just another example of our keep it in the portfolio strategy that we\u2019ve been building towards. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Thank you. That\u2019s great color. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Campbell of Thompson Davis.", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis", "Good morning, everyone. Some of your competitors have mentioned an improving price control, or have been improving revenue trends in June in the licensed truckload and trucking business. That is the capacity to improve pricing better than in previous months. Did you see the same thing and what does that tell you, if anything, about the economic growth?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I think we really have not seen the headwinds on pricing, David. That\u2019s been one of the real positives with our new value proposition, with the guarantee we launched in January, with the deep integration to our World Ship application for generating freight shipments. Yield has not been a challenge for us. We feel pretty comfortable with our yields. ", "What we have seen though, I guess to support the market anecdotes, is a firming of demand and also a stabilizing of weight per shipment, which are both good leading indicators, we think. ", "D. Scott Davis", "David, looking at the economy, we think that the second quarter GDP is probably going to be the best GDP of the year, helped obviously by the rebate checks. I think that number will be a bigger number than most people expect. But as we move ahead throughout the year, we still -- [we\u2019re not the] leading indicators but certainly what you read and what you see, we expect probably slightly positive growth in the economy but still anemic. Really the important barometer we follow is manufacturing IP. Manufacturing IP was negative in the first half of the year, slightly negative and expected to be slightly negative for the year. So it\u2019s not going to get a lot worse but [it will get a lot better] for the rest of this year. ", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis", "And the decrease in export yields in the second quarter after increasing in the first quarter, can you explain that, please?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, export yields have been fairly steady, both on a pre-currency and a post-currency basis. We\u2019ve seen steady domestic increases and the overall export yields have been flat to slightly negative, and that\u2019s primarily mix issue that we\u2019ve talked about for a number of quarters, with the trans-border services growing faster than the worldwide services.  So trends are fairly stable there. ", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Art Hatfield of Morgan Keegan.", "Arthur Hatfield - Morgan Keegan", "Most of my questions have been answered but Scott and Kurt, you\u2019ve alluded to the fact that if things don\u2019t change and if say fuel is at these higher levels permanently, you are going to have to make structural changes. I know this is kind of a hypothetical, but do you have in your mind kind of a period of time that you look at to say if fuel is at this sustained level for say six months or a year, there\u2019s kind of an inflection point in time where you decide you have to make major structural changes to the network?", "D. Scott Davis", "I think, Art, this is a long-term phenomena. I think it\u2019s an evolutionary process and we\u2019ve done a lot of scenario planning on this topic and I think it\u2019s something that if companies decide they want to start building goods closer to the end consumer, it\u2019s going to happen over many, many years. It won\u2019t happen overnight. It\u2019s a big shift for businesses, so you may see a slow movement to near sourcing but it won\u2019t happen very quickly. ", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "And we don\u2019t want to put too much emphasis on it. I mean, it\u2019s prudent for us to stay in the future and think about the trends. We thought it was appropriate to share some of our thinking to let you know that we are long-term players in this industry and we are going to stay ahead of the curve. But as Scott said, these are evolutionary issues and we don\u2019t expect any rapid changes, even if fuel stays high. ", "Arthur Hatfield - Morgan Keegan", "Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s very, very helpful. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from John [Mins] of BB&T Capital Markets.", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets  ", "Good morning. I\u2019m standing in for John Barnes. Looking at CapEx going forward, if these current conditions persist, could you all reach a point where you put some of the larger CapEx projects on hold?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "We continue to evaluate CapEx in an ongoing fashion and frankly we tightened it up prior to giving our guidance for 2008, so we will be right at $3 billion, which is below our 6% of revenue threshold that is typical. But we\u2019ve got a couple of major investments right now that are full speed ahead. We\u2019re expanding our World Port hub. That will continue to pay dividends that allows us to optimize the air network, it allows us to sort faster and fly slower, which saves air fuel, fuel for our aircraft. And should our contract with DHL be completed, having that extra sort capacity in World Port is absolutely essential. ", "So domestically, there are investments we are making and those will wrap up in the next year, year-and-a-half or so that we\u2019ll continue. And then globally, certainly we\u2019ll adjust air fees appropriately but we are continuing to build capacity. China is a very busy place for us right now. Scott gave you an extended tour of all of the Olympics activities but behind the scene also is a substantial amount of increase in our geographic coverage, browning up the country, if you would, and building an infrastructure there. ", "So a lot of work going on. We do have a lot of control over CapEx. We had some committed aircraft in the future but it\u2019s a modest amount and frankly as 2012 comes around and some of the aging aircraft directives come in, it will be a natural transition for us to replace our DC8s with 767s. So we feel real good about where we\u2019re at from a CapEx perspective and we\u2019ll be reacting, but not -- we don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s going to hamper our capabilities at all. ", "D. Scott Davis", "We\u2019ll continue to make the right decisions for the long-term for this company but rest easy that we are vigilant about invested capital, we are focused on economic profits, so we\u2019ll only do CapEx when it makes an awful lot of sense for the company. ", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets  ", "I appreciate the time. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Matthew Troy of Citigroup.", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "Thanks. [inaudible] an earlier question, I was wondering, the economic assumptions underlying your outlook -- I understand the value of your network visibility is a coincidental economic indicator and some forward-looking capability, given delivery stocking and sell-through of what you are actually moving through your customers. But looking at the dashboard of your outlook, you mentioned IP. What are the other key metrics you evaluate in determining your broader outlook? To what extent does -- ", "D. Scott Davis", "Certainly IP is probably the best barometer but clearly retail sales I think combined with IP are the two that we\u2019ll look at closest as we move forward. And again, the outlook that we see as we move through the rest of 2008 is the retail sales got a bump in the second quarter with the rebates. They will moderate. They are still growing below inflation levels at this point in time. Manufacturing IP is going to be flat to slightly negative, so we really are -- our economic assumptions for the rest of this year are just real slight growth in the U.S. economy. ", "", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "What extent does that economic outlook incorporate customer dialog? And really, what is the visibility you\u2019ve got? Is it two months, is it three months out? I\u2019m just trying to get a good sense of how we should weight your economic read relative to some commentary we\u2019re hearing at some other industries. ", "D. Scott Davis", "Well, the macroeconomic really comes from consensus estimates out there but we talk to our customers all the time and get a feel for where their business is going, particularly as we head into peak season. We have to plan our peak season months and months in advance, so we talk to an awful lot of our shippers and get an idea of what they see as inventory stocking levels. So it\u2019s a combination of the macroeconomic data available and certainly talking to our customers. And I think the feedback we are getting from our customers today is somewhat consistent with our macroeconomic outlook -- it\u2019s going to be anemic growth; growth, but anemic growth. ", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "A follow-up question; in times like this in the service-based industry, customers often lean on their suppliers, if not on price than for greater value or more service. Are you seeing -- you talked about the trade-down from premium that\u2019s occurred, in addition to some lower traffic levels. Are customers asking you to do more for them, whether to commit your assets as rolling warehouses or put your balance sheet to work on their behalf? Is there something that you see at the margin that customers are asking you to do that might have been different than 12 months ago? Thanks. ", "D. Scott Davis", "Yeah, they\u2019re asking us to do more for them but I think what it is is they want us to help them adapt. And so although there is certainly cost pressures, we\u2019ve got a number of just great anecdotes where we\u2019re working with companies to realign their distribution as the balance of transportation cost and distribution expenses changed. So it\u2019s a very busy time for our customer solutions group, working with customers to partner and help them figure out how to manage. And in some cases, we cannibalize revenue and in other cases, we grow revenue substantially by broadening the relationship. ", "So it\u2019s a very busy time but frankly an exciting one for our sales and solutions people. ", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Wadewitz of J.P. Morgan.", "Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "I just have one follow-up question; I know that it\u2019s a ways out from 2009 but if you look at the prior downturn, Scott, I think you had talked about air volumes being down a bit either in \u201901/02 or \u201802/03, and it seems like you don\u2019t necessarily get a quick recovery the second year after, or the first year after a downturn. Is it reasonable to think that margins could be up in \u201909 if volumes are kind of flat to slightly up, given the teamster contract, given DHL? Or do you really need to see more meaningful volume growth in 2009 to get margins moving in the right directions?", "D. Scott Davis", "We think with not a lot of growth, we\u2019re still going to see a better 2009 than 2008. We\u2019re optimistic about the outlook. We\u2019ve done a lot of good things with the company, including the contract, which will benefit us, including the potential DHL contract, which we hope to have signed here soon. That\u2019s going to help us in 2009. ", "We feel good about the outlook. We think that the business is solid in all areas. Comparisons obviously get a little easier after 2008, so we\u2019re obviously optimistic about \u201909 at this point in time. ", "Clearly growth helps us. If we see the volume grow, it lowers our effective weight rate increases and that\u2019s also helpful. Right now, we\u2019re seeing certainly the effective weight rate increases, you know, [similar] to the contract increases through the July 31st period. Now into August, that will be less painful, as the rate goes down, as the rate increase goes down. ", "But I think that we can show improving margins. We\u2019ve had a lot of volume growth, certainly volume growth would help us in effective [inaudible]. ", "Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your final question is coming from Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Research.", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Research  ", "Just a follow-up to the question I asked before on the timing of the DHL contract; when you had announced it and DHL announced it, you talked about $1 billion of potential annual revenue. I was under the impression that was for 2009. Is that still the thought process?", "D. Scott Davis", "Well, the discussion, you know, with the contract still being negotiated and [it\u2019s been sent] on their levels of business as we [get into it], so we\u2019re not -- until we really sign the contract, we can\u2019t really determine that number clearly but we were looking at full year, first full year would be 2010, I guess. We\u2019ll have it fully implemented, we hope, by the second half of 2009, so the first full year will be 2010 and we\u2019re talking about those type of levels ", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Ed, we said we\u2019d be at a full burn rate during -- after the ramp up in \u201909 but we did not suggest it was the full revenue for \u201909. ", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Research  ", "Okay, and so the first full peak season when you would be doing this would be \u201909 though?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yeah, that\u2019s correct. ", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Research  ", "Okay, thanks, guys. ", "D. Scott Davis", "I guess I\u2019ll leave you with two points; first, we expect full-year earnings per share to be within a range of $3.50 to $3.70; and then second, while adapting to the current environment, we are still investing to expand our global presence, ensuring we maintain our leadership role in the industry.

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relation third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations; sir you may begin. ", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I\u2019m here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company\u2019s results and our future expectations. But before we begin, I\u2019ll review the Safe Harbor language. ", "Some of the comments we\u2019ll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2007 10-K and 2008 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. ", "In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will discuss comparisons between the third quarters of 2008 and 2007 excluding the effect of the restructuring charge that occurred last year. We believe that these results more accurately reflect UPS\u2019s true performance last year.", "The adjustment stems from a $46 million restructuring charge and related expenses for supply chain business in France which equated to about $0.03 per diluted share. A reconciliation of these results is included with our earnings announcement this morning and appears on UPS\u2019s IR website in the Financial Information tab.", "Now to begin our review, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Scott. ", "Scott Davis ", "Thanks Andy and good morning everyone. As everyone knows the third quarter turned out to be one of the most challenging that the world\u2019s financial markets have seen in a long time. I\u2019m pleased to say that UPS performed well despite the difficult environment. ", "At the present time we have a continuation of the same story. Consensus GDP and IP growth keep getting lowered. Economic recovery gets pushed out farther into 2009 even possibly into 2010 and indicators continue to reflect the slowing global economic activity.", "Expectations are that the next few quarters will be challenging. Industrial production was negative in the third quarter and is now expected to be negative for the year. As we said many times in the past industrial production is one of the best barometers for our US domestic package business. ", "Retail sales growth has also slowed and is expected to remain weak. Forecasters anticipate that consumer spending will be worse then the current slowdown then in the prior two downturns. I know this sounds somewhat somber, but despite these challenges there is much within UPS to be pleased about. ", "Our international export volume growth decreased 7% per day significantly more then the market. The performance of our supply chain unit continued the momentum we have seen all year with operating profit up over 30%.", "We managed our domestic package operations well in response to lower then anticipated volumes but service levels at all time highs. Once again, the company posted industry leading operating profit and margins and generated substantially increased free cash flow.", "And finally UPS\u2019s strong balance sheet ensured we had ready access to commercial paper at very favorable rates. ", "All in all, UPS around the world performed well in today\u2019s difficult business environment. We were benefiting from our extensive global presence and expanded product portfolio. In fact, 40% of revenue this quarter came from the international and supply chain of freight segments. ", "This compares to only 25% in 2003. Let me switch gears now and touch on a topic I know all of you are interested in, our airlift contract with DHL. ", "We are still in negotiations with them on this contract and hope to conclude an agreement before the end of the year. That said, we have not stopped competing with them. We will continue to do so as we do with all competitors and we made that clear from the start of the negotiations.", "Now, I want to recognize some recent achievements. UPSers did a magnificent job responding to the destruction caused by recent hurricanes. In spite of the personal challenges they faced our people had small package and freight operations up and running within days of each storm.", "That was no small accomplishment. UPS contributed over $1 million in monetary and in-kind disaster relief for Gulf Coast residents. In addition we\u2019re actively involved in Haiti, supporting Care International, deploying logistics experts to work with the world food program there, and providing supplies to make clean water available for over five million people.", "Another group of UPSers deserving recognition is our logistics team responsible for the behind the scene support of the Olympic games of China. Several thousand UPSers literally delivered the games moving 19 million items including everything from kayaks to canoes to the 2000 drums you all saw in the opening ceremonies.", "I congratulate them for their dedication, organization, and flawless execution. ", "Lastly I want to remind you that UPS published our sixth annual corporate sustainability report in the quarter. We were the first in our industry to produce such a report and then annually benchmarked progress against long-term goals. ", "Before I turn the program over to Kurt, I want to reiterate my firm belief that adverse times test the mettle of an organization and that good companies can emerge better and stronger for having had that test. ", "I\u2019m confident that UPS\u2019s mettle is resilient, flexible, and adaptable. UPS is and will remain a financially sound and well-run business. ", "Now for details on the quarter and our thoughts on the future, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kurt.", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. Against the backdrop of economic slowing and financial turmoil UPS performed well in the third quarter. Revenue was up a healthy 7.4% and earnings per share came in at $0.96. ", "We made good progress on our cost initiatives but there were more then offset by economic deceleration and the high cost of fuel which drove product mix changes. In fact fuel expense was up 65% compared with a year ago driven by higher prices. ", "However since average fuel prices declined rapidly throughout the quarter the two-month lag in the fuel surcharge did provide a benefit of about $90 million for the US domestic operations. ", "Three months ago we told you that we anticipated the US small package market would contract about 2% in the second half of the year. However economic conditions worsened more then expected and our results reflect that.", "We saw volume declines across our entire domestic portfolio. July and August volume continued second quarter trends but in September we saw precipitous declines. Most notable were the next day products where letter volume declined more then package volume, largely due to significant softness in the services sector.", "Revenue per piece increased 5.8% led by next day air at 11%. Gains were due to focused revenue management efforts in both the air and ground products and to the impact of higher fuel surcharges. These were offset somewhat by lower weights and less favorable mix characteristics. ", "New lighter weight competitive wins in our deferred product constrained revenue per piece improvement. We believe the pricing environment continues to be rational. Domestic operating margin was down 200 points although we still generated an industry-leading margin of 14.2%.", "In the quarter we implemented a number of cost control initiatives. While absolute costs are up year-over-year due to higher fuel expense, wage and benefit expense moderated as a result of our success in adapting our network to lower volume levels. ", "For example operating hours were down 3.4%, same as package volume. Miles were also reduced about 3%. The benefit of the new labor contract however was mitigated somewhat by the reduction in volumes.", "We also made adjustments to our air network, [lock] hours were reduced without degrading service. In fact throughout the company service levels were at an all time high. Even though cost control is particularly important today we will not sacrifice investment for the future.", "As part of our constant effort to enhance the product portfolio UPS improved air package pick up service for more then a quarter of all US businesses. The enhancements provide more flexibility to meet critical deadlines for customers who do not have a daily scheduled pick up. ", "Now to our international business, this segment posted solid results despite global economic challenges illustrating the competitive advantage of our integrated global operations. Average daily export volume increased 7%, well beyond market growth rates. ", "This is due in part to our broad global offering and the technology tools we\u2019ve developed to simplify international shipping, like paperless invoice and international returns. All regions of the world experienced mid to high single-digit growth.", "US import volume growth from all regions of the world did remain negative however, but non-US lanes were strong. Transporter volume within Europe for example was up 10% and Asia to Europe increased over 15%.", "Although revenue per piece increased more then 11% operating results were negatively impacted by mix change particularly in Europe and by the decline in US imports. Nevertheless just as in our US operations this segment generates the industry\u2019s best operating margin. ", "And remember this 13.1% operating margin reflects the traditional slowing in Europe in the summer. Across the globe we continue investing to support future growth opportunities. In the fourth quarter UPS will open its new hub in Shanghai, which will link all of China to UPS\u2019s international network. ", "And tomorrow we will break ground on our new intra Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China. This hub will reduce transit time for almost 200 city [payers] in Asia and it will play an important role in facilitating robust intra Asia trading activity. ", "Let\u2019s turn now to the supply chain and freight segment, which continued to demonstrate the positive momentum we\u2019ve seen in previous quarters this year. Revenue increased 9% and profitability improved over 30%. ", "Operating margin of 5.6% was inline with our target for the year. International and North American airfreight drove significant profitability improvements. The expanded airfreight service portfolio that we introduced early in the year continues to attract new customers.", "UPS freight posted 7.8% LTO revenue improvement but tonnage was flat and shipments declined reflecting the tough economic conditions and a more competitive pricing environment. Productivity and service metrics continued to improve and see are attracting and retaining customers with our world ship and quantum view managed technologies.", "Earlier this month UPS freight announced the third round of network enhancements this year. Time and transit improvements have been made to over 12,000 lanes in the past 18 months offering faster service for two-thirds of all US zip codes.", "These enhancements are part of a continual process to add value for customers by improving the velocity of our network. ", "Before I talk about the fourth quarter I do want to comment on our solid financial position. For the first nine months of this year, UPS generated approximately $7 billion in cash from operations. With that we invested $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, spent $3.3 billion to repurchase 48.5 million shares, paid dividends of $1.8 billion, and still ended the nine months with $1.8 billion in cash and investments.", "Through the end of the third quarter free cash flow reached $4.6 billion reflecting the strength of our business model. This does include approximately $1 billion in US federal tax refunds related to the company\u2019s withdrawal from the central states pension plan. ", "As a point of comparison a year ago free cash flow was $3.1 billion. UPS also continues to experience ample liquidity in the commercial paper market at very favorable rates. In these turbulent times investors exhibit a flight to quality mentality and our strong balance sheet is very attractive. ", "In addition we had bank credit lines well in excess of our outstanding commercial paper. We did see a $23 million reduction in this quarter\u2019s investment income due to an impairment on certain auction rate securities, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. ", "In the quarter we spent over $800 million to repurchase almost 13 million shares. This was a somewhat slower pace then in the first half of the year. As credit markets became chaotic we though it prudent to pull back a bit. ", "We intend to continue repurchasing shares but the pace will depend on market conditions which we\u2019ll continue to monitor. ", "We\u2019ve also reduced our 2008 capital expenditure budget by $200 million to $2.8 billion. All in all UPS\u2019s financial position remains very strong and we intend to preserve our ability to maneuver and to take advantage of whatever opportunities we may identify. ", "Now for the fourth quarter, with consumer confidence approaching new lows we\u2019re concerned that Santa\u2019s sleigh may be a bit lighter then usual this year. We expect domestic volumes to be down about 4% for the quarter reflecting the economic slowing. ", "We intend to execute an effective and efficient peak operating plan diligently matching the network to volume levels. Given current economic conditions we believe it will be several more quarters before any turnaround will become evident. ", "In the international arena several European economies are on the brink of recession and most of Asia\u2019s economies are expected to grow at a slower rate then in the past. With the strengthening dollar and US trading partners experiencing weaker economies US export growth is also expected to slow.", "Nonetheless we expect export volume growth should increase by approximately 5% with a mid teen operating margin for the segment. In the global small package operations yield growth will moderate due to a substantial decline in fuel surcharge revenues. ", "However we anticipate base pricing to remain firm. The supply chain and freight segment should continue the growth trends we\u2019ve seen all year. Operating margin in this segment is expected to be at or above 5% for the full year constrained somewhat by the tough conditions in the LTL freight business.", "And lastly earnings per share for the year should be towards the lower end of the $3.50 to $3.70 range that we provided midyear. ", "You know its no secret that 2009 will be challenging. We intend to pursue long-term growth opportunities and be opportunistic in extracting growth in today\u2019s tough environment. In addition", " UPS will implement a wide range of cost initiatives in both the US and abroad to match our business to volume levels. ", "This will include network modifications, lower capital expenditures, and reductions in staffing levels. UPS has a long history of managing through all kinds of economic scenarios. We\u2019re confident in our business model and in our ability to adapt it to match market conditions, both good and bad. ", "We will invest for the future while managing conservatively through the near-term. Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Garrett Chase \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital ", "Garrett Chase \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital ", "If you take literally what you said about the trends progression through the quarter in terms of what happened in September on the volume side, sounds like September was a pretty bad month, probably down double-digit in air, and mid single-digits in ground, is that the case and it feels like the fourth quarter guidance on the domestic volume while its not good, it certainly looks good relative to what that September comment would suggest, can you give a little color there?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "If you look at what we said on our last earnings call, May and June both were fairly sluggish and we saw those two months down a couple of percent, that trend basically continued through July and August and then in September that rate of decline more then doubled and so we did see slower trends especially starting the second and third week of September. ", "And basically that pace has continued through October so far. The good news is we do see some stability in that but the bad news is it does generate then our best guess of volume growth of 4% for the fourth quarter. Clearly the fourth quarter will be heavily dependent on the Christmas holiday and it anybody\u2019s guess exactly how that comes out, although frankly we do think that people will be conservative this year. ", "Garrett Chase \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital ", "I understand there\u2019s a lag, but the fuel surcharge component is going to come down dramatically as I think you mentioned, what kind of impact do you think that\u2019s going to have? Do you think you\u2019ve seen more of the volume weakness already because the surcharges were so high? ", "Kurt Kuehn ", "We\u2019ll certainly the surcharge had a dramatic effect on shipping behavior. We do know that it did cause additional pressure on our premium products and the significant amount of trade down into the deferred and the ground products. ", "Right now at least fuel has come down dramatically and we\u2019ll see where it goes from here but if the conditions continue we\u2019re hopeful that there\u2019ll be some benefit both on the premium products picking up a little more and also we\u2019ll get some benefit in the fourth quarter from the two-month lag. ", "Scott Davis ", "We built our guidance for the oil to be in the mid 80\u2019s, so there\u2019s maybe a little bit of an upside there. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird ", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird ", "When you look at the domestic express margin and even if I back out the $90 million of fuel it looks like you\u2019ve made some progress there in the year, how much of that is related to the teamsters contract going in on August 1 and how much of that is related to your ongoing efforts to control costs?", "Kurt Kuehn  ", "The majority really is our cost initiatives. We have moved pretty quickly to adjust the network to [print] out discretionary spending and just make sure we right size and let our people know that at least at this point we don\u2019t anticipate much change to the better.", "The labor contract certainly has some favorable attributes but the effect of that was muted because of the very low growth, we really aren\u2019t bringing as many new employees and you get a magnifying effect as you do that. ", "Scott Davis ", "We\u2019ve always said that we should built a right to these [inaudible] better then most, we said that half of our costs are directly variable and you really saw that in the third quarter where our volumes were down 3.4% and hours were down 3.4%, block hours were down in areas. We do a pretty good job managing to the downturns. ", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird ", "The margin for the fourth quarter in domestic, you\u2019re just summing all your pieces together it seems like you\u2019re looking at a low double-digit operating margin on the domestic side to get your guidance range, is that true even inclusive of the fact that your fuel benefit assuming fuel stays where its at today, is probably double what it was in the third quarter for domestic?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "We do have an estimate of fuel in there that\u2019s a little above where prices are at today so there\u2019s certainly some potential there. But frankly with negative 4% volumes this is a challenging quarter. The holidays are always an exciting time for us, you really have to forecast and commit assets and resources far ahead of time. So there is more exposure certainly during December to volume changes then in most times of the year. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research ", "On the DHL contract, you said you\u2019re still hopeful of closing it, do you have a bit more insight, it seems like they\u2019ve hemorrhaged a lot of business and you certainly won your fair share of that recently, do you think its still a billion a year or is that number going to be a lot smaller should the line haul agreement occur?", "Scott Davis ", "The negotiations are continuing. We hope to reach an agreement before the end of the year, but realistically the scope and size of the deal may be changed based on the customers\u2019 reactions to their announced restructuring and downsizing in the US. On top of that weakening economies are going to have an impact on them as it does everybody. I think its fair to say that we\u2019re still negotiating but the scope and the size of that deal could change. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research ", "Is there a time period where if its not done by this time, its kind of too late from that perspective?", "Scott Davis ", "I think its something that we\u2019ve got to look at from our perspective and they have to look at from their perspective. Both parties are negotiating in good faith at this point in time but I think sooner is better then later.", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research ", "On the share repurchase now that the stock is sitting here with a [for] handle in front of it, its quite accretive to go in there and I understand the credit markets aren\u2019t great, but you\u2019re certainly not having a lot of trouble with accessing capital, how do we think about those two conflicting things as we go forward in the near-term, the stock down here and the markets in terms of your guidance of $5 billion a year of share repurchase?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "This really has been an unprecedented time for turbulence in the debt markets especially and we\u2019ve been fortunate in that we\u2019ve really had as much access to commercial paper as we need and at very, very beneficial rates so the liquidity is there. On the other hand the long-term debt market still shows some very sizable spreads and ultimately our share repurchases will manifest themselves in the longer-term debt. ", "On the other hand as you say UPS stock is on sale today at a great price and certainly we intend to be buyers. The exact pace of it will depend on conditions both in the debt markets and the equity markets but we do intend to be in there buying stock.", "Scott Davis ", "We love the stock obviously at this price and we like it to get up to a higher price, but I think Kurt said it right, the long-term debt markets need to stabilize. There has not been a lot of corporate debt issuance over the last two, three months. We need to see that stabilize. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robin Byde - HSBC Securities ", "Robin Byde - HSBC Securities ", "On trading in European package, can you provide some color on current market conditions perhaps by country, are you still seeing volume growth at your Cologne and Tamworth UPS?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "We have continued to see good growth in our intra European shipments. As we mentioned the products within, moving across borders within Europe grew at 10% so even with a somewhat stagnant European economy the network we\u2019ve built has allowed us continue to gain share.", "Some of the individual domestic markets clearly are seeing some headwinds and the UK most notably and then certainly Germany which is one of our largest markets has slowed a little bit. But the export market within Europe especially the eastern part of Europe, Poland, and some of those is continuing to show great results. ", "And I might note also that at least in the third quarter we continued to see shipments from Asia to Europe move along very strong. One of the fun things about us having built this balanced network is it gives us a view into how some of these trade flows are moving and in some sense diversifies our international results to not be quite so dependent on any one area. ", "Robin Byde - HSBC Securities ", "On the Shanghai hub opening in Q4, could you or would you want to delay this if Asian markets get a lot worse?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Absolutely not, that hub is a positive move for us. It improves our air network, allows us to improve our service and manage our costs better so we\u2019re full speed ahead with that. ", "Scott Davis ", "The developing economies are slowing down but they\u2019re still growing at a nice pace and again China is supposed to grow at 9% next year. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz - JP Morgan", "Tom Wadewitz - JP Morgan", "I wanted to see if you could give a few comments on how we should think about 2009, I know that\u2019s probably tough to do in light of perhaps not even visibility to peak season in fourth quarter but you mentioned some significant cost initiatives, if you bear those in mind and assume we do have a recession for a couple of quarters, do you think margins are down substantially in 2009 and earnings are down substantially or are there enough additional levers that you can push on in terms of cost and whatever else that you could have some king of stability in margins and flattish earnings?", "Scott Davis ", "As you look at the economy and again just, we\u2019re not a leading indicator so we kind of go on consensus estimates. I think generally people are looking for the economy in the US to be negative probably in the third and fourth quarter of 2008, probably the first quarter of 2009, beyond that maybe stabilizing some but there\u2019s certainly risk into 2009. ", "When you get into a recession after a financial crisis, its usually more of a U shape then a V shape so it may be a little bit longer. But I think generally our best barometers again are industrial production, retail sales and industrial production probably negative throughout a good part of 2009. Retail sales will growth but probably less then inflation. ", "Saying all that I think we still feel pretty good about UPS\u2019s prospects for 2009. I think that the first quarter may be one of the tougher comps for us but I think for the rest of the year, I think we stack up pretty good versus 2008. We\u2019re fairly optimistic. We\u2019ll get into more detail obviously in January on our next call. ", "Kurt Kuehn ", "We\u2019re working hard to right size our network for 2009. We do have the toughest comps in the first quarter but the labor contract continues to take more effect as we move farther into that and we\u2019re not gloomy on the US. We just think we\u2019ve got a couple more quarters that we\u2019ve got to manage and also we\u2019re continuing to see decent momentum in our supply chain and freight arena. We\u2019ve still got a little bit of a bumpy ride we think for a couple of quarters but hopefully after that we\u2019ll be able to show some more positive results. ", "Tom Wadewitz - JP Morgan", "On the pension side, in this market obviously downward pressure on assets and I think within the central states plan there is speculation about some risks that one of the big participants there eventually could have liquidity issues and that fund could get in a lot worse shape, can you tell us, is there any risk that you could get drawn back into that fund in the next couple of years, that it could deteriorate sufficiently or what are the protections that you don\u2019t somehow get drawn back into central states?", "Scott Davis ", "I think somebody made a statement like that and that statement really was inaccurate. There is three year look-back on this fund but its only in case that there\u2019s a mass withdrawal of the 2500 employers in that fund which is extraordinarily unlikely for all 2500 companies to pull out of it. Even if a large company goes bankrupt, they\u2019re not released of their contribution requirement until they liquidate and that\u2019s only one company out of 2500 companies. ", "We have about a little over two years left of that claw back look and its extraordinarily remote that we could ever get tied up in any problems they would have. Overall on the pension situation it is something that I think we\u2019ve all got to watch and manage from the single employer plans, I think right now you\u2019re seeing that investment results are down but the discount rates are up which help offset it. ", "UPS\u2019s own plan, we were well over funded going into this year and I think we\u2019re still even today 100% funded on it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of William Green - Morgan Stanley ", "William Green - Morgan Stanley ", "Can you talk a bit about how the pricing discussions are going with customers, obviously the economy I would think would lead them to push back a bit on some of the list rate increases you\u2019ve tried to put through. On the other hand one of your big competitors is struggling so much here that maybe you\u2019ve had more success in that regard. How are those discussions going?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Challenging but stable. Clearly with the fuel surcharges at record highs there was increased pressure on our customers and on us to find ways to take their costs down and as I stated the fuel surcharge really became a part of overall price negotiation. We\u2019ve been working through that and trying to make sure we keep those two separate but there has been pressure. If anything with fuel coming down we anticipate a little firmer environment as we start to see the results of this $70 fuel kick in and the fuel surcharges get back down to more reasonable amounts. ", "The market is competitive, clearly DHL was a very aggressive pricer in the market and they are a bit distracted right now. But costs are up and that\u2019s why we did put in a solid rate increase for next year, at net 4 9 on the air and 5 9 on the ground and certainly we intend to negotiate and keep the majority of that. ", "William Green - Morgan Stanley ", "With regard to the volume comments that you made can you talk a bit about where you\u2019re seeing the weakness, you mentioned the overnight envelope business but maybe in terms of B to C, has that slowed dramatically since the last time we spoke?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "It has, it has seen the most sequential slowing. Having said that it is still moderately positive. But it was, we\u2019ve seen double-digit growth in B to C for quite some time and clearly that\u2019s down to low single-digits now. On the B to B side there has been some deterioration, not as dramatic although it has continued to be negative. US imports as I mentioned is another area that\u2019s gotten very, very weak and US exports have been pretty strong although they did moderate to the mid single-digits this quarter although we continue to see just great gains in our international business across the world. ", "Right now at least the major change in the economy, the largest change seems to be on the consumer side.", "William Green - Morgan Stanley ", "Last call you mentioned you were doing a strategic review of your network because of fuel prices, have you stopped that with them coming down, or if so what was the conclusion?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Thankfully oil 200 seems a little more distant at this point, but no, this is all part of our long-term strategy. We create scenarios and we\u2019ve developed some insights around how the world would begin to change if fuel prices get back up to where they were and even higher and so it has us just evaluating opportunities, thinking about acquisitions, thinking about how our network would change. ", "In light of the fact that we are so far away from that right now it doesn\u2019t really make sense for me to get into any details, but this work will be ongoing so we\u2019re ready if and when it bounces back up.

When it comes to employees, we\u2019ve reduced 3000 employees this year, in the last year and again it moves pretty closely with the package volume and nothing has changed as far as our ability to manage the business on a daily basis and react to what we\u2019re seeing in the volume.", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Right now there\u2019s certainly a big focus on the semi variable things. Some of the network issues, management overhead, some of those indirect costs. Meanwhile the operations people clearly are highly attuned to make sure that the direct labor is matched to volume also and we\u2019ve had pretty good results on that. ", "Scott Davis ", "Generally the semi variable as we\u2019ve said before will take a couple of weeks to a few months to get implemented. Every quarter that goes by you\u2019ll see more of those kick in.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "What is the total employee base now?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "We have over 400,000 employees, around 300,000 in the US where most of the changes have been made.

We did see a trending down moderately over the course of the quarter but no where near as volatile and part of that\u2019s why we\u2019re still guiding to showing 5% growth in an environment where most of our competitors are flat or down.

I will say one thing that we\u2019re working very hard at and I think its part of how we\u2019ve been able to manage, this deep integration of our freight portfolio with express freight with small package is allowing us really to build a load plan for every major country to country lane and be able to take advantage of our fixed capacity for our freight when we have excess.", "This whole freight alignment is a great benefit for customers because they can easily choose from deferred forwarding activities all the way up to express freight and its also very good for us operationally as we learn to operate simultaneously as both an airline and a forwarder.

We think there has been some exaggeration of trade down especially into ground because of the high fuel prices. On the more strategic changes the redesign of your supply chain I think we said in Q2 there was a lot of discussion and interest in it, but we\u2019ve not seen a lot of big changes by companies.", "Our guess is it may make a difference on the increment, if you\u2019re going to add another factory somewhere in the world, maybe you think about adding one closer to home. So Latin America maybe central and eastern Europe makes more sense then Asia but not a big shift and clearly with the volatility right now its awful hard to peg. It is an interesting time and one with our solutions people staying real busy to help customers try to navigate a good long-term course. ", "Scott Davis  ", "Some of the near sourcing issue, some was driven by energy, a lot of it was driven by inflation, perhaps in China, maybe changing labor laws, there\u2019s a variety of things that were driving manufacturers to evaluate those decisions. ", "Justin Yagerman - Wachovia", "FedEx announced domestic Mexican service in the quarter and I think Southeastern Freight Line just went down there on the LTL side and a bunch of other truck load and LTL carriers do some business in Mexico, can you talk about how you\u2019re positioned there and if you have seen any increased interest from customers in terms of cross border Mexican moves or setting up manufacturing and distribution in Mexico?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "We\u2019ve clearly been in Mexico for quite some time with a domestic offering and so we\u2019re pretty well positioned and we\u2019re seeing some uptick. Probably more notable is the focus we\u2019ve had really for the last four to five years on the whole North American trading block with a big focus on our trans border products and our trade direct which allows Mexican manufacturers to move stuff across the border in mass and then distribute it into our small package network.", "So those trans border products moving between the US, Canada and Mexico continue to be very robust. Trade flows move back and forth clearly with the Canadian dollar changing so dramatically we may see some changes but those continue to be more and more important and that North American trading block remains very strong. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Ross \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ", "David Ross \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ", "When you first bought UPS freight there was a lot of talk about bundling the small package offering with the LTL service, can you just give us an update on where that is and if that\u2019s helping to mitigate some of the lower volumes you\u2019re seeing either on the ground package side or the LTL side?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Yes it is and we\u2019ve kind of got a tale of two parts on this LTL industry right now. Clearly the environment is tough, growth is negative and pricing has gotten a little more intense so we have become a little less aggressive then perhaps our initial plans were so as not to be chasing volume in a tough environment. ", "On the flip side as we\u2019ve brought our technology, our operating methods and our visibility services to customers there\u2019s been a tremendous adoption of them and being able to manage and process LTL shipments through our world ship shipping platform, be able to track them and get predictive information from our visibility systems is a huge value proposition so there is macro issues that are very tough but at the same time we are steadily imbedding our technology and our processes into that segment and over the long-term we feel very optimistic. Its just a tough market right now. ", "Scott Davis ", "I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned when we come out of this down draft we\u2019re in today. We\u2019ve made a big investment, the LTL market will recover, not sure of who all the players will be when we get out of there but we\u2019re going to be in a very good competitive position when we come out of this economy. ", "Kurt Kuehn ", "One of the things that\u2019s happening and you\u2019re seeing it in the LTL is we have taken our world ship platform which for many years has been a small package domestic application, and at this point now we have upward of 600,000 installed users across the globe. So its an international application and in the last couple of years we\u2019ve gone beyond package to include fully automated processing for LTL and deeply integrating airfreight. So we\u2019ve really created we think a pretty unique technology platform that\u2019s global and multi model and we see a lot of excitement about that and we\u2019re going to continue to press that. ", "David Ross \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ", "Given the current environment and near-term negative outlook the 32 aircraft you have on order right now, is that still pretty much in the plans, going to go through or are you going to rethink how many aircraft you might need given the current volumes?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "No at this point we have not made any announcements on changing that. Clearly with Boeing being distracted a little bit and production down, we\u2019ll have to see how their delivery schedules come. But that\u2019s a fairly modest amount spread over five years and over time we will be retiring our DC-8s also as the aging aircraft directives move forward. So it\u2019s a natural replacement cycle, timing may move a little bit.", "Scott Davis ", "And again the economy is troublesome today, we\u2019ll all looking, a lot of fear out there but there are positives out there. I think the lower energy price is going to help the consumer confidence as we move forward. I think the credit situation is beginning to improve. I think whenever the central banks can collaborate together, it\u2019s a powerful tool. We haven\u2019t had time yet to see the benefits of those lower interest rates, fiscal stimulus is out there. I know we\u2019re all wrapped up in what we\u2019re seeing today. We will get through this weak economy and get back to a normal economy. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Campbell - Thompson Davis", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis", "I just wanted to ask whether you had any fuel benefit in the international operations like the $90 million number you cited in domestic results.", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Yes, there was a modest amount, it\u2019s a fraction of what we saw in the domestic but its not significant in the international. ", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis", "Is that because it\u2019s a smaller component of expenses or just what, there was less of a lag or what?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "There is a wider array of different fuel surcharge schedules that aren\u2019t as responsive to that, so we did have a tailwind, maybe a penny or so from the international side but it was not a large amount. ", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis", "You have a very big range in earnings in the fourth quarter, basically $0.82 to $1.02, what would it take to earn at the upper end of that range, obviously some maybe lower fuel prices and better volume, but $1.02 is still a possibility?", "Scott Davis  ", "I think that the fourth quarter is always the most difficult for us to forecast because so much of it is tied to the Christmas season and I think that that not knowing, you see forecasts out there that say retail sales are going to grow this Christmas season, but you see forecasters say its going to be the worst since 1991. So there\u2019s a lot of different thoughts out there so I think we need to be cautious as far as the outlook for the fourth quarter and again so much of it is driven by the Christmas season, two or three weeks before Christmas, so its difficult to forecast.", "Kurt Kuehn ", "And we did say its likely that we\u2019ll be at the lower half of the range, although clearly there\u2019s opportunity and uncertainty in the fourth quarter. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets ", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets ", "Can you talk about the European ground network, what you\u2019ve done and what you can do to rationalize some costs there if volumes continue to decline?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Well so far they haven\u2019t declined, they\u2019re continuing to grow but we are being prudent on that. Its just good network planning within country it\u2019s important because there\u2019s very much more economic sensitivity within our domestic products whereas the trans border we still have this secular growth story of the European economy. We\u2019re looking at how we adjust routes, we have air and ground collaborating and coordinating. Some of the skills we\u2019ve learned after trying to do this for 100 years in the US serve us pretty well as we\u2019ve done this in Europe. There\u2019s still some good catalysts. Eastern Europe, central Europe continue to be showing good solid growth and the European economy continues to adapt.", "We\u2019re very focused on it, as in the US the air networks are less flexible then the ground networks so that\u2019s where we have to be the most diligent but in general we have similar structures that we do in the US.", "Scott Davis ", "The European ground network is very similar to the US ground network where we have a high degree of variable costs to manage through a downturn.", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets ", "Do you have an average share cost for the repurchases in Q3?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "We spent about $800 million in the third quarter and bought about 13 million shares, so its $63.00.", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets ", "The guidance obviously its effected by market conditions and what not, but the annual repurchase spend guidance was how much?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Our original target was to purchase $10 billion over the next couple of years and in the first half of the year we\u2019ve been clicking right at that steady rate. We did pull back a bit although we still spent $800 million and we\u2019re still committed to our repurchase program and on the other hand we don\u2019t want to be having to go out to the debt market right now where there\u2019s 400 and 500 basis points spread. We are leveraging commercial paper and we\u2019ll continue to buy and the speed will depend on how the credit markets look. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On the fuel benefit and some of the different businesses do you have a number for the supply chain and freight?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "No its not as significant there, there\u2019s a lot of flow through fuel surcharges on supply chain arena so its not as notable there. Clearly we\u2019ve got to stay on top of it to make sure our surcharges match the rapidly changing environment but I don\u2019t have a number on that. ", "Scott Davis ", "The lag is not nearly as important as it is on the package side.", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Yes, the LTL is much more rapid and certainly its real time for a lot of the airfreight. ", "Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "You\u2019ve gone through a few of the different trade lanes and how things were Asia to Europe you said was still strong, intra Europe still strong, can you comment on intra Asia and then Asia to US, I know you said US imports were weak but if you could quantify those two lanes.", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Intra Asia continued to be strong certainly above our average growth upper single-digits. US overall was as far as exports was mid single-digits. So the intra Asia we think is going to continue to have legs, that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in, breaking ground tomorrow on our intra Asia hub to help speed up that network and reduce its costs. Countries are trading with each other in Asia even as the US takes a break. ", "Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Asia to US?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Asia to US was down. All of the import markets were down mid single-digits.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark McVicar \u2013 Dresdner Kleinwort ", "Mark McVicar \u2013 Dresdner Kleinwort ", "Some parts of the international freight markets not specific to yours, are reporting issues and concerns around the availability of letters of credit that obviously sit behind the glove of the international trade flows, are you seeing any of that or are you hearing any of that from your cross border customers?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Not as a huge issue, clearly I\u2019ve read some anecdotes about that. We do have some products that can help customers with very short-term transactions if they\u2019re using our supply chain services, but in general that hasn\u2019t been a big issue yet. Its probably a bigger factor on some of the ocean shipments. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Arthur Hatfield - Morgan Keegan", "Arthur Hatfield - Morgan Keegan", "One of the things I struggle with and believe me I struggle with a lot of things is we hear a lot of comments that people thing we start to see the beginning of a recovery kind of mid point of next year, second half of next year, can you kind of put your finger on what you think needs to happen or what you think will be the catalyst to get consumers spending again? If this thing drags on into 2010 or even farther then that, at what point at you kind of really restricted on working down the costs? Do the variable aspect of your business get reduced as the length of time of slowdown increases?", "Scott Davis ", "I think as far as the economy I think there\u2019s a couple of positives, one is that energy prices have dropped dramatically. Two is I think we\u2019re beginning to thaw the credit issue out, I think the central bank collaboration has been a big move and we have to get credit flowing again to get these economies recovering. ", "Now the negative of that is the employment side of it is still probably going to get worse before it gets better and that\u2019s going to hurt consumer confidence. Perhaps if we get credit reestablished the mortgage rates will drop a bit and that will help the housing problem. We need to get to the bottom of that. So I think there are a couple of bright lights and I think the energy and the credit is looking better. We need to get those healed up before we recover. ", "So we are optimistic that maybe the latter part of next year we\u2019ll see some recovery. We\u2019ll continue to obviously manage our company very carefully. We\u2019re going to manage conservatively but still invest for the future. I guess the bottom line of this whole thing is the more pain there is out there and we don\u2019t want more pain, we\u2019re going to be a survivor. We\u2019ll come out of this thing in a great competitive position.", "We\u2019ll keep that in mind. We\u2019ll invest so that when we come out of this economy whether its six months, 12 months, 24 months we\u2019re going to be positioned to gain market share and grow this business.  ", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Just three key points before we set down the call, first UPS turned in a good performance in the quarter despite the weakening global economic environment. Second UPS continues to have a very strong balance sheet and third we expect earnings per share for the year towards the lower end of the $3.50 to $3.70 range we provided midyear.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Andy Dolny", "I\u2019m here this morning with Scott Davis our CEO and Kurt Kuehn our CFO to discuss the company\u2019s results for the quarter and our outlook for 2009. Before we begin, however, I\u2019ll briefly review the safe harbor language.", "Some of the comments we\u2019ll make today are forward looking statements that address our expectations for the company\u2019s future performance or results of operations. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2007 10-K and 2008 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.", "In the remarks today Scott and Kurt will compare results for 2008 against 2007 excluding the effects of adjustments that occurred in both years. This comparison is more reflective of UPS\u2019s true performance. There were two adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter 2008. The first was a $548 million good will impairment charge in our UPS Freight unit which is part of the supply chain and freight segment. This charge resulted from a number of factors. We acquired Overnight in 2005 when the economy was much stronger and valuations were higher. ", "We then invested in technology and operational improvements to enhance service and performance and expand product offerings. Unfortunately the current Freight environment has been a challenging one for new investments and customer focus is primarily on price. Long term, we believe our strategy is sound and will be viable when market conditions improve. We felt it prudent to reevaluate the good will associated with this acquisition and make a reduction based on current market comparisons and cash flow outlook.", "The second adjusted recorded in the quarter was a $27 million write down of intangibles in the UK Domestic operations, included in the International Package segment. This relates to a domestic customer list which was part of an acquisition. With the weak conditions in the UK and our emphasis on the export market this domestic customer list proved to be of less value then estimated.", "In the fourth quarter 2007 if you remember, we recognized a $6.1 billion charge in US Domestic Package segment to withdraw employees from the central states pension plan as part of our long term labor contract with the Teamsters. Any reference Scott and Kurt make to full year results excludes the impact of these adjustments as well as other charges in 2007 totaling $335 million. A reconciliation of these results is included with our earnings announcement this morning and appears on UPS\u2019s IR website in the financial information tab.", "Just a quick reminder, in December, based on customer considerations we decided to suspend pickups on the day after Christmas. We had one less operating day in the quarter then we had originally planned. We believe there was little if any volume lost in total. That\u2019s why when we talk about volumes today we\u2019re speaking about overall totals not average daily.", "To begin our review I\u2019ll turn the program over to Scott.", "Scott Davis", "What a difference a year makes. A year ago on the heals of momentum from our historic contract with the Teamsters we were optimistic about our prospects. Economics were predicting slow but growing US GDP and industrial production. It was debated whether we were in or heading into a recession. Globally experts question that decoupling theory. Very few saw what was about to unfold.", "Two thousand eight was very difficult. However, we responded well. Our operations team in the US continued to adjust the network as package volume deteriorated under worsening economic conditions. In our International segment export volume increased 6.8% as we benefited from the industries most diversified global network.", "The Supply Chain and Freight segment posted a 5% annual operating margin. This was at the top of the range we had provided at the beginning of the year. Our strong balance sheet and ability to generate cash enabled us to weather the financial market meltdown. Clearly we didn\u2019t meet all the goals we had set at the beginning of 2008 yet we still finished the year with an industry leading small package operating margin of 13%.", "Conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 continued to worsen. Industrial production fell, consumer spending dried up, and economic hardships spread throughout the world. In previous recessions consumer spending remained steady helping keep recessionary periods relatively short. This time, however, the consumer is not spending. Consequently experts predict that this recession will be worse then any we\u2019ve seen in several decades.", "We are adapting our company to the current environment. We are looking at everything; organizational structure, compensation, network configurations, products and services. How we do business, why we do it that way, what do we really need, what can we do without. We\u2019ve made changes in the last six months in the way in which we operate. One of those changes involves revenue enhancement initiatives. ", "Perhaps the most significant revenue opportunity stems from DHL\u2019s departure from the US Domestic market. We went after that business vigorously with a well executed plan. We gained significant new volume as a result. We have more opportunities in 2009 as we compete globally with them particularly on volumes in and out of the US. As for the airlift contract, we and DHL had been working on, negotiations are continuing. With reduced scale of airlift need we\u2019re finding it very difficult to reach an agreement. ", "Other changes we\u2019ve made include reduction of non-operating expenses through district and corporate consolidations. We\u2019ve made adjustments in our Ground and Air networks worldwide to reduce costs and adapt to the market conditions. These initiatives total over $500 million and will partially offset the impact of continued economic weakness. In addition, we are freezing management wages, reducing other forms of compensation and suspending the company\u2019s 401(k) match and other benefits. ", "However, I want to be clear, we will still make strategic investments that provide worldwide opportunities to grow UPS. Hence strengthen the services and solutions we bring to our customers. We believe our strategy and business model are sound in that UPS offers a vastly better value proposition to the marketplace then any of our competitors. Plans are in place to manage our costs while ensuring that we maintain high quality service to our customers.", "In times of economic difficulty like today\u2019s environment there is one certainty in business. When trends improve, and they will, the landscape will be different. Some companies will be gone. Others will still be viable but damaged and no longer competitive leaders. UPS will emerge stronger, leaner and more customer focused and well prepared to benefit from improving trends.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Kurt for a review of fourth quarter results.", "Kurt Kuehn", "In short, UPS\u2019s results clearly reflected the fourth quarter economic conditions. All of our businesses were negatively impacted. Earnings per share of $0.83 for the quarter, however, did enable us to achieve overall EPS of $3.50 for the year, within the range we provided to you over six months ago.", "I\u2019ll begin today\u2019s review with the Domestic Package operations. The 4.4% decline in total quarterly volume reflected a worsening of the economic trends we saw last year. UPS captured significant new volume as a result of DHL\u2019s departure from the US Domestic market. That volume, however, was not enough to offset declines from the economy.", "Revenue per piece was up marginally at 0.6%, because of the shift away from premium products and lower average weights. Weight per piece declined almost 10% for Air products and over 5% for Ground packages in the quarter. This is by far the largest decline in weight we\u2019ve seen in this decade. The benefit we realized from the two month lag in the fuel surcharge was more than offset by reduced volumes, lighter weights and declines in premium products.", "When we provided guidance back in the third quarter there was an implied fuel surcharge lag benefit based on the forward curve. This lag actually provided an additional benefit of $0.10 per share over what we\u2019d expected.", "During December we experienced a peak season that was very similar to last year, with shipping concentrated during the last week and a half prior to Christmas. Based on what we learned in 2007 we brought on peak season helpers later this year which allowed us to better manage the process. Our operations continue to adapt to the new environment. For the quarter block hours were down mid single digits, direct labor hours were down over 5% and miles driven declined by 4.5%, while service metrics continued at all time highs.", "During the quarter we proceeded with numerous restructuring and network changes. We announced the closure of six district offices and the elimination of night sort operations at our regional air hubs in Dallas, Texas, and Columbia, South Carolina. All as part of a rigorous realignment of our Air network. We also announced the closure of a large office facility in Georgia in an effort to consolidate our corporate functions. These moves are a part of an ongoing program to resize the organization to match the changed business environment.", "Now for a look at the International business, UPS benefits from very strong regional networks in all major areas of the world tied together by a global air network. This balanced presence is a competitive differentiator and one that we will continue to nurture with future investments. Export volumes increased by 1.6% this is significantly below the 5% growth we had anticipated for the quarter but it remains market leading.", "We saw weakness in the US with mid single digit export volume declines. Asia was also down slightly although China achieved double digit growth. Europe posted a mid single digit improvement based on continued strong intra-regional growth and Latin America experienced a double digit volume gain. ", "International operations are experiencing the same impacts as the US Small Package business, declining average weight per package and a shift away from premium products. This shift was much more pronounced in the fourth quarter then we\u2019d seen in prior quarters as we helped our customer\u2019s trade down not out of our comprehensive portfolio. These factors along with the currency impact contributed to a revenue per piece decline of over 8%. Removing currency, revenue per piece was down 3%.", "International operating margins declined to 14.9%. The positive impact on operating profit from fuel was more than offset by weakening global economic activity. For the quarter the fuel surcharge lag provided a benefit of $0.02 per share over what we\u2019d expected when we provided guidance. ", "We pointed out in the past that there are higher fixed versus variable costs in our International network and we\u2019re addressing this issue vigorously. We\u2019ve identified opportunities to reduce block hours in our worldwide air network during 2009 without sacrificing service or footprint. In Europe we\u2019re optimizing our ground network opportunities and have identified changes to be implemented in management and compensation of our outside service providers.", "At the same time we will continue to move forward. Non-US Domestic expansion will occur where there\u2019s minimal investment required. An example is our recently announced expansion of Domestic Express pickup and delivery service to 16 additional countries in Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America.", "In the quarter, UPS also continued investing to support long term growth opportunities. We opened our Air hub in Shanghai and broke ground on our new intra-Asian hub in Shenzhen, China that will be operational in 2010.", "Now let\u2019s look at the Supply Chain and Freight segment. Revenue declined 6.5%; operating margin was 2.6% for the quarter but came in at 5% for the year, at the high end of the range we had targeted at the beginning of 2008. As Andy mentioned, we did take a $548 million impairment charge in UPS Freight which experienced a disappointing fourth quarter. Declines in revenue and shipments reflected the very slow environment in the LTL sector. This poor performance severely impacted the operating profit for the segment. For the year UPS Freight did post slight profit.", "Weight per shipment improved slightly, although shipments per day were down. Price has become a major headwind today as excess capacity causes carriers to pull the pricing lever to defend share. Market watchers are of the opinion that this is one of the worst LTL environments ever. ", "To combat this situation we are intensifying our focus on cross selling the Freight portfolio to our Small Package customers. We have rolled out an enhanced world ship platform that allows customers to seamlessly optimize the selection between our hundred weight package service and LTL. This tool can help save a customer 10% to 15% in shipping costs.", "Global forwarding experienced a step down decline in revenue in November and December, reflecting the economy driven decreases in demand for customer\u2019s products. However, profitability for this unit improved in the quarter as compared to last year. Weight per shipment declined and lower fuel surcharges had a negative impact on revenue for the quarter, a trend that we expect to continue into 2009.", "Our logistics operation performed quite well. Revenue increased in high tech and healthcare but was down in retail and industrial sectors. Service levels in this business remained very high and profits continue to improve. Over the past several years UPS has built a comprehensive supply chain management capability focused on the healthcare industry. Merck\u2019s selection of UPS to operate a significant portion of its US distribution demonstrates the success that we are achieving in this market sector.", "Now for a recap of our end of year financial position. Even in the midst of the toughest environment in our careers UPS remains rock solid. UPS generated cash flow from operations of $8.5 billion for the year. Our capital expenditures for 2008 were $2.6 billion, about $400 million less then we\u2019d anticipated at the beginning of the year. This equates to approximately 5% of revenue at the low end of our historical range. We paid $2.2 billion in dividends and $3.6 billion to repurchase 53.6 million shares.", "We did slow our 2008 stock repurchase program when the long term debt market became volatile. With the dramatic changes in the economy during the year and continuing economic uncertainty we will be particularly prudent in our financial management. We will continue repurchases but at a significantly reduced rate. One of the defining characteristics of our business has always been UPS\u2019s ability to generate cash flow and 2008 was no exception with free cash flow of $5.7 billion.", "Now a quick update on our fund flow from operation to total debt metric. We targeted a range of 50% to 60% that we would reach by the end of 2009 and we finished 2008 at 68%. We\u2019ll continue working towards that range. As Scott said, everything is being evaluated from a financial as well as an operational perspective. We will manage the business in light of today\u2019s realities but also to make sure that we\u2019re in position to capitalize on opportunities as they materialize.", "Now for some insights into 2009. We have our work cut out for us this year which will likely be even more difficult than 2008, with forecasters not anticipating any real economic recovery until 2010 UPS earnings for 2009 will suffer. Because of the amount of uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions it is premature to give full year guidance. If we did it would have to be a very wide range which in our opinion is not helpful. ", "Instead we will provide earnings guidance for the first quarter of this year which we expect will be between $0.52 and $0.68 per share. The first quarter will be weak, with slight improvements later in the year as initiatives take hold. ", "At the end of 2008 our pension plan funding levels were down substantially from the previous year, in concert with the decline seen in the investment markets. Although these plans remain well funded we will experience a pension expense increase that will have a drag of approximately $0.10 per share for the year.", "Another impact on the year involves fuel surcharges. When they were rapidly escalating, in some cases we discounted base rates in order to preserve the surcharges. Now as they have fallen it will take time to cycle through the contract negotiation process to pull back some of those base rate discounts. We believe this will be an impact throughout 2009.", "For the first quarter average daily volume in the Domestic operation is expected to decline between 3% to 5%. We anticipate package weight will remain lighter than our historical averages until the economy begins to rebound. International export volume should be down somewhat for the quarter. The Supply Chain and Freight segment should post an operating margin similar to that of the fourth quarter with UPS Freight particularly challenged through 2009.", "Over the longer term we are evaluating operational changes that would leverage our small package, forwarding and freight ground assets in the US in an effort to capitalize on network economies of scale. Ultimately it\u2019s our plan to generate operational changed through both better alignment of our networks and asset utilization.", "With respect to capital expenditures our budget for 2009 will be $2.2 billion, some $400 million less then 2008\u2019s total. At less then 5% of revenue this will be the lowest we\u2019ve seen this decade. While the current outlook is sobering to say the least we are taking measures to strengthen the company while focusing on helping our customers survive today\u2019s economic difficulties. These steps will help UPS preserve its financial strength and enhance its leadership position in the industry.", "Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from [Rob Samanon] \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "[Rob Samanon] \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "Could you guys give us a sense; in the prepared remarks you indicated that the pricing trends were stable in the Domestic Small Parcel. Could you give us a sense of how the pricing trends were throughout the quarter particularly after DHL had made their announcement if you guys had seen a step up in terms of pricing? If you could give us the actual price per package for each month as well as January would be helpful.", "Kurt Kuehn", "I won\u2019t get into that granular of detail. Certainly we do see over time improved pricing power in the industry. At the same time the dramatic changes in fuel surcharges are creating a lot of moving parts so it is going to be challenging externally to fully be able to map all of those factors. In general, we do feel that the pricing environment is very rational. ", "Certainly the DHL exit has a big impact on the market. Their volume is however lighter weight than average and most likely at a lower average revenue per piece although clearly as we have priced these DHL customers we are extracting an appropriate premium for UPS service and quality. It will be a year transition but overall we remain resolute in being disciplined for pricing. As the fuel surcharge impact filters through we think that it will be evident that the market is very rational.", "[Rob Samanon] \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "Shifting gears to the capital expenditure side of things, could you give us a sense in terms of your share repurchase plan. You had indicated that you would scale it back significantly what that means and how we should be thinking about the repurchase throughout 2009 as well as if you could give us a sense what your thoughts are on the dividend here as well.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Right now the mantra has been conserve capital. Given the current uncertainty our balance sheet remains a thing of beauty and is an absolute strength for us that we intend to protect. We are being prudent, we did slow the stock repurchases, we do remain committed to repurchasing and retiring shares over time but we also want to make sure that we preserve our liquidity and flexibility.", "We did, as you can see, take aggressive steps to reduce capital expenditures, pulling back to just committed deliveries of assets, completing our world port hub expansion which is one of the things that\u2019s allowing us to make such dramatic improvements in our air network. We\u2019ll be very prudent and cautious on that but still with a strong AA rating we\u2019ve got plenty of horsepower.", "Scott Davis", "Our intent is to continue to reward our share owners be it dividends and share repurchase in 2009, even in this economic environment. Kurt said earlier that likely share repurchase will be at a smaller amount; I think that is prudent based on what\u2019s gone on in the credit markets. We are seeing some stabilization in the credit markets recently. ", "As far as dividend policy it\u2019s determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors. I will remind you that despite earnings being down about 15% in 2008 versus 2007 that our free cash flow was outstanding at $5.7 billion. The cash position is great. We will take a look at that, the Board meets next week and normally looks at dividend policies at that point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I wondered if you could shed a little bit more light on the change in weight per package. You said DHL was a lower weight competitor. How much of what you\u2019re experiencing is just mix in picking up that volume and how much of it is customer mix and what should we expect looking forward with industrial economy doing what its doing should we expect the weight problem to get worse during the first quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "That\u2019s one of the first times I\u2019ve heard a weight problem being lowing weight, in this case it may be. The majority of it is the economic cycle. We\u2019ve been talking to that the last three or four quarters. Clearly in slow economic times there are just plain less widgets per box and so the average weight of each package does tend to drift down.", "Having said that we did see an acceleration in that in the fourth quarter. Certainly we think some of that acceleration is market share gain from DHL. It\u2019s still a moving target; DHL really has just wrapped up their domestic operations. It\u2019s too soon for us to really characterize that or give you any specifics on the impact. We do think that that will continue to bring volume to our network but in some cases lower weight than average.", "We did see the same trends internationally where the weight shifts were substantial. Certainly that\u2019s primarily economically driven right now.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "As you think about the actions that you\u2019re taking to resize the networks; segment reductions, compensation changes, etc. is there a way for us to think about how much of that was completed and in place within the fourth quarter result that we\u2019ve already seen and how much is yet to come.", "Kurt Kuehn", "The $500 million in network changes, operational changes and some of those, the majority of that is still rolling out. Certainly there was some portion of that towards the end of the year. I would say the majority is still to be realized. The compensation changes that we announced that are in addition to that really don\u2019t begin to kick in until March which is our normal annual pay cycle. ", "There\u2019s certainly still benefits to come from that and we will both extract benefits out of that and frankly we\u2019re busy working on continued review of initiatives all across the company, it\u2019s a top priority for us and we\u2019re going to make sure the company stays in good shape.", "Scott Davis", "We\u2019ve had a hiring freeze on throughout most of 2008 and all that benefits with attrition as people leave the payroll we don\u2019t replace those people. Kurt mentioned in his earlier comments that remember that we\u2019re managing our workforce everyday and you saw that in the last quarter where direct labor hours were down more than volume 5.1% versus 4.4%. We\u2019ll continue to manage the variable costs on a daily basis.", "Some of the organizational structure changes, we made some of the last year, we made some of them effective in January where we took down six more district offices which will help our organization moving forward. Some of it you saw in 2008 but a lot of it is coming in 2009.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Is this sizing into the current economy or something a bit deeper?", "Scott Davis", "We certainly expect the first half of this year to be worse then what we saw in 2008. As a result, we\u2019re going to manage the company to those levels. We don\u2019t know when its going to turn around but we\u2019re going to manage it as if it\u2019s going to stay down for certainly all of 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "When you think about right sizing the network and let\u2019s call it you giving guidance of -3% to -5% in Domestic and slightly negative in International. Let\u2019s call it negative low something for the rest of the year. Can you catch up by third; fourth quarter assuming we don\u2019t go from -3% or 5% to -10% if it just says in that range? Can you start to see the margin year over year improve or that\u2019s impossible the way the network is over that period of time?", "Scott Davis", "It\u2019s going to be very difficult to improve the margins if we have a declining economy. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to hold the margins the best we can. With the mix of the products and as Kurt talked about the huge drop in weight in the products we saw in the fourth quarter it\u2019s likely to continue the first half of the year. It\u2019s going to be a challenge for us to do that. We\u2019re going to do everything in our power and we\u2019re going to presume the economy keeps getting worse. ", "Frankly I think the economy you\u2019re going to see the biggest drop in the first quarter of \u201909 even worse then the down 3.8% and down 6% IP numbers we saw in the fourth quarter. Second quarter will probably negative not quite as bad. It\u2019s not unrealistic to say it\u2019s going to flatten out at the end of the year, the economy. We\u2019re going to manage it as if it\u2019s going to stay at the first and second quarter levels.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "If Domestic and International volume are both negative should we assume in International margins deteriorate more given the fixed cost nature of it and that they\u2019re coming from higher places.", "Kurt Kuehn", "We\u2019re really not in a position to go too far on outlook right now. Clearly there is a higher portion of fixed costs but we\u2019re taking some pretty dramatic steps to take that cost out. One silver lining since you\u2019re binning for some good news, the dramatic reduction in fuel surcharges from up in the 30% plus down to what will be only a 1% surcharge in February. ", "We think will have a beneficial effect on our premium products. Certainly in a tough economy that\u2019s not going to come booming back but we do think that we will begin to see more of a balanced growth between our ground and air and our deferred products and our premium air. That will certainly be a positive as we begin to reverse some of those negative headwinds.", "Scott Davis", "As challenging as the economy has been including Europe we still showed pretty good transporter growth in Europe and expect to continue that growth in 2009.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "The deferred Air yields that really weakened this quarter is that DHL stuff coming towards deferred more than other products or is there something you\u2019re doing in particular there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "That\u2019s always a very volatile segment. Yes, plus or minus a few big customers can make a big difference in that. You\u2019ll see that one jumps around. I wouldn\u2019t draw too fine a point on that.", "Scott Davis", "The majority of DHL volume is heading towards Ground also.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jon Langenfeld \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Jon Langenfeld \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Can you talk about the balance sheet and primarily the shareholder equity? I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s probably a pension hit in there and you\u2019ve got the write down. Essentially shareholder equity down by about $4 billion sequentially can you walk me through the puts and takes there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "The big factor on that were the declines in our pension. We had a fairly substantial pension asset at the end of last year that basically has been eliminated and actually we did then show an increase in liability of a couple billion on that side. In addition, we did repurchase $3.6 billion of shares this year. In aggregate the combination of the loss on the pension, the repurchase of stock and we did have one extra dividend payment in \u201908 due to a tightening up the calendar but we really paid the November dividend before the end of the year combined. Those were really the three primary factors.", "Scott Davis", "The pension thing was a difficult issue for all companies with defined benefits. What happens everybody has investment losses in 2008. At the end of the year the discount rate actually came down so it increased the liability. Its one of those things that hopefully see that turn around the next year or two.", "Kurt Kuehn", "We do our pension plans are still in pretty good shape, they\u2019re about 90% funded. That\u2019s with us coming into the year with about 130% funding something like that. The combination of investment reductions and expenses reduced that. It is an issue for us; it is adding about $0.10 a share headwind on costs this year. We\u2019re going to continue to manage that and we think the strength of our pension plan remains an asset for the company.", "Scott Davis", "Even in this environment where we saw that kind of drop in asset value in pension plans we\u2019re still well funded. A lot of other companies in the US are not well funded and we use our free cash flow to fund pensions in future years.", "Jon Langenfeld \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "How big was the pension charge to shareholder equity in the quarter?", "Scott Davis", "$3.5 billion after tax. That\u2019s the hit on equity.", "Jon Langenfeld \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "The fuel side you quantified it in the call relative to your expectations that is was $0.10 more, $0.02 more in Domestic and International. What was it in total benefit excluding your expectations?", "Kurt Kuehn", "There\u2019s a lot of moving parts on that. You have to factor in expenses direct and indirect and all of that so really the guidance we\u2019ve been giving is the relative impact of the month over month changes with the two month lag. That\u2019s really all that we\u2019re comfortable saying today.", "Jon Langenfeld \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "You had some expectations in your original guidance; the numbers you gave on the call were incremental to that.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Absolutely and that\u2019s what we tried to provide some clarity on.", "Jon Langenfeld \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "On the International side how much of the cost initiatives and revenue enhancement initiatives, two different things, are targeted on the International side versus Domestic?", "Kurt Kuehn", "There\u2019s a significant amount of focus on the International. It\u2019s maybe a half a step behind the Domestic frankly. Our growth has remained very strong just up until this fourth quarter. We are digging in very heavily on that looking at our air network, making sure that we\u2019re being prudent in the amount of capacity we have in the air. ", "We\u2019re also looking at operational models, I mentioned our European ground network looking for opportunities to better align our large forwarding operation in Europe and our package operations. There are plenty of opportunities. It is, as I\u2019ve said a little behind the progress of the Domestic where we\u2019ve been facing reduced demand for some time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "I wanted to try to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about the pace of operating expense increase when you look at 2009. You\u2019ve got some pretty significant cost reduction actions but I know you have some inflation and your Teamster labor contract and so forth. If you take out the impact of fuel and you consider some of the cost savings and maybe your volume outlook what\u2019s the magnitude of operating expense change in 2009, do you have any sense of that? Is it down a couple percent, is it down mid single digits, can it be down 10%?", "Kurt Kuehn", "As you know we\u2019re very focused, always focused on making sure that we adjust our hours to match the demand. Our operations people did a superb job in the fourth quarter reducing direct labor hours in excess of volume. We\u2019re going to continue to have high expectations from them to adapt and react and make sure that we are eliminating and reducing hours wherever possible.", "As you correctly pointed out we do have a labor increase that becomes a little more challenging in a no growth environment because the average seniority moves up and with the very favorable contract we got we get the full benefit with moderate growth. There are some headwinds in that area; pension expense as we mentioned will be up. ", "We are very focused across the company to right size and match the management compensation and variable comp plans are changing, our operators are reinventing the wheel as it is to make sure that as volume continues to be down and this will really be two years as we wrap some of these other declines, those are substantial changes. We\u2019re re-jiggering the network and doing everything we can. The goal is to have our direct hours move in concert with the volume reductions and then we\u2019re working very hard on all the other expenses.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "If you consider the inflation in the union agreements and then you consider the cost reductions are you essentially offsetting the inflation in the union agreements with the specific cost reduction measures you have?", "Kurt Kuehn", "If we can fully offset expense increases we\u2019re doing great. We do expect real revenue per piece to continue to increase. That would be an admirable goal if we can really hold cost per piece absolutely flat in a tough economy with shrinking volumes. I\u2019m not sure we can get all the way there but clearly that\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re working towards.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "On the pricing side you sounded rational pricing which obviously is good but you also said maybe base rate is down because the optics of what you had done to preserve fuel surcharge mechanism might hurt you going forward. If you take out weight per piece impact and take out fuel surcharges do you think on a comparable basis the base rate is actually down in 2009?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No we don\u2019t. We\u2019ve gone back and done some extensive look at this over the last eight or nine years and there\u2019s clearly an inverse relationship between fuel surcharges and base rate retention. When fuel surcharges go up we do see a very clear reduction in our ability to keep more of the base rate. Conversely if that corrects we do see better base rate retention. Actually over the course of \u201909 we should see better base rate retention then \u201908 but there is a little bit of a lag as we go back, renegotiate contracts. ", "Our Air customers will see dramatic reduction in expense this year because of the precipitous declines in the fuel surcharge. We think that will allow over time better base rate keep. It\u2019s a transition and it needs to be rational and sensitive to our customers needs. We do feel good over the longer term that you\u2019ll see solid and continued base rate retention.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "In the first quarter guidance how much have you assumed on a per share basis from fuel or from the squeeze on base rates?", "Kurt Kuehn", "If you look at our fuel surcharges you are going to see some pretty dramatic surcharge reductions versus last year. Ballpark for the quarter based on what\u2019s in the bank and where the forward curve looks at we\u2019ll probably have about a 15% lower fuel surcharge Q1 of \u201909 versus Q1 of \u201908 on the Air and probably a 3% headwind on the Ground. Those are some fairly significant shifts year over year. Not all of that goes directly to what the overall revenue per piece will be. Compliance is not 100% and we do think we\u2019ll have some compensation on the base rate side.", "It will be a very volatile series for you to track as we have these very significant year over year changes. We will get a slight benefit of the fuel lag. Certainly no where near what we saw in the fourth quarter. The predominant issue we\u2019ll be facing is to make sure that we are working with our customers in beginning to balance the appropriate rates now that the fuel has come way back down.", "Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On a net basis then is fuel, does it turn to a negative in Q1 or do you still have some lag benefit.", "Kurt Kuehn", "There\u2019s still a slight benefit in Q1.", "Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "What was the effect in Q4 of exchange at a total company level both on revenue and on operating profit can you break that out for us?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Exchange rates were relatively neutral. We do fortunately had some favorable hedges in place that actually cost us some profits as the Euro and the Pound were at very high rates because we sold away some of the top end but now that they\u2019re plummeting we are able to stabilize it. That\u2019s really the intent of the hedges to stabilize earnings volatility.", "There was a benefit to the hedges and a slight benefit for some revaluation of assets but you\u2019re talking small amounts. We were very pleased for the International that the hedges were as we expected. We are well hedged through \u201909 for the Euro and for the Pound through the first half of the year.", "Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "You\u2019re bringing down CapEx; slowing down the share repurchases I would assume you\u2019ll still generate significant cash flow. Is the first priority to start paying down some of the debt or where else would it go?", "Scott Davis", "UPS is always a company that generates free cash flow, you saw that in 2008. You\u2019ll see it again in 2009. We\u2019re still going to make distribution to shareowners via dividends and via the share repurchase. Share repurchase not at the same level probably as we saw in 2008. There will be opportunities out there for us too. We think great companies get stronger in down economies. We think there will be opportunities for UPS to buy assets and/or companies below market value in the year or two ahead of us.", "We think this is a great opportunity to keep our powder dry and look for opportunities to make UPS a strong company for the future.", "Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "No emphasis on debt repayment at this point you\u2019re happy with the current leverage?", "Scott Davis", "We\u2019re happy. Our funds from operations to debt is about the 60% level we targeted and we\u2019ll keep it probably in that level in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Green \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "William Green \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "As we looked at the fourth quarter, economic activity obviously slowed. Can you give a little bit more color around how your volumes trended by month in the quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It was an interesting quarter that way. We saw sequential worsening from October to November. The discussion we had in October things began actually trending down even worse in November. There is the impact of when Thanksgiving fell that makes the November/December results a little tangled. We actually were somewhat pleased by the way the holiday turned out. Volume overall for the holiday season was close to flat with last year. Although as we mentioned earlier it was the wait until the last week and a half syndrome that we had that does make things a little challenging.", "We did see firming up of our volume trends during the holidays. Certainly some of that is most likely customers that decided to jump over to UPS in light of the dramatic uncertainty at DHL during the holidays. Trying to separate exactly what was that transition and what was true strength in the economy is tough. We do think though, based on our guidance we gave you that trends are going to return back closer to what they looked like in October and maybe November then what we had in December.", "One interesting note, on the internet shipping this year we did see much more modest growth and really the internet shippers did not outperform the rest of the bricks and mortar this year, although certainly there were a few notable exceptions like Amazon. It was a little different peak as far as the mix of customers.", "William Green \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Was your B to C trend was it much slower then you\u2019ve seen in the past? You had been adding a point or so in terms of total percentage of the Domestic volume I think around 30% or so.", "Kurt Kuehn", "It certainly continued to outgrow but we have seen big sequential changes back to Scott\u2019s comments about the consumer in B to C volumes slowing. The consumer did come through and we did see B to C increases in the fourth quarter at least in December.", "William Green \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "In January the trends that you gave for the quarterly guidance January trends were roughly in line with that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Pretty much. It\u2019s been a noisy January with substantial weather events, with the Inauguration. In general we think that based on what we\u2019re seeing in January that guidance is appropriate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets", "Looking at the CapEx budget what\u2019s your minimum maintenance CapEx level?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We\u2019ve had a number of discussions on that. Probably the best approximation we have for maintenance CapEx is our deprecation expense. We are still modestly above that. We\u2019ve been fairly rigorous this year in looking at CapEx. We do have some growth CapEx in for next year, the completion of the world port hub and additional receipts of some aircraft, 767\u2019s and 747\u2019s. Certainly we\u2019ve tightened up in most areas and are really restricting to maintenance on our facilities and our vehicles at this point.", "Having said that, the world port expansion is both an expansion of capacity and also a tremendous efficiency move as I mentioned earlier. Because of having such amount of capacity in one location we are able to reduce the number of regional air sorts we have, make much better utilization of our aircraft. We\u2019ll continue to invest where it makes sense. We have to the capital but we\u2019re going to be prudent right now.", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets", "Where I was getting at was if you break down stuff like aircraft deliveries of what\u2019s scheduled for \u201909 of the 767\u2019s and the 400\u2019s?", "Scott Davis", "Three 767\u2019s and three 747\u2019s come in in \u201909.", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets", "The 26 other planes are 2010 and beyond. I was trying to see if its possible to push those back especially with fuel is not as big an issue now if flying the 200\u2019s and some of the older planes is more attractive if you can hold off on those purchases.", "Kurt Kuehn", "We\u2019re looking at that. At the same time we do intend over time to migrate the DC-8 suite out with aging aircraft directives, it\u2019s likely in the next three to four years that most of those will become uneconomic. We\u2019re balancing that. We do have cash. We think we\u2019ve got favorable terms and if it makes sense to defer out we\u2019ll certainly talk with Boeing and any other providers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America", "You were talking about pricing before in the contract; I want to understand that a little bit better. If you\u2019ve got contracts with customers and as fuel was running up did you go back to them and reduce the base rate in that in order to keep them. Obviously you felt some competitive pressure to do that if that\u2019s exactly what you were highlighting. Did the contract not automatically revert if fuel fell as dramatically as it has? I want to understand the process and the time that it\u2019s going to take to retest some of those base rates.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Maybe the simplest way to think of it is more that as we do our annual rate change and go to customers with a rate increase we negotiate how much of that to retain in their expenses. When you\u2019ve got fuel at 20%, 30% plus percent it\u2019s very difficult to retain much of that base rate increase. It\u2019s more over the course of last year. In some cases we did sacrifice base rate increase because of the extreme costs that our customers were facing for fuel.", "As that moderates then we do begin to recover and get more back on to a normal approach of keeping the base rate increase.", "Scott Davis", "That shouldn\u2019t really be a surprise. We\u2019ve talked about that over the last two years of the impact fuel had on base rate.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Its one of the reasons it\u2019s very difficult to just purely pull the fuel surcharge out of our overall rate changes as far as what the real pricing is going on.", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America", "I was trying to see if there was a timing impact on that. On the UK it sounded like on this write down that you\u2019re taking are you shifting from providing Domestic services in the UK or did I misinterpret what you were saying there.", "Kurt Kuehn", "What that is, is we did make a domestic acquisition in the UK several years ago. Over the last couple of years have been busy integrating that with expanded hub in the domestic area. As we reviewed the operations there and looked at the impact of the economy most notably on the Domestic UK business it was clear that the value we had assigned to their existing customer base really was not appropriate. Many of those customers had churned out. Certainly we brought Domestic services to a lot of our import/export customers so in general the business is healthy.", "As part of the acquisition we attributed a value to the customer base and as we reviewed that it was clear given where the economy is and the migration in our customer base more from the ones we had from the acquisition to our existing customers with Express that it made sense to adjust it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Ross \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "David Ross \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "A question on UPS Freight, it looks like you\u2019ve lost some money there in the fourth quarter and its pretty challenging LTL environment out there as you mentioned. With the network you currently have in place after integrating overnight and motor cargo have you had to rationalize that at all, have you closed any terminals or tweaking that network?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We really did quite a bit of that as part of the integration of the motor cargo group and the overnight group. We don\u2019t see dramatic changes in the physical assets. We do believe we\u2019re going to continue to gain share. You can see that our growth did slow substantially. Some of that is in some cases losing some big customers that we have just decided not to chase. We still feel pretty confident that we will get back on a very strong growth curve with market share gains. It has been a tough year and we\u2019re still trying to strike that balance of helping our customers save money as we bring them more value.", "As I said, one of the things that are proving most successful now is what we call our Freight Rate Calculator, which allows shipping managers to see rates in an LTL format for both our small package and our freight services. It\u2019s been very successful of us going to customers, helping them reduce their spend by 10% to 15%, without a lot of rate pressure because we can find the best mode for each shipment individually and show that in a way that\u2019s apples to apples.", "We are going to continue to enhance service, invest in technology but at the same time in this environment we\u2019ve got to make sure that we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves and we will continue to be cautious on that. Clearly UPS Freight is on a cost reduction campaign also. Long term we\u2019re optimistic but given the current environment we just thought it was prudent to take the impairment.", "David Ross \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "With the cross sell between LTL and Parcel where are you in penetration of Parcel customers with the LTL business? I know it\u2019s been targeted for a while but any color, just scratching the surface or you have a ways to go?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We\u2019re still in the early innings. We\u2019ve been a little disappointed that that\u2019s taken us longer than we\u2019d hoped. Some of the economic uncertainty and chaos has distracted our customers and maybe even our sales people a little bit. That is a priority for us this year and we are very confident it\u2019s a unique differentiator.", "Scott Davis", "I\u2019ve just come back from visiting all of our Domestic region locations. That\u2019s a high topic, big priority for our company in 2009. Our people are going to pay a lot of attention to that cross selling opportunity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robin Byde \u2013 HSBC", "Robin Byde \u2013 HSBC", "On DHL and your Q1 earnings guidance, to clarify, does the range you\u2019ve given assume volume gains from the DHL shutdown or is this guidance just on the underlying business?", "Kurt Kuehn", "This guidance is our best guess of what will come through in Q1. As I said, it\u2019s still a little bit of a moving target as operations just ceased there last week. We have a number of customers that came on board in the fourth quarter. Certainly there\u2019s more that we\u2019re brining on board in January. Until the dust settles we\u2019re hesitant to give you any specific information. Clearly we\u2019ll talk more about DHL in the next quarters call.", "One note I do want to make though is that this is not just a domestic US event. Within the US we are also seeing a number of customers come to us related to their import/export needs as DHL reduces their service footprint. We think our value proposition for our international network is compelling. Also we are seeing increased interest outside the US in customers coming to UPS. We intend to press the advantage across the globe.", "Robin Byde \u2013 HSBC", "A question on your European operations, could you tell us what you\u2019re seeing in terms of slowdown on Asia to Europe trade. Are market trends getting weaker or flattening out?", "Kurt Kuehn", "There certainly getting much weaker. The areas of continued strength, although strength is stretching it, we\u2019re continuing to see intra-Europe trade remain more vibrant although that\u2019s primarily small package. Clearly Asia to Europe is close to flat now where we had seen very strong growth.", "Scott Davis", "That\u2019s probably the biggest change we might have seen in the fourth quarter was the Asia to Europe was growing at a fast pace up until the fourth quarter and really moderated.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from David Campbell \u2013 Thompson, Davis & Co.", "David Campbell \u2013 Thompson, Davis & Co.", "I\u2019m surprised how much money you made internationally in the quarter given the fact that revenues were down substantially from the third quarter you made almost the same amount of money as the third quarter, in fact you made a little bit more on an adjusted basis. What is it other than fuel consumption is there anything going on there?", "Scott Davis", "There\u2019s seasonality there to a certain extent. We expect to make normally more money in the fourth quarter then we do in the third. If you recall the third quarter in Europe, there are so many holidays there in August that it almost shuts down, it\u2019s a tough quarter for us. We did a nice job internationally; we\u2019d still like to see more profits in the fourth quarter then what we made.", "David Campbell \u2013 Thompson, Davis & Co.", "You wouldn\u2019t expect that same situation in the first quarter.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Q3 to Q4 is always an increase. As Scott said, we\u2019re looking to continue to improve margins. We do see challenging comps Q1 over Q1 and that\u2019s built into our guidance. The International though is changing more rapidly then the Domestic. Domestic we\u2019ve been fairly stable over the last quarter or two although month to month it can change. The International we\u2019re staying on our high alert to make sure we right size the network.", "Scott Davis", "Let\u2019s wrap up with a few comments. Nobody is escaping pain in this financial crisis. Our employees feel it, our customers feel it and certainly our shareowners feel it. I want to remind you that we\u2019re a great company that\u2019s operating in a bad economy right now. Great companies do weather the storm and they come out stronger. What it comes down to is the strength of our balance sheet, the power of our brands, the value of our services, the contributions of our people and the quality of our leadership. UPS has all of these strengths and we will prosper as we move into the future.

(Operator Instructions)  It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations.  ", "Andy Dolny", "In a moment, Scott Davis our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn our CFO, will discuss first quarter results and expectations going forward.  Before they begin, however, I\u2019ll briefly review the Safe Harbor language.  Some of the comments we\u2019ll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. ", "These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2008 Form 10-K report.  This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.", "Before I turn the program over to Scott, I want to point out that there was an aircraft impairment charge of $181 million in the quarter that reduced operating profit in the U.S. domestic package segment.  This resulted from the earlier than planned retirement of UPS's entire DC-8 fleet of 44 aircraft.  Retiring these aircraft will give us the most modern, fuel efficient and noise compliant fleet in our industry.  The after tax impact of this charge was $116 million or $0.12 per share.  ", "Excluding the impairment, adjusted earnings per share are $0.52.  This is the amount that Scott and Kurt will refer to in their comments this morning.  Reconciliation of this adjustment to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning.  The schedules are also available on the UPS IR website in the financial section.  ", "For the quarter, you'll also notice our effective tax rate was a little higher than expected.  This was due to evaluation allowance we recorded during the quarter, which should have no impact on our expected tax rate of 36% for the reaming quarters in 2009.  ", "To begin our review of the quarter, I'll turn the program over to Scott for opening comments.  ", "Scott Davis", "In the first quarter, the global economic downturn intensified.  In fact, forecasted GDP growth in 2009 for the top UPS markets is now expected to be less than last year and is negative in all but two, China and Poland.  Looking at the U.S. of most interest to us is industrial production, which for the first quarter fell 20% quarter-to-quarter and 11.7% year-over-year.  ", "The second quarter is expected to be modestly weaker than the first.  We anticipate second quarter GDP will also decrease quarter-over-quarter, but at a much slower rate than the decline we saw in the last two quarters.  Hopefully, we will hit bottom later this year and begin seeing growth at the end of the year or early next year in the U.S.  ", "On the international front, Asia should see improvement in the same timeframe, but certainly at different degrees in different countries.  Europe most likely will lag the rest of the world in the pace of its recovery.  Against this background, I'm pleased to say UPS is managing its operations effectively.  While we're certainly not happy with the declines in revenue and profit, we do have a number of bright spots.  ", "Both our U.S. domestic and international package businesses gained market share and continue to generate industry leading margins.  Our revenue enhancement and cost containment efforts are bearing fruit.  Service levels in all our businesses are at all time highs.  Our financial strength proved beneficial in support of a very successful debt offering during the quarter.", "And many of the operational and process changes we're implementing to meet today's challenges are producing results now and it will remain effective when the business environment improves.  All in all, UPS will emerge from these difficult times as a more efficient finely honed enterprise.  ", "In the midst of this worldwide recession, no one should lose focus on the importance of global trade.  It is one of the most important tools we have to help lift us out of this financial crisis.  In fact, at the risk of oversimplifying, it may be the very most important tool.  The fragile global economic conditions we're all dealing with raise a serious danger of increased protectionism, as individual countries seek to bolster their own economies without regard to broader implications.  ", "Global trade has fostered two decades of dramatic growth and increased prosperity in countries everywhere.  Now is not the time to back away from the progress that has been achieved in the mistaken belief that any one economy can regain strength independently of the rest of the world.  ", "Now, for a few comments on our dealings with DHL, in light of DHL's reduced airlift needs, we were unable to reach an agreement that made financial sense to UPS; therefore, we mutually agreed to terminate the negotiations.  However, UPS has been successful in our efforts to attract former DHL customers in the U.S. domestic market.  Kurt will provide details shortly.  ", "The changing competitive environment offers UPS significant growth opportunities.  Our balanced worldwide presence, broad product portfolio, financial strength and knowledgeable dedicated personnel are a combination no other player in this industry can match.  Customers, both present and future, will benefit from this unique value proposition.  ", "Before I turn the program over to Kurt, I want to take a moment to thank UPSers for their dedication and hard work.  They are achieving exceptional service levels throughout all areas of the company continuing to strengthen our customer relationships.  This is particularly important in a business environment like the one we have now.  ", "Here's Kurt to review the quarter's results.  ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Our earnings per share of $0.52 were at the low end of the range we provided last quarter reflecting today's tough economic environment.  I'll begin my review with the U.S. domestic package operations.  First quarter package volumes continue to be weak with little sign of the typical seasonal buildup prior to Easter.  ", "Volume gains from the departure of DHL from the U.S. domestic market only partially offset the impact of worsening economic conditions.  Package volume for the quarter declined 4.3% with ground down 5% and air down less than 1%.  Although we believe trade down in premium products have slowed a bit, DHL wins exaggerated the improvement.  In fact, excluding DHL gains, next day air volume declines would have been only moderately better than in the fourth quarter.  ", "The drop in revenue per piece resulted from the significant reduction in fuel surcharges as the lagging index caught up with declining fuel prices.  This was particularly apparent in the air products where fuel surcharges were down more than 15% year-over-year in the quarter.  ", "As I told you three months ago, when fuel surcharges rapidly escalated, we did discount base rates in some cases to preserve the surcharge.  We are cycling through the contract negotiation process to pullback some of these discounts.  However, today's economic environment does make this a bit challenging.  ", "Lighter average weight per package and changes in our product mix also contributed significantly to the revenue per piece decline.  For example, domestic package weights dropped 8% with next day air down almost 14%.  The shift in mix away from premium products negatively impacted yield as well.  These trends, along with a decrease in volume, eroded margins across all products.  And even though we've made substantial adjustments to our network, margins will remain under pressure until economic conditions improve.  We are managing our operations well in the face of declining volume.  ", "For example, labor hours and miles driven were both down over 5% and domestic block hours decreased about 6%.  Our cost initiatives are producing results also, excluding fuel, other operating expenses declined over 10%.  Our U.S. workforce has been reduced by more than 10,000 employees, 80% of whom are from the direct labor workforce.  However, savings in direct labor hours are being mitigated by the fact that wage inflation for this group has increased due to a higher percent of our employees at the full seniority rate.  ", "In the quarter, UPS expanded our service offerings to help customers better address their transportation needs.  We extended the guaranteed early morning delivery territory in the United States to more than 23,000 zip codes.  UPS now delivers overnight by 10:30 or earlier to more businesses in zip codes than any other transportation carrier.  Additionally, we also announced a new flexible returns program that allows consumers to return items shipped via UPS by placing them in their own mailboxes for pickup by the U.S. Postal Service to forward eventual transfer to UPS.  There is strong customer interest in this program.  ", "Before I move on to the international segment, I want to shed a little more light on the impact of DHL's departure from the U.S. domestic market and then comment on the retirement of our DC-8 fleet.  We are pleased with the results of our sales efforts targeted at winning DHL domestic business.  UPS captured a little more than half of the revenue, with the remainder split among our competitors.  ", "Although we pursued all DHL volumes aggressively, we put less focus on the lightest weight very low revenue packages.  Even so, DHL volume wins had an average weight that was just a little more than half the UPS average package weight.  Because the market recognizes the greater value we deliver to customers, we added this new volume at rates 10% to 15% higher than typical DHL rates.  ", "We did see some former DHL customers manage their shipping costs down by changing modes, and as a result UPS actually saw a greater increase in ground volume than air.  DHL volume came on stream throughout the quarter and there is still opportunity for additional DHL wins as we focus more on U.S. imports and exports leveraging our tremendous advantage in the U.S.  ", "Turning now to the early retirement of our entire DC-8 fleet, basically our air network requirements have changed.  Package volumes have declined due to the economy.  Our Worldport expansion allows more volume to be processed through this centralized hub and optimization of our network has reduced gateways and allowed us to close regional sorts.  ", "These factors, combined with the decision to not provide airlift for DHL packages, have made the DC-8 aircraft unnecessary.  Therefore, we are retiring the fleet earlier than planned, which will result in operating cost benefits going forward.  This is part of our ongoing efforts to modernize our air fleet which have given us the youngest most fuel efficient air fleet in the sector.  ", "Now, let's look at the international segment.  Volume declined 1% with domestic volume essentially flat and export volume down 1.8%.  The timing of Easter aided both products by about 2%.  Compared to the double-digit market declines, UPS again realized significant market share gains.  Revenue per piece, though, was down over 15% with currency having the most significant impact, although currency had a minimal impact on international operating profit as a result of our hedging activities.  ", "Excluding currency, revenue per piece was off 9.3%, the result of mix changes, reduced fuel surcharges and lower weights.  Package weight declines accelerated during each month of the quarter and this was evident in all regions, all industry sectors and across all products.  We anticipate that these trends will continue throughout the year.  ", "Operating margin for the segment was 13.1%, although lower than our historic levels, it is the best in the industry by far.  As we have mentioned in the past, our international cost structure is somewhat less variable than our US network, therefore, cost control in international is a very high priority.  The initiatives that we discussed in the last quarter are starting to produce cost savings in our network.  For example, international block hours dropped over 12% in the quarter, the largest reduction in our history without impacting our service footprint.", "Also our non-operating cost declined over 5%.  At the same time, we are aggressively pursuing the advantages created by our balance global network, and that's why we're seeing high bid volumes and bid wins among new customers while retaining current customers.  Our extensive product portfolio, paperless invoice and robust returns capabilities, and one contact person for all service types are driving our successful market penetration efforts.  ", "Turning now to the supply chain and freight segment, revenue was down almost 20% with all business units experiencing declines.  The operating margin of 2.3% was about what we saw in the fourth quarter despite the fact that both the global freight and LTL markets deteriorated during the quarter.  Forwarding and logistics experienced only minimal impact on operating margins as they successfully reduced cost commensurate with the decline in their revenues.  ", "New wins in the healthcare and high tech sectors helped to bolster the logistics unit.  Our continued investment in healthcare and expansion of our product offerings in this sector are paying off as we continue to attract new customers.  In a worsening LTL environment, UPS freight posted declines in revenue and tonnage but shipments per day were basically flat.  Growth did strengthen sequentially through the quarter, although pricing did not improve.  ", "We did capture new business through cross-selling activity and leveraging our investment in UPS freight technology.  We're experiencing increases in world ship deployments and in the number of daily shipments that are managed via our Quantum View visibility tools.  All in all, UPS freight realized share gains in the quarter, although this is certainly a case of less bad than most.  ", "Before addressing our expectations for the second quarter, I want to review our financial position.  Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, an increase of more than $200 million over last year, excluding the impact of tax refunds in 2008.  This increase was achieved through a significant reduction in capital expenditures and through excellent management of working capital.  ", "In the quarter, UPS invested $382 million in capital expenditures, spent $113 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares, and paid dividends of $449 million maintaining our $0.45 per share dividend.  Our intent for 2009 is to repurchase shares at a rate that will at least offset dilution from stock-based compensation.  At this point, sustaining the dividend is the higher priority than expanded share repurchases.  ", "Another financial highlight of the quarter was our successful $2 billion debt offering.  We offered $1 billion each in five-year and ten-year debt, both of which were substantially oversubscribed at coupons of 3.875% and 5.125% respectively reflecting UPS's broad access to markets at a low cost to capital.  Proceeds will be used primarily to retire commercial paper.  ", "And now for our outlook, current consensus forecast project economic conditions will worsen slightly in the second quarter with both GDP and industrial production expected to be a bit weaker than in the first quarter.  In addition, the timing of Easter will have a negative impact on second quarter results most notably in the U.S. and Europe.  ", "We anticipate that U.S. domestic package volumes will decline 4% to 6% versus last year with the lighter weight trends continuing until industrial production rebounds.  Domestic small package margins will be challenged due to mix ship, lower weight packages and reduced volumes.  International export volume is expected to decline about 3%, but we should see some margin expansion over the first quarter as a result of the segment's cost initiatives.  ", "The supply chain and freight segment is anticipated to show improvement in revenue and operating margin over the first quarter, but will still be below last year's results.  We remain vigilant about taking costs out of our operations.  In fact, we've identified additional initiatives that will produce approximately $300 million in savings bringing total savings from our initiatives to well over $1 billion for 2009.  ", "These initiatives span the entire enterprise and involve operational changes that increase efficiency, procurement improvements and better use of facilities, and they are in addition to the way that we manage our business on a daily basis.  ", "We've also further reduced our CapEx budget for the year by over $200 million bringing the total to just below $2 billion.  This budget still provides for capital investments in strategic growth opportunities like China, Worldport and our healthcare facilities in Puerto Rico and Europe.  Given all this, earnings per share should be within a range of $0.45 to $0.55 for the quarter.  This range reflects our expectation that the second quarter will be a bit more challenging than the first.  ", "Clearly, these are extraordinary times.  We're making the difficult decisions and implementing changes to respond to these unprecedented conditions.  At UPS we've managed through 20 recessions over the past 100 hundred years and we're confident that we will emerge stronger and more competitive when the economy turns around.", "With that, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Gary Chase - Barclays Capital. ", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Just a couple on the progression from the first quarter into the second, how would you define what the biggest challenge was?  Has it been the weight erosion to the quarter, because it looks like volumes came about in line with where you thought towards the bottom end of the range?  At one point you thought this second quarter would look up relative to the first.  So it feels like something sequentially changed as you moved through the quarter.  Was that just the weight issue or was there more to it?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Really, Gary, the trends across the first quarter were fairly stable.  January there was some challenges with weather.  It's a little noisy because the Easter holiday had a much bigger impact in the first quarter last year whereas it'll hit the second quarter this year.  So all in all, domestic trends I would characterize as very low but fairly stable.  ", "We do think the economic statistics will show a slight decline from Q1 to Q2, although the rate of rapid decline clearly seems to be stabilizing.  So the Easter impact puts a little bit of a headwind into Q2 versus Q1 and that's really the major difference and why we think Q2 will be modestly more challenging than Q1.", "Scott Davis", "Now the industrial production numbers, Gary, were obviously horrible in the first quarter and while clearly the declines won't be nearly as bad in the second quarter, we still expect them to decrease.  Whenever industrial production decreases, it will continue to challenge the weight of our packages which does put pressure on us.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Gary, one other comment I guess is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did complete a $2 billion bond issuance late in March and we're very pleased with the coupon rates we got, but we are going to see going from 30 or 40 basis points with the very attractive commercial paper rates a 400 plus basis point increase and interest expense on that.  So that alone adds another $25 million or so expense on the P&L side, although, clearly it locks in some great rates for a long time.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, then if you just look at the line items that, the cost line items that weren't effected by fuel, so you take out purchase transportation and obviously fuel expense, looks like those were down somewhere in the 5% to 7% range on a revenue decline of 13%, 14%, how far through the cost reduction process are you and what might that look like as you have more time to address this?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Gary, let me reframe that just a little bit.  We were down, yes, 6% or 7% in those non-fuel elements, although if you take out the write-off of the DCAs it's actually about 10%.  So that is implicit in the other category.  But this is against state decline and volume of about 4%, so yes revenue's down dramatically, but a big piece of that is fuel.  But we're working diligently on these cost trends and they do continue to get more significant over time.  ", "We did freeze management salaries.  That kicked in, in March.  We did show a dramatic reduction in block hours both domestically and internationally, much of that happened at the end of February.  So we're running full speed to match our network and our costs to demand.  And as things stabilize, clearly we'll catch up to some of that, but it's a challenge when you see these kinds of really unprecedented changes in the economic conditions.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Is there any way to say you're 50% through it, Kurt, 60%, 70%, 20%?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I'd be happy to put a number on it.  We're going to continue to pursue it and match whatever we can to the conditions.", "Scott Davis", "Gary, what's really going to drive the improvement I think is as we start seeing volume growth again, which will impact our effective labor wage rate.  As we've talked about many times in the past, two years ago we were running with an effective wage rate of 2% increases on much higher contract increases than we have today.  Today we're pushing more like 5% effective wage rate increases because of the, as Kurt mentioned in his comments, the seniority levels.  I think 88% of our employees now are at high seniority levels.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jon Langenfeld - Baird. ", "Jon Langenfeld \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "On the international side you talked about maybe slightly better margin in the second quarter, how does that balance off of the fact that it sounded like weight per shipment dropped throughout the quarter and then you also have Easter, I guess I would have anticipated maybe a little bit more challenging second quarter on the margin side versus first?", "Kurt Koehn", "Well, clearly the dramatic changes we've made in the air network, Jon, will continue to pay dividends.  Typically the second quarter is stronger than the first quarter internationally, although the Easter holiday has something to do with it.  So we're not looking for breakthrough quarter-to-quarter improvements.  We just feel that on balance the reduction in expense and management of our network will help to offset the slightly weaker volume demands.  ", "But we're working hard in that arena and, as we said, we've been very focused on managing costs in the last couple quarters internationally because for the past decade, we've had just nothing but very strong growth.  So we've had to shift gears a little, but we're very pleased with the progress.", "Jon Langenfeld \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and then on the additional cost savings side, is there anything new there or is it more of the same just at different levels of the organization?", "Kurt Kuehn", " ", "No, it's just continuing to look for opportunities with the unprecedented declines we've seen over the last couple of quarters in the economic conditions, it just brings us to looking at new areas and further adjustments in the network.  So with the air business probably being the best example as we take down the regional night sorts, concentrate volume through our automated building and Worldport, we find more and more opportunities.", "Jon Langenfeld \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, then the last question I have is just on the supply chain side.  When do you think the LTL business can get back to profitability?  Does it need a better environment or I mean if things stay where they're at for the next 12 to 24 months, will it continue to incur operating losses?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, Jon, I guess we're kind of in the LTL I guess to paraphrase Charles Dickens, \"It's the best of times and the worst of times.\"  We did take a large impairment last quarter and clearly are very disappointed at the need to do that, but we saw substantial improvement over the course of Q1 as our initiatives, as our technology integration with our customers really demonstrate to them that they can improve processes.", "So, as I said, we did get, shipments were actually up moderately in March and that's swimming against the tide we think because almost everyone of the competitors that have reported have talked about double-digit declines, at least in tonnage.  So we feel pretty good that we're building some momentum.  ", "We think we have a very unique value proposition in ease of use.  So we're not just waiting for the economy to improve in LTL.  We think we've got a company-specific opportunity that will show improving results, although clearly in today's environment, it's more challenging than it would normally be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz - JP Morgan.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "I wanted to get your sense of a little more on the cost side.  It seemed like you were a little reluctant to talk about how much you realized in first quarter, but is there a time in the year when you would expect to be at closer to the full run rate on those costs initiatives?  Do you reach that in second quarter or does it take a bit longer to get to that?  ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Tom, it's just a series of successive initiatives.  We initially built 500 million of specific operational initiatives, most of those rolled out by the end of Q1.  We did make compensation changes that began to kick in in March, and then this additional set of initiatives will be happening over the next couple quarters.   So if things continue to drop, we're going to continue to find new ways to adapt, to take costs out of our network so we operate effectively and can offer customers the best opportunity for value.", "Scott Davis", "Tom, there will be more initiatives as we go along.  As I mentioned in the past in the latest labor contract we agreed to with the teamsters, we have a competition committee that allows ourselves and the teamsters to get together and look at more flexibilities that make us more competitive.  And I think the relationships never been better, so I'm confident that team of people will come up with more ideas, better ideas as we move forward.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, so how do you think about how much of what you're taking out is fixed costs that won't come back when volumes improve and also the type of operating leverage you could show and margin improvement you could show if you look out a number of quarters and volumes stabilize and then begin to improve.  ", "Is this the type of thing where it's easy to see this type of sharp margin deterioration but then when you regain it, it will be very slow?  Or given some of the wage inflation it maybe works the other way, when you add part-time people and lower fixed costs base that type of thing you could really show some strong margin leverage coming out?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Tom, those are a lot of the things we're talking about in our forecasting meetings.  There's a lot of moving parts.  Some of the things are permanent changes.  The expansion of Worldport that allows us to operate a more efficient air network is a keeper.  We've added capacity there.  It's reduced the number of air craft in the sky.  It has allowed us to retire these 40 plus DC-8s.  Those are structural changes that will allow us to have both better service and substantially less cost.", "Some like the wage rates, depending on the rate of growth as it comes back, could kick in reasonably quickly.  Our seniority employees are seeing about a 2.5% wage increase, so the inherent inflationary concepts inside this contract are very favorable.  But as your growth slows and you don't bring in new employees, it mitigates the benefit of that.  So that will come in reasonably quickly.  And we've also made structural changes in our organization, reducing the number of districts we have and just trying to become more streamlined in our organization, so all of those will come over time.", "Scott Davis", "And that's half the equation, Tom.  The other half is the revenue side.  And clearly we've never seen industrial production numbers as bad as we saw them the last quarter and they won't be probably great this quarter.  But inventory levels are getting down to a bare minimum right now, and you're going to start seeing manufacturing, you're going to start seeing heavier products.  Whether its end of second quarter, third quarter I can't tell you exactly, but it's going to be a combination.  You're going to see the revenue mix get better and the labor mix get better.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And I guess there is one economic perspective that we also believe in even though we're being pretty cautious right now.  But there's a high correlation between the severity of a recession and the speed of the improvement, and given the dramatic declines into Scott's comments stop the inventory reductions, we think there is certainly a lot of latent potential for some rapid improvements when things start to turn the corner.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "If I can one more wrinkle on that.  Is it possible to see, I think you said inflation wage is up 5% when volumes are down so sharply on the seniority, is it possible to see a quarter where if volumes were up significantly that you could have wages effectively down due to mix?", "Kurt Kuehn", "You've painted probably a scenario there but that's probably at the extreme.  ", "Scott Davis", "There's certainly a dramatic decrease from what we're seeing today.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your next question will come from Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research. ", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "", "Why is your guy's domestic air business stronger than your ground right now?  You said it's not DHL.  That stuff's moving towards ground overall.  I mean, FedEx is seeing such a different experience.  Why is it that you're seeing that experience and then why is that mix hurting you so much because you gave the weight, a lot of different numbers for weight, but I thought I heard you say domestic package weight down 8, but that was before the DHL which is 50% lighter.  So I'm guessing the economy's not bringing it down 8, it's a combination of those things.  ", "So within that question I guess I'm asking you is, why for you are you focused on air?  Is that something that's going on or why such a different experience from FedEx and then talk about the weight in terms of what you gave versus if you adjusted that for the DHL mix?  ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Okay.  Let me try to separate those moving parts, Ed.  The stronger results in Q1 for the air are significantly impacted by the DHL wins.  Granted we won more net after customers migrated their shipping patterns we showed more volume increase to ground than air.  But the size of our relative operations, we have over 10 million ground shipments a day and only 2 million air shipments.  So on a percentage basis the air was much more heavily impacted by DHL.  So it's not anything dramatically unique there.", "Having said that though, we are very comfortable with the value proposition we can offer in the air.  I referenced today that we've expanded zip code coverage so we offer earlier deliveries than anybody else in the industry.  We've got a broader set of drivers that are out every day being able to cover middle market and extended areas earlier than our competition.   So the DHL impact clearly boosted the air results and that's why we want to be careful not to say that the challenges of the air are over.  It's just the relative impact was greater.", "The substantial reductions in weight we saw were also impacted by the DHL wins.  I don't have an exact number for you but we saw a substantial pickup in weight reductions.  Maybe a little less than half of that weight impact was probably driven by the DHL volume coming in to the network.  So it's a lot of moving parts right now and we did our best to capture the majority of the DHL opportunity. ", "We feel very comfortable that we got more than half of the revenue.  We did not focus as intensely on the very light weight packages, many of which might have come from airborne at home, but we do feel pretty good that the volume we got is profitable and as I said, we were able to show improvements in yield for the volume that we brought across.", "Scott Davis", "Ed, our manufacturing sector was down about 9% in the quarter, which clearly has a big influence on weight and relates directly to the IP numbers we were talking about.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "But I mean your total domestic volumes were not that weak considering what happened with DHL, and yet with your guidance your domestic margin's going to be even worse next quarter and this is the worst we've seen it as a public company, probably the worse since the strike before you were public.  So it implies that maybe you're taking the wrong mix or something's going on with this DHL.  How do we think about your volumes are down 4% and your margins are deteriorated dramatically more than that would imply.  Is there a pricing scenario as well that's out there that's getting more competitive?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, I think pricing is reasonably stable.  I did make some references to the fact that we do have still an ongoing process to kind of recalibrate following the spikes in the fuel surcharges.  And so there is some work going on to re-establish base rates that may have been deteriorated a bit with the pressure from 30% plus fuel surcharges.  ", "Ed, the second quarter is a combination of a modestly weaker economy.  We're now into a condition of a couple of years of negative growth, which creates some challenges.  We do have Easter hitting April that was not in there last year, and with the substantial declines in our growth the wage rate headwind is offsetting some of the productivity.  Most of those things we can work our way through over time, but we are cautious for the second quarter.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from William Green - Morgan Stanley.  ", "William Green \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Just a couple of quick detail questions, Kurt can you tell us what the B2B trends versus the B2C trends were?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "We saw challenges in both.  The B2C remains modestly positive and the B2B continues to be negative.  So those are really trends that are fairly steady from what we\u2019ve seen the last couple quarters.", "William Green \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I think it was in, I don\u2019t remember if it was 2007 or 2008 you talked about B2C being about 30%.  Is that still a safe percentage?", "Scott Davis", "", "Yes, the bill has been growing typically 1% of the 5 per year, so maybe its 31, 32 at this point in time.", "William Green \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay, and then you mentioned the package weights fell in domestic.  How did they do in international?  I really feel that DHL didn\u2019t affect that, but did the economic changes affect that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Absolutely, virtually the exact same trends domestically and internationally, lighter weight, customers coming to us asking, how can I reduce my budget, so in some cases we\u2019re helping them find ways to trade down within our portfolio.  So all of those factors are very similar and the scale of the changes are fairly similar, too.", "William Green \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay, and then was the LTL profitable in the first quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "No, it wasn\u2019t, it was underwater.  We\u2019ve got to get some continued momentum like we saw late in the quarter to get this thing back on track.", "Scott Davis", "", "We do expect improvements through the year in the LTL profitability.", "William Green \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay, and just one last question, U.S. import volumes, how did they trend in first quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "The trend wasn\u2019t dramatically different from January through March, although it was fairly weak.  We did see an aggregate for international, a softening over the course of the quarter, both in Asia and Europe.", "Scott Davis", "", "One change I think we saw in the first quarter in import is we did see China exports to the U.S. improve, which we had seen some weakness last year and we did see actually double-digit export increases out of China.", "Operator", "Your next comes from Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch. ", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Kurt, can you talk a bit about, you mentioning the employees being down 10%, I\u2019m sorry, 10,000.  If I remember you still have something, a couple hundred thousand that seems to be what 2% or 3%.  Can you give an update on the total employees and why are we not seeing that come off a little bit more as far as in line with kind of volume reductions over time?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Well, we have reduced hours actually in excess of volume reductions, over 5% reductions in hours against a 4% volume decline, Ken.  So the headcount numbers are a little more moderate, but the 10,000 for the U.S. operations would be 3% to 4% easily, and in the direct labor it would be closer, so, no, I think we\u2019re moving pretty quickly on that.  One of the nice things about how we operate is we do reduce the hours worked on a given day if volume is lighter.  It\u2019s not all a matter of just taking people off the payroll, so we flex and float and that\u2019s a nice attribute for both the company and our employees.", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "But I would imagine there\u2019s still a pretty sizable end fixed benefits and pensions and other expenses associated with that.  My follow-up is on the restructured operations.  You mentioned that you\u2019ve closed some regional hubs.  Is anything major closing, anything, New York or any major cities that you\u2019re shutting down that is a big part of the restructuring, or are these small branch offices?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Well, the biggest changes were in the elimination of two of our air night sorts in Dallas, Texas and Columbia, South Carolina.  In affect, with our expanded capacity in Louisville and the slow economy, were able to concentrate a much higher proportion of our volume through one hub.  So you have one aircraft going from a city rather than that city having to send volume to two or three hubs, so substantial benefits from that.  And then there\u2019s a number of operational changes all across the country and really the world, Ken, but not anything headline that would stand out as much like that.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse. ", "Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Can you give us a feel for the total capacity in your air network?  However you want to measure it and where you think it goes, post taking these planes out and maybe net of whatever new aircraft you\u2019re going to add back?  And then as a follow on to that, what does that mean for your capital plan on a normal basis as we go forward.  Does this mean you can spend less on a go-forward basis because you are effectively shrinking the air business?", "Scott Davis", "It\u2019s very difficult for us to respond to total capacity because each lane is different.  We certainly pay a lot of attention to the capacity in each lane and that's why we are adjusting and downsizing the network.  We are able to do it without reducing service and still save an awful lot of cost.  So I know that many times in years past we\u2019ve been asked the total capacity question.  It is very difficult because each lane is different, import/export\u2019s different.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, and you can fly multiple rotations.  I guess really the big thing we that have done is over the last seven or eight years we have taken out over 100 aircraft that are smaller and less efficient.  So we retired the 727 fleet that we had years ago, frankly, and the DC-8s, which are also at the smaller end of capacity, and we\u2019ve been replacing those.  We started the 757 replacement plan almost 20 years ago to take 72s out and we have 767s coming into the network that are taking the place of the DC-8s.  ", "So really what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019re way ahead of the curve on that.  As we said we\u2019ve got the most modern, youngest fleet in the industry.  The future capital requirements for replacements are nil, frankly.  The age of our fleet is in the low teens as far as years, and any new aircraft we bring in have larger capacity.  Because we\u2019ve invested $1 billion in expanding Worldport, we can fly substantially less aircraft but the aircraft are much bigger, much more efficient, and much more environmentally friendly.  ", "So it\u2019s a capital investment we\u2019ve made over the past several years that allows us to get lower CapEx in the future and substantial operating and environmental benefits.  So major change, tremendous benefits long-term, it\u2019s a great long-term investment for us and for the environment.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Justin Yagerman - Wachovia Capital Markets. ", "Justin Yagerman \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "I wanted to just get a better sense of the international package yield.  Can you give us a breakout of how much of the decline was currency, fuel, and mix?  And maybe go into a little bit of detail on were the currency fluctuations where that impacted that and how you hedge against them?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, the currency was a substantial factor and on page three of the web schedules we do breakout hopefully with enough transparency there, our results for yield without currency.  So whereas our overall international yields were down 15.3%, net of currency that\u2019s 9.3%.  And you can see the impact it had on both our non-U.S. domestics and export.  So the currency on revenue was substantial and it also had an impact within our forwarding group.  ", "We\u2019ve hedged much of that though with some favorable timing on hedging, primarily the euro and the sterling, a couple of years ago.  So the P&L impact of the precipitous decline in currency is modest.  It is still a little bit of a headwind but it has not impacted the P&L severely.  Certainly, the fuel surcharges that have plummeted also reduced our revenue in the international.  So there are the same pressures in our international yields of lighter weight and, to some extent, trade down to lower service levels that we see in the US.  But in general we\u2019re in pretty good shape in that, and our relative value proposition very high international.", "Justin Yagerman \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "", "And the currency hedge, that just gets submitted up into the EBIT number?", "Scott Davis", "It actually ends up a reduction of cost, which ends up coming into the operating income number, correct.", "Justin Yagerman \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "Okay, and then I guess on the LTL side, you guys talked about this a little bit, but tonnage was at least, the tonnage decline was not as bad as many of your competitors have come with and it looks like you guys are gaining some traction there.  Can you talk about some of the initiatives that you have taken with the product?  How you\u2019re competing in this marketplace, what types of benefits you may be seeing from a large ailing competitor, and what\u2019s going on maybe with length of haul in that segment?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we were less bad than most I guess, to torture that phrase.  No, we\u2019ve been working very hard to find the right value proposition in LTL that really brings something unique to customers, and we think we are getting to the point were we can work with LTL shippers, help them really get the best of both worlds.  The technology that is so productive in the small package environment has been harmonized to work easily in the LTL environment.  ", "Our new world ship allows customers to rate shipments both in small package terms and in LTL terms very easily, and then the visibility is there.  So the value proposition is getting to be very strong and we\u2019re pretty pleased.  We did see substantial market share growth, as we talked about.  We believe we are at about 8% market share so over the last several years we\u2019ve gained a couple of hundred basis points of market share.  We still want to want to be prudent though.  This is a tough environment.  ", "Our revenue per hundred weight net of fuel is positive, but it is very tough out there and so we\u2019re trying to strike a balance between market share gain and being disciplined in recovering the costs that we put in for the big investments.  ", "Scott Davis", "And, Justin, our package sales force, which is a large force, has done an excellent job of selling freight.  And that job has gotten much more effective over the last couple of quarters and is helping to drive that improvement and help performance.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company.", "David Campbell \u2013 Thompson, Davis & Company", "", "You mentioned that China was having a favorable impact on exports to the U.S. in the first quarter.  What about their import activity, which would have been the result of their own stimulus plans, have you seen any growths or any improvement in tonnage or shipments going into China?", "Kurt Kuehn", "In general, David, I think clearly the exports showed some improvement.  We\u2019ve not seen much move on the import side yet.  I think we hopefully will see a little bit more as that stimulus program takes place.  But generally our U.S. export numbers were disappointing in the first quarter and probably fell off dramatically from where they were the first half of last year.  I think that\u2019s typical of the export market right now out of the U.S.", "David Campbell \u2013 Thompson, Davis & Company", "And the second question is I guess Europe though is of course a bigger concern for you since you\u2019re bigger there and Europe is expected to recover behind the United States in your opinion?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think that likely, I think their a little bit slower on the stimulus programs from what I understand maybe a little more bank debt exposure than even the U.S. has.  So I think there\u2019s some risks in the recovery in Europe.  At the same time, we\u2019ve performed pretty well in Europe.  Our transporter products were still relatively strong in the first quarter.  ", "Our domestic products weren\u2019t bad.  Really, the international domestic though was driven mostly by Canada in the first quarter, but Germany wasn\u2019t too bad.  So I think they\u2019ll see some challenging times there, but our business still seems to be growing in Europe.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets.", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets", "", "When you look at, I know you\u2019ve said a lot about DHL on domestics, but can you add some color on what you\u2019ve seen as far as either core pricing or just market share gains on the international just based solely on kind of going after DHL customers I guess picking on their weakness?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, John, thanks for that question.  That is a top priority for us now and something that our people across the globe are very excited about, that UPS really has a unique capability these days with a substantial integrated presence in Asia, Europe, and the U.S. and the rest of the America\u2019s.  And so the value proposition we can bring to customers is the strongest it\u2019s ever been.", "And as I made brief reference to, we are seeing an increase number of successful bids and so we\u2019re pursuing our advantage across the globe and that\u2019s a chapter that\u2019s just now being written.  So we do feel very good that we can uniquely help customers reduce their cost and improve their global distribution and that\u2019s part of the reason your seeing these outsized market share gains.", "John Mins - BB&T Capital Markets", "", "Just as a follow-up, looking at the debt issue and the cash flow, I mean you generated so much cash and had such a large debt issue this year.  Could you tell me again what the impact on interest rates, the interest expense is going to be and what you\u2019re going to do with that 4 billion that you have sitting on your balance sheet now?", "Kurt Kuehn ", "Yes, the end of quarter balance sheet is a little bit exaggerated because we did secure the $2 billion of term debt at very favorable rates.  We also had a substantial commercial paper line and much of that commercial paper was 30-day plus term, so we are ramping that down.  The intent wasn\u2019t to load up on cash.  We will use that $2 billion of term debt to retire the commercial paper.  We just ended with some of that still terming through the end of the quarter.  ", "Scott Davis", "What\u2019s not exaggerated though is the 1.9 billion free cash flow, which really is outstanding and, as Kurt mentioned earlier, really 200 million more than a year ago, ignoring the tax refund, and that\u2019s despite a 45% reduction in income, so that\u2019s outstanding free cash flow.", "Operator", "", "Due to time constraints, we\u2019ll be taking our final question from David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus.  ", "David Ross \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "A question on the international side, you talked about, in domestic the trade down is pretty easy next day to second day, second day to ground.  You also talked about trade down in international portfolio.  Is that air to ocean?  Is that in Europe any way air to ground?  How do you look at that and what has been, I guess the biggest trade down offerings you\u2019ve seen?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Yes, I think within the forwarding there is some trade down between air to ocean, that\u2019s not as significant for us.  We do actually offer a forwarding portfolio of express freight, direct freight and consolidated.  So even within our forwarding platform we do offer different levels of service.  But the bigger, the more material impact for us is within our express network because we have an integrated air and ground capacity, we really can offer customers an array of choices.  ", "If you\u2019re flying from Asia to Europe for example, we don\u2019t have ground routes yet but we\u2019ll be working on that in the future, but you can fly to Europe and it can go that same night through our Cologne hub and be delivered at eight in the morning.  It can be slower but still by air, and then it can also get integrated into our transporter Europe network on ground.  ", "So, a lot of levers that can be pulled and also every one of those express premium products have a time of day commitment, so it\u2019s that seamless ability to move up and down both in North America and Europe that are really offering customers a way to adapt and save costs if that\u2019s a priority.", "David Ross \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "And then last question is I think, Scott, you mentioned protectionism risk at the beginning of the call and essentially called for a continuation of global trade.  Is there any areas around the globe that you see as more of a risk to protectionism that others?  ", "Scott Davis", "Well, I think that maybe we\u2019re our own worst enemy with that Buy American proposal that we came out with in the stimulus program and we\u2019ve backed off of that an awful lot and so I think it was not protecting us but it sent bad signals to the rest of the world.  So, clearly there are a variety of countries around the world that can look at the U.S. and say if they\u2019re going to talk protectionism, we\u2019re going to do the same thing.  ", "I\u2019m not going to name countries right now, but I think there are a variety of countries in both Asia and Europe that there are some concerns about it, but I do think common sense will prevail and people will realize how valuable global free trade is and protectionism will go away.  ", "", "Let me wrap up by saying, when Kurt mentioned earlier that UPS has managed through a remarkable 20 recessions in our history, that\u2019s a remarkable number.  But we\u2019re absolutely confident that we\u2019ll emerge form this economic downturn stronger, leaner, and more customer-focused than ever before.  In addition, we\u2019re now the only company with a truly integrated global network giving us, frankly, the best competitive position we\u2019ve had in years.

It\u2019s encouraging to see some economic forecasts like GDP and IP beginning to show consistent improvement. However, as Christina Romer, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, put it recently, \u201cTo say the economic recession is over is different than to say we\u2019ve recovered. While recovery has begun, it has a long way to go. Sustained economic gains will occur only when unemployment declines meaningfully.\u201d", "Turning to UPS\u2019s performance, business conditions early in the third quarter were similar to those in the second, though we did see improving trends as the quarter progressed. UPS also benefited from effective cost management. As a result, profitability improved over the previous quarter. ", "However, there are more opportunities to improve the way the business is performing. We are evaluating additional structural, network, and go-to-market strategy changes to enhance profitability. ", "One of UPS\u2019s international growth strategies has been to supplement export volume with profitable domestic volume around the world. Earlier this year we expanded express services into 16 additional countries, bringing the total number served to 50. We\u2019re seeing the benefits from this strategy with domestic volume up significantly in the quarter, aided by our recent acquisition in Turkey. ", "Affiliation with the international Olympic Games has broadened our brand recognition in the global community. We are honored and excited to have been selected to manage the transportation and logistical operations for the London games in 2012. This entails similar responsibilities to those we executed in the Olympic Games held last year in Beijing. These opportunities enable us to showcase on a global scale the breadth of our capabilities. We will bring the same expertise to the London games as we did to those in Beijing.", "Also in the quarter UPS stepped up, taking a leadership position to help improve the ability of global relief organizations to respond to emergencies. This multi-year initiative not only includes financial grants, but also puts our core competencies of transportation and Logistics management to work. Among the relief organizations that will benefit from this commitment are the Aidmatrix Foundation, the American Red Cross, CARE, UNICEF and the World Food Programme. ", "In line with our commitment to environmental improvement, two weeks ago UPS became the first small package carrier to offer carbon offsets to customers in the United States. Through this carbon neutral program shippers now have the option to offset the climate impact of their package shipments. In addition during the quarter, the Carbon Disclosure Project named UPS one of the top 50 companies in the world for transparency and high quality environmental disclosure practices. UPS is the only company in our industry to achieve this recognition.", "Before I turn the program over to Kurt, I want to take a moment to thank our employees around the world for their hard work in a very difficult economic environment. I know everyone has made a lot of sacrifices and I truly appreciate the dedication and teamwork.", "Heading into our peak season, I am confident that we have a finely honed organization, ready to execute flawlessly for our customers during this demanding time. As I look at the global business environment, I\u2019m encouraged that recovery is underway. UPS\u2019s worldwide presence and comprehensive portfolio of products and services and the international team of dedicated employees make a winning combination for our customers and investors alike.", "Now I\u2019ll pass the program to Kurt for specifics on the quarter.", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Thanks Scott and good morning everyone. Given the business environment that existed when we began the quarter, I thought it would be difficult to find a silver lining. Fortunately I was mistaken. ", "UPS did make progress compared to the second quarter. Volume was a little bit stronger, especially in International. And by managing the business effectively we earned $0.55 per share, at the top of the range we provided.", "Cost initiatives continued to generate significant benefits. Last quarter I told you that UPS would achieve $1.2 to $1.3 billion in savings this year. Given the success we\u2019ve had through the first nine months, we believe savings this year will approach $1.4 billion. Year-to-date we have saved $900 million. Going forward about two-thirds of these reductions are sustainable. Let me remind you that these savings are in addition to the gains we realized by managing our variable costs as volumes declined.", "Excluding fuel expense, operating costs for the quarter were down $683 million or 6.6% compared with last year. There are 17,000 fewer employees on our worldwide payroll than a year ago. Compensation expense excluding benefits, for the quarter decreased by 4.5%, reflecting productivity improvements and staffing reductions. These gains enabled UPS to narrow the gap between the percent decline in volume versus comp and benefit expense. ", "We continued to improve the efficiency of the UPS air network. Total block hours were down 10% allowing us to reduce fuel consumption by almost 9 million gallons.", "Consolidated operating margin remained at 8.3%, the same as last quarter, but down from 12.4% a year ago. Keep in mind that last year\u2019s third quarter had a substantial benefit from the timing lag of the fuel surcharge.", "In addition, you\u2019ll see that our effective tax rate for the quarter was reduced to 34.8%. We expect to see similar rates through next year.", "Now let\u2019s start our review with the U.S. package operations. For the quarter, total domestic volume was 799 million pieces, down 3.6%. Total volume is more indicative of the year-over-year performance than average daily volume in this third quarter. Here\u2019s why. UPS operated on Friday, July 3 and included it as an operating day. Volume on that day was substantially lower than average. Counting this as an operating day resulted in an average daily volume decline of 5.1%. The Domestic Package environment is actually better than this number implies.", "Ground daily volume was down 6%. However, we experienced a 2.5% increase in next day volume. This was the first time in almost two years we\u2019ve seen growth in our next day products. Volume improved sequentially through the quarter, driven by both seasonality and some economic recovery.", "Revenue per piece was down over 9%. The decline was driven mostly by reduced fuel surcharges versus last year, 29% lower on air and almost 7% lower on ground products. Although package weights improved from the second quarter, they were still down about 7% from last year. Changes in product mix also contributed to the decline in revenue per piece. Despite these ongoing trends, operating margin improved 7.5%, up 50 basis points compared to second quarter.", "The current pricing environment remains challenging, driven by the economy and more specifically by our customers own margin pressures. As we\u2019ve told you in the past, UPS solutions help our customers take costs out of their supply chain well beyond just the cost of the transportation service provided. It\u2019s critical that we at UPS convey the true value of these services. Therefore a top domestic priority today and into 2010 is improving our package yields. Our intention is to drive yield improvements from existing customers that did not provide a fully adequate return. Results from these efforts will become more meaningful as we progress through next year.", "UPSers managed operations well despite reduced volumes. Once again labor hours, miles driven and domestic block hours all declined by a greater percent than the percent of volume declines with productivity gains across the board. We are now down 13,000 people in our U.S. direct labor force. The benefits from productivity improvement and reduced headcounts were mitigated somewhat by a higher average hourly wage rate, healthcare inflation and increased pension expense. ", "Let\u2019s move now to the International segment. Signs of recovery emerged in the third quarter. Export volume declined only 3.2%, less than the market and less than the 4% to 6% we had anticipated three months ago. We did see sequential improvement in export volumes across all regions of the world compared to the second quarter. ", "Average daily domestic volume was up 9%. A portion of this improvement was contributed by our acquisition in Turkey, which was included in results for only two months of the quarter. But even without the impact from this acquisition, domestic volume growth turned positive with particular strengthening in the UK, Germany, France, Poland and Canada. ", "Excluding the effects of currency, revenue per piece declined 17.5%, primarily the result of reduced fuel surcharges. Changes in product mix and volume shifts across global trade lanes were also contributing factors. ", "Despite the reduction in volume and revenue, operating margin for the segment was 12.9%, essentially flat with last quarter and with last year. This remains by far the best in the industry.", "UPS International is also doing a great job with cost management and generating positive operating leverage around the world. International block hours dropped by almost 15% in the quarter without impacting our service footprint. UPS remains committed to controlling costs while still making the strategic investments to enable growth when economic conditions improve.", "Turning now to the Supply Chain & Freight segment, even though revenue was down almost 20%, all business units experienced moderation in the rate of decline. Operating margins remained ", "", "Operating margins remain at 5.5%, similar to last year. We maintained margins through successful cost control and effective revenue management.", "Our Logistics Group posted a solid performance. Margins were strong due to operational efficiencies and good contract management. We believe there is opportunity for margin expansion as we streamline our processes and rationalize our service offerings.", "In forwarding, revenue and profitability improved while operating margin was flat with last quarter. Global airlift capacity constraints have begun to squeeze industry margins. Taking advantage of our unique position as both an airline and a forwarder will enable us to reduce this margin pressure. ", "Also contending with very weak market conditions, UPS freight reported a modest 1.7% decline in LTL shipments. Despite the challenging operating environment, this business outperformed the market and maintained yields. The already weak LTL pricing environment deteriorated in the third quarter. UPS freight, though, opted to maintain its price discipline to the extent possible to ensure payment for value. This decision has resulted in the loss of some shipments and tonnage. Nevertheless, we believe this is the best strategy to preserve yield and the long-term health of the business. LTL revenue per hundredweight declined 6% and would have been positive without the impact of the fuel surcharge. In addition, our price index firmed slightly from the second to the third quarters. ", "Strong cash flow distinguishes UPS's business model. For the first third quarters of 2009, free cash flow was $3.4 billion, flat with last year after excluding the impact of tax refunds in 2008. This is a strong result considering that we contributed over $500 million to pension plans in the third quarter.", "For the first three quarters of this year, UPS also invested $1.2 billion in capital expenditures, spent $396 million to repurchase 7.8 million shares, paid dividends of $1.3 billion, and finished with $2.8\u00a0billion in cash and marketable securities. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for the full year will be $1.7 billion. This is down about $250 million from the last projection we provided you and down about $0.5 billion from our initial budget of $2.2 billion. This will put us below 4% of revenue this year, even after adding capacity in our global hub network.", "Looking forward, we expect to benefit from reduced interest expense as a result of a swap program that we initiated earlier this year that converts fixed-rate debt to floating. During the third quarter this program reduced our effective borrowing rate by approximately 40\u00a0basis points. We should see some additional benefits as this program continues.", "Looking at fourth quarter operations, our customers have widely differing views regarding peak season volumes this year. Let's say we have a healthy mix of bulls and bears. Overall, though, for the quarter we expect to see firming in U.S. volumes relative to the third quarter but still below last year. Operating margins should be similar to third quarter results. ", "In our International segment we expect our export volume and operating margins to improve modestly over the third quarter, but we'll still be down from last year also.", "The Supply Chain & Freight segment revenue trends should improve compared to third quarter results but remain below last year. We do anticipate operating margins should be similar to what we saw in the third quarter, which is substantially above last year.", "Based on our expectations for stronger sequential operating results in the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share should be within a range of $0.58 to $0.65. ", "We'd now be happy to answer your questions.", " ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Can you first just maybe bucket the cost savings that you have been talking about and talk about which of those buckets will tend to be more permanent than others?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Jon, we have been taking a look at that and trying to get a good sense of really what is sustainable.", "There are some things that we did certainly in the short term given the emergency and the condition we saw in the economy, like freezing salaries, that frankly I hope we won't have to continue going forward, so some of those things. We've done some reductions in advertising; we did freeze salaries - some quick things just to stabilize the results. And those things presumably will go back to normal as the economy returns.", "But we've also done a lot of hard work to realign the network and are harvesting the benefits of that that will stay. We have continued to shrink our infrastructure of operating units both in the U.S. and across the globe to reduce some of our SG&A. As you know, we've opened up the first phase of our Worldport hub expansion that's allowed us to reduce the number of aircraft we use in our Domestic network substantially by retiring our DC-8s. That will continue to provide benefits. And we've also made a lot of creative changes in how we operate.", "So we do think about two-thirds of these savings will be sustainable, at least in the medium term.", "Scott Davis", "Jon, I would add that I think we'll have additional savings. We've done an awful lot of things on the network that we see more opportunities in the future. And with the expansion of Worldport, the final piece of that being completed next year gives us more opportunity to generate more network savings. So we're not done generating savings, also.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "And then the second question was on the ground volume side. I understand the days adjustment that you'd mentioned, but most of the freight environment that we've seen has shown a noticeably less negative trend, whether it's rail, whether it's trucking freight, truckload, less than truckload, ocean liners. I'm a little bit surprised we didn't see more movement on the ground business sequentially from the developments in the second quarter. Any thoughts on that front?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, if you factor out the working day effect, that we divided by one extra day than some of the market, that gets us probably closer to about a 4.5% decline, which is a sequential 1% improvement in the ground. And we saw a little better sequential improvement later in the quarter, July both for the holiday and just the results were pretty bleak. ", "So it is what it is. We did see modest improvement, both because of seasonality and we think some because of sequential improvements. We're not trying to say that things have gone fully back to recovery, but we did see some strength in that.", "And typically the small package ground lags some of your heavier modes and your express in a recovery a little bit if there's some urgency for restocking.", "Scott Davis", "I think, clearly, as you head into October and November, that was kind of the worst case last year, when there was somewhat paralysis and the financial crisis. So the comps get much easier in October and November. We had a pretty good Christmas season the two weeks before Christmas, but up until then it was a pretty weak fourth quarter. So comps get easier going forward. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Gary Chase - Barclays Capital.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "A few questions on fuel, the topic that seems to be increasingly on people's minds these days for obvious reasons. First, we saw a lot of trade down in the air business as fuel prices peaked. I'm wondering as you talk to customers how they're thinking about the thought that seems to be front and center in just about everything you read, that energy is going to accompany any upside movement in the economic trend. Are you getting any feedback to suggest there might be more trade down coming?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, I think if anything we're seeing a little bit of the opposite right now. The last year third quarter had 29% higher fuel surcharges than what we had in the third quarter of this year, so we're actually seeing tremendous stability and, in fact, you are seeing our air products show some resilience. So at least at the current levels, where you do have surcharges that are significantly below last year, and the gap between air and ground is fairly modest, we're seeing if anything really no signs of continued trade down. I think we mentioned last quarter that we'd seen that stabilize. ", "Clearly with fuel heading back up to $80 or so today, there will be some short-term headwinds for us with the lag of the fuel surcharge, in dramatic contrast to the tailwind we got last year. But our sense is unless fuel climbs another, I don't know, $15 a barrel or so, it's unlikely that those surcharges will be too detrimental to demand. And hopefully, if the economy continues to pick up, that'll be outweighed by the need for rapid replenishment of inventories. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "And as a follow up, you talked in the past about the discounting of base rates during this process of fuel peaking. Were the surcharges largely intact so as energy prices move we should expect pretty good surcharge coverage looking forward?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Certainly compliance is higher with fuel surcharges in the single digits than it was when it went through 30%. That really created some tremendous pain for our customers and a lot of pressures on us for incentives. So we do see higher compliance rates right now. But, as I said in my prepared comments, yield management and making sure that we extract the value for the services we perform is one of our absolute top priorities in the domestic environment.", "We are seeing base rates up modestly if you factor out fuel and other factors. But it's still not a level we think it should be, and that'll continue to be a priority for us.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "I wanted to see if you could give us some perspective on the impact of currency. We estimate something like 10% of your revenue comes from your Europe business, and obviously you've seen a pretty sharp move of dollar weakness recently. It seems like there'd be a natural benefit there, but I know you're active with hedging. So I wonder if you could just take us through how dollar weakness potentially affects your International profitability and also kind of the timing of that impact in light of your hedging?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, well for Q3 currency was a headwind. If you recall last year, the euro spiked up significantly higher than it was in Q3. So currency was a headwind for us in the third quarter.", "Scott Davis", "The dollar actually weakened late in the third quarter. It's going to help us in the fourth quarter, but not much in the third. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "It will show certainly a strengthening coming into Q4, but Q3 was a headwind.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "I guess I was thinking more in terms of 2010. If the dollar stayed at $1.50 to the euro or weakened further, just kind of how to does hedging offset the benefit or would you pretty clearly get a margin benefit and a translation benefit in 2010 if the dollar keeps weakening?", "Scott Davis", "Tom, we've talked about this a lot in the past. We are hedged in 2010, and we would not expect a negative comparison based on our hedging position we have right now. And we have some upside, too. We deal with collars, but we have quite a bit of room on the upside. So we're positioned very well for 2010.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "We've heard about strengthening air freight out of Asia on the heavyweight air freight side; we heard about a spike recently in China. Does that follow through that you would see some good pickup in your parcel side out of Asia? Do you see a spike there as well, or do you think that's kind of decoupled from what's happening on the heavyweight side?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, we did see some sequential firming really across the world and Asia through September. The most notable event that's happened, which really confirms what you're saying, is the last several weeks we have seen a significant firming of demand on the air freight side. So things are very busy on the air freight side.", "I think it's too soon to call whether that'll ripple through as substantially in the package. But the combination of us having both the air freight and the package and the hard assets of the aircraft allows us to prosper, really, from either one of those two.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Can you just talk a bit about on this air and ground divergence here. In past downturns have you seen the dichotomy get this wide, where you're seeing the express run up so much more in advance of ground?", "Scott Davis", "I think if you look historically, Ken, you do see air have more leverage, both positive and negative. So that isn't totally surprising. There is certainly also more impact from the DHL departure from the U.S. market on the air business, so I don't want to draw too strong a point on it. ", "But on the other hand, also, this recession is much different than some of the ones in the past. Inventory levels are very low. We think it's premature to say that restocking is a dramatic part of that. But it is an interesting time for that, and we're going to be continuing to watch that closely.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Then just secondly on the LTL segment, I know it's small but the weight per shipment really dropped very significantly this quarter relative to where you were. Is there something driving that business, because it seems to have impacted the profitability a bit there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, we're pretty pleased with our operating results on the UPS freight. Clearly, the industry is still struggling dramatically. We do think there's some cannibalization of the heavier weight shipments going to truckload.", "I think another big part of it is that our go to market strategy of targeting the very large base of UPS customers, most notably in the middle market, is paying off, and they tend to have lighter weight shipments. But that's obvious in our yields, our revenue per hundredweight just down 6%. That would have been up 4% positive just taking fuel out of the equation. ", "So we feel very good that we are seeing very good discipline on the yield side and continuing to outgrow the market on our shipments.", "Scott Davis", "I think the key to us getting weights back across the board in our products is industrial production. And even though we're starting to see it strengthen and the third quarter was positive quarter-over-quarter, it was still down almost 10% year-over-year. ", "Now, we're optimistic going forward that IP will actually perform GDP as it comes back, but it's got a long ways to go to get back to 2007 levels. That will help our weight.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research.", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Just kind of big picture, if I look at the Domestic Package OR it's worse than I would have expected down here, and probably the International's holding up a bit better. And it just feels like the Domestic Package volumes have weakened and the margin's not improving like the other margins are. Is that a fair way to think about it, that the mix, as ground shrinks and the air maybe from some of the DHL stuff and so forth grows, that it's tougher to get this margin back to where it was historically? And is there a plan to start to work on that mix and kind of focus on the ground a bit as you go out longer term?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we continue to be very focused on managing this domestic environment, Ed. We are seeing still a headwind on our average weights. Weight's down about 7%. ", "And maybe to follow up a little more on the ground trends, the ground is significantly impacted by this industrial and wholesale environment, as Scott mentioned. That's part of why you're seeing a little bit of a lag. We are seeing some firming in the economy, but it's not showing up substantially in industrial production. That really makes that ground product and our Domestic business move heavily.", "If you look, though, sequentially, quarter to quarter we actually improved margins from Q2 to Q3, Ed. And historically those margins dropped, say, 40 - 50 basis points sequentially. We actually improved them 50 basis points. So we're pretty confident that the aggressive cost management we're doing and the firming of yields that's beginning to take some impact are actually kicking in and that we do feel that the Q3 performance was better than Q2. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "As a follow up, on the International domestic side, volumes are up quite a bit relative to last quarter. Can you talk about how much of that's acquisition and what else is driving that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, there's really three factors driving that, and it is a substantial difference than the negative results in Q2. First is that we did see some sequential firming in our major markets. The U.K., Germany, France, Poland, Canada, all of them, both our execution on market share gains and we think some stability in the market helped us generate positive growth in those countries. ", "In addition, as Scott mentioned, we have expanded our domestic services, added another 16\u00a0countries. We've found we can effectively layer in domestic express services in some of these smaller countries where we offer export services.", "And then third is the inclusion of the Turkey numbers in our results. Turkey is a substantial economy, and it did take us from being just slightly positive to substantially positive. We will continue to see the benefit of that and are excited about having that extra capability in our portfolio.", "Scott Davis", "I think the one area that I was surprised with was Europe. I think on previous calls I've said I've been a little more optimistic on Asia and probably the U.S. export than I have been in Europe, but we did see surprisingly good improvement in Europe, as Kurt mentioned - good growth in German, France, the U.K.'s shown some improvement. So, again, I'm not quite as bearish on Europe as I was on previous calls. It's looking better. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Did I hear right - it's 9 points of improvement from the acquisition give or take?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, we would have been modestly positive without that, so it's a little less than that.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from William Greene - Morgan Stanley.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Just a couple of data questions. Can you tell me what the U.S. import volume trends look like and what B2C volume trends look like as well in the quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Import U.S. improved modestly, still remain negative. Import and export U.S. are both about the same right now; we're not seeing a big move either way.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Sorry, Kurt, did you say improved modestly year-over-year?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, no.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "That was sequential?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Over the course of the quarter - it's still negative year-over-year. We haven't seen a big move in U.S. imports or exports.", "Certainly the U.S.-Asia numbers are firming a little better than what we saw for the U.S. and Europe relationship.", "Scott Davis", "", "And I think other than that that the Europe exports to the U.S., obviously, are weak with the weakness of the dollar.

Can you just say a bit about what's going to drive that, please?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, I think seasonally Q4 is typically a better quarter for us than Q3, so we do expect to see some modest margin improvements from that. Plus we are seeing modest firming, we think, in trends across the world. ", "And frankly, Robin, we continue to be very optimistic that we're gaining market share. I mean, UPS remains very focused. We've got a strong business model and some very large points of differentiation having a balanced capability across the world, so we're looking for continued market share growth, continued improvements in margins, and are pleased with our progress in that arena.", "Robin Byde - HSBC", "Is this market share gain mainly in Europe domestic?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No. It's the international export numbers. We've continued to dramatically outperform the industry by just about any measure. We think that we are continuing to do that.

", "Scott Davis", "I think, Nate, that our strategy is sound, and I'm a firm believer that global trade is going to lead us out of this recession that we're in. So I think UPS is positioned extremely well, and I think our focus on the products we're looking at today - the international products, the domestic products\u00a0 I think puts us in a very good position to participate in the growth.

But we feel very good that we've successfully made that transition. ", "Domestic market share, that's pretty much stable, but the focus on international products against DHL continues to be a top priority for us. They are the market leader in much of Asia and Europe, and so we feel very comfortable competing with them. The value proposition of technology, service and quality that UPS offers stands up very well with them, and that continues to be one of the catalysts for our outperformance internationally.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "And I guess along those lines, as we look at the free cash flow generation that you guys have been able to achieve and you think about an emerging recovery hopefully in the overall economy, when you start thinking about opportunities and acquisitions out there for you guys, I guess it'd be interesting to hear you talk about, I know you break down different geographies in terms of whether or not you think they're mature or opportunities, and maybe if any of those geographies have changed one way or the other and have become more attractive or less attractive.", "And then maybe conceptually what types of acquisitions you're going to be looking for as we move into this environment, and if any of them are large scale or if you think that you're more in a tuck-in mode on a go forward basis.", "Scott Davis", "I think our strategy has not changed much. I think we've been active right through the recession. You've seen us doing a lot of acquisitions in the last 12 months, including Korea. We talked about Turkey - Romania, Slovenia. So we've been pretty active in that front. There's certainly been a lot of focus on Eastern Europe, a lot of focus still on Asia. ", "I think our priorities still are international package. I think that'd be our first priority, where we'd do our acquisitions. ", "I've said in the past that I wanted to see our forwarding units start generating better margins before we got back in the market. We've made a lot of progress in that area. You're starting to see the margins improve. You're starting to see us get close to generating an economic profit in those arenas, so it's more realistic that we'll look in that arena again moving forward.", "But primarily we'd lead with international package, some interest in the supply chain arena, focused on forwarding, geographies still probably Asia, Mid East, Eastern Europe would lead the way. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.", "David Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.", "I just wanted to clarify the international situation, where you mentioned increasing demand, shortages in capacity in some markets, therefore, as a forwarder, when you're buying capacity you may get squeezed; as a cargo carrier you'll benefit from the higher yields. Do you think the rates will go up as fast as the cost of purchase in transportation markets as a forwarder? Do you think your rates will match those cost increases?", "Kurt Kuehn", "David, there clearly is a challenge in the forwarding industry right now. We saw a little bit of that in Q3 with margins beginning to tighten a little bit. So, no, I think there is an expectation that the forwarders will have to adapt to increasing demand and increasing rates. That's just part of the cycle you live through.", "We do think that with our unique position of both our assets and other assets we've got some options to route volume in a way that gives us a unique opportunity economically, and so we're looking forward to that challenge. ", "But we have seen, as I said, the last probably three, four weeks in Asia some real uptick, most notably on the high tech side, with goods being exported on the freight side. So that's a good sign, and we'll adapt. It may hurt us a little bit on the margin side, but it's good news overall.", "David Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.", "If demand is so strong, why is it that shippers won't match the increases in costs because they want to get their product out?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, we'll see. There's usually a lag but that's certainly our priority, you know, to make sure that we stay on the right side of this dynamic. But it's pretty typical as you see cycles work in forwarding that there's some margin compression on the way up.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse.", "Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse", "It seemed like that you didn't get all that much leverage as you walked from Q2 to Q3. Revenues were up, but the increase in operating profit on the back of that increase in revenue was relative small. Can you give us some feel for why that may be? Is it fuel? Is it mix? And then is this the kind of contribution, something around 10% or 11%, that we should expect as revenues increase sequentially going forward?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, Chris, Q3 typically is a challenging quarter. Internationally, it tends to be one of the low quarters because there's significant vacations in August in Europe, and Europe is certainly a heavy quarter for us. And even domestically, the third quarter typically is a little less profitable than the second quarter, as we talked about.", "We did see, I guess, a drag in our International segment, both from currency changes and fuel\u00a0-- modest drags but that was a drag. And on a year-over-year basis clearly there were huge comps. ", "So we're pretty pleased actually that we operated effectively. We didn't knock it out of the park in the third quarter, but we are seeing excellent operating results, continued reductions in cost, and feel pretty good that we actually overcame the normal seasonal downturn from Q2 to Q3 with our results.", "Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse", "Then one big picture question: Have you seen any evidence, either in the U.S. or internationally, of small business owners opening new accounts with UPS? I think you'd mentioned in the past that that can be a lead indicator that the economy is starting to get better.", "Scott Davis", "I think we're seeing some of that, but I think Kurt summarized the conditions pretty well. There's still a mix out there. There's still some people who want to see a little more recovery, and we're in the early stages of it. ", "Obviously, we're seeing some new small business customers coming in but still not at the rate we'd like to see to know this is absolutely a sustained recovery.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets", "Back to your comments about China domestic and your expansion possibilities there. It seems like you get a rule change a month or so from the Chinese government as to what can only be handled by China post and that type of thing. Has that influenced you at all in terms of timing and pace at which you would look to move into that market?", "Scott Davis", "I think it's something that all the international companies are concerned about, the new postal law that went in October 1st. We're still going to have great interest in competing domestically in China. ", "We've had actually great success with the Chinese government on the import and export and getting the rights, the plane rights that we have for our new hub, Shenzhen, in Shanghai. So the relationship has been good. ", "We're patient, and we think there'll be some good opportunities going forward.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets", "And then as you look at the fourth quarter you normally do a fair amount of, I guess, part-time hiring in the fourth quarter for the holiday season and that type of thing. Given where volumes are and that type of thing - and I would imagine some capacity in your system - is there any need to do much of that at all in the fourth quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, John, we do expect to continue to do that. I actually started with the company as a temporary hire for Christmas, and we're estimating about 50,000 jobs that will be added for the seasonal growth. That's a little below what we normally do, but we're still looking. Even if numbers come in at the low range of expectations for holiday shopping, it's still a big increase over the normal time of year. ", "And as I mentioned, there is a pretty wide divergence of opinions. We're seeing some of the brick-and-mortar players be fairly conservative, but there's a number of the dot com players that are expecting substantial increases. So we'll see how that battle of the bulls and the bears turns out.", "Andy Dolny", "That concludes our Q&A today. I'm now going to turn the program over to Scott for some concluding remarks.", "Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Let me make a couple of comments just regarding economic conditions. ", "I tend to be an optimistic by nature yet a realist by experience. And on balance I believe this recovery is real, but it's still fragile. I believe it's sustainable but vulnerable, at least for the foreseeable future.", "But I firmly believe that global trade will lead it rather than lag it. And one thing I know for certain - UPS is at the forefront of global trade and is going to help lead the way. ", "Thanks so much for joining us today.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.

(Operator Instructions)  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr.\u00a0Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead.", "Andrew Dolny", "Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call.  I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and our outlook for 2010.  ", "Before we begin, however, I will review the safe harbor language.  Some of the comments we'll make today are forwardlooking statements that address our expectations for the company's future performance or results of operations.  These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2008 10K, and 2009 10Q reports.  ", "These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.  ", "In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will compare results for 2009 and 2008, excluding the effects of adjustments that occurred in both years.  Such a comparison is more reflective of UPS' true performance.  The adjustments in 2009 that I am referring to include charges of $258\u00a0million during the first half relating to the acceleration of the retirement of aircraft and the remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated obligations.  ", "In the fourth quarter of 2008, we took impairment charges of $575\u00a0million in our UPS Freight unit and in the International segment.  A reconciliation of these results is included with our earnings announcement this morning and appears on UPS\u2019 IR website in the financial information tab.", "In addition, Kurt will refer to UPS' free cash flow, which is a nonGAAP financial measure.  Reconciliation is included with the news announcement this morning and is available on the Investor Relations website.  Before I turn the call over to Scott, a reminder.  During the questionandanswer period, please limit yourself to one question and one followup.  Now here's Scott.", "Scott Davis", "Good morning, everyone.  Several times over the last year, I shared with you my conviction that UPS has the ability to manage effectively in response to changing market conditions.  That certainly proved true in 2009.  UPS has emerged from a very difficult year leaner, more focused, and better positioned to take advantage of improving economic trends.  Let me illustrate.  ", "During 2009, UPS improved operating efficiency through a comprehensive costmanagement effort.  We demonstrated the nimbleness of our international business unit by quickly adjusting our network to match volume levels and ending the year with operating margins that are near historical norms.  ", "UPS bolstered our technology leadership with the introduction of new mobile shipping applications and the expansion of our WorldShip platform by adding the ability to ship air freight as well as small package and LTL.  Our investment for growth continued around the world through new construction in China that will facilitate global trade, facility expansions like Worldport that create network efficiencies, and acquisitions that strengthen our presence in growing markets.", "We took our service performance to even higher levels and continued to build upon our environmental commitment as evidenced last week when we were ranked number nine among the top 100 global companies in Maplecroft's Climate Innovation Index.  ", "Lastly, once again UPS produced cash flow and margins that are the best in the industry; and we're not standing still.  We're in the process of streamlining our U.S. small package structure.  This effort is about improving how we go to market and interact with our customers.  It's also about being more efficient with our resources to generate better returns in our domestic business.  It will enable us to reduce costs and move market and resources and decision-making closer to the customer.  ", "This restructuring has been in the planning stages for quite some time and would have happened regardless of the business environment.  Over the last few years, UPS has greatly expanded the breadth and depth of the solutions we offer.  Through this new structure, we now have the opportunity to better deliver the value our solutions bring to small and mediumsize customers.  That's what's driving this change.", "It will take some time the see the full impact of our new structure.  But in the long run, this may prove to be one of the most significant changes to our domestic business in quite some time.  ", "On a different note, the fourth quarter marked the tenth anniversary of UPS' IPO.  Going public has helped the company in a number of ways.  It affords us greater financial flexibility since we no longer have to support a closely held stock.  And the IPO introduced a new voice at the table, outside investors.  ", "While it's been a turbulent decade in the stock market, since the IPO our total return to shareowners has outperformed the S&P 500.  Over the last ten years, our brand has become truly global as we expanded our presence around the world.  ", "Before Kurt reviews our fourth quarter results, I want to take a moment to thank UPSers for their flawless execution and cando spirit during our peak season.  Everyone should be proud of what they accomplished.  I also want to say that our hearts go out to those suffering from the earthquake in Haiti.  UPS has responded.  Along with our partners in the logistics emergency team's coalition that supports the U.N. World Food Programme, we are providing transportation and logistics services to help manage the massive recovery effort.", "Looking to 2010, I'm optimistic about the future.  Recovery is under way in many regions of the world, but it will be gradual.  I firmly believe global trade will be a major stimulus that powers economic recovery.  And UPS is better positioned today than ever before to make that happen.  Let me turn the program over to Kurt.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone.  2009 was challenging to businesses worldwide.  I'm pleased with the way in which UPS wrapped up the year, but I for one am glad that the year is over.  ", "For the quarter, earnings per share of $0.75 were a substantial increase over our original guidance.  That increase was achieved through higher volumes than expected and a wellexecuted game plan.  As Scott said, UPSers did a great job, particularly during the peak holiday season.  ", "Other noteworthy highlights\u00a0\u2013 first, tremendous results from the International segment with a 6% gain in revenue, producing a 19% increase from operating profit.  Second, substantial improvements in our U.S. package segment.  Although we have a long way to go, domestic profit increased over 60% from its low point in the second quarter.  Third, despite the worst economic environment in 70 years, UPS' free cash flow for the year was exceptional, $4.1\u00a0billion or over $4 per share for only the second time since going public.  ", "As you can see from fourth quarter results, the benefits from our cost initiatives are becoming increasingly evident.  For example, in the quarter total compensation and benefits grew at a much slower pace than volume increases.  Also of note in the quarter, we saw a clear demonstration of the value inherent in our broad portfolio of services.  ", "Unexpected demand for air freight in Asia exceeded market capacity, squeezing margins in our forwarding business.  However, our International Package segment benefited from the increased volume as UPS customers upgraded into our Express network.  This is the unique advantage of an integrated portfolio.  ", "Now let's start the review with the U.S. Package business.  In the fourth quarter, we again saw growth in average daily air volume with Next Day Air up almost 3% and Deferred up over 4%.  Growth decline for Ground moderated in the quarter.  ", "Revenue per piece was down 5.2% primarily as a result of lower fuel surcharges.  Air and ground fuel surcharges were down yearoveryear approximately 16% and 4%, respectively.  Weight per piece down about 5% had a bit less of an impact than in previous quarters.  And base rate pricing, my number one priority heading into 2010, improved sequentially.  ", "Typically, operating margin in the fourth quarter is less than in the third.  However this was not the case in 2009.  The segment's 10.1% margin was an increase of 260 basis points over our third quarter results, and the first time all year that it was in double digits.", "We experienced reductions in expense per piece as the impact of our initiatives took hold.  Although the margin did decline 160 basis points yearoveryear, keep in mind that the fourth quarter of 2008 benefited significantly from the timing of fuel surcharges.  ", "Now let's turn to the International segment.  Average daily volume increased almost 12% with exports up 3%.  All regions of the world experienced growth with Asia and the U.S. leading the way.  This clearly exceeded our expectations as Asia volumes improved when customers upgraded from air freight to international small package due to the capacity constraints in the freight market and emergency restocking.", "NonU.S. domestic volume increased almost 18%.  You may recall in the third quarter, we experienced a substantial uptick in this volume due to our acquisition in Turkey.  Although that did contribute to the fourth quarter's growth, so did increases in other countries.  In fact, excluding Turkey, domestic volume would have increased 7%.  This is another advantage of our broad portfolio.  We're winning new business and increasing our share from current customers.  ", "During the quarter, the positive impact of currency on total revenue was essentially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel surcharges.  As a result, the revenue increase of almost 6% was due to strengthening business conditions and continued share gains.  International operations did an excellent job of controlling costs as evidenced by the improvement in operating margin to 16.7%.  This is 180 basis points higher than last year and demonstrates the operating leverage inherent in our international network.  Impact from currency was negligible.  ", "I would be remiss if I didn't mention peak season, which was strong in both the U.S. and International segments.  We experienced 8 days of worldwide volume over 22\u00a0million packages, two of which were over 24\u00a0million.  This was stronger than we had expected and necessitated exceptional execution of our peak season plan.", "Now for the Supply Chain & Freight segment.  Disappointing performance in the forwarding and LTL operations offset another good quarter in logistics.  Logistics revenue increased yearoveryear posting strong operating margins.  Business continued to successfully develop and deploy solutions that deepened customer relationships and drive transportation spend.  Particular strength was evident in the health care and hightech sectors.  ", "In forwarding, a surge in demand in a capacityconstrained Asian market led to rapidly escalating transportation costs.  This margin squeeze negatively impacted operating profits.  We are working diligently to negotiate customer rates that reflect market conditions.  ", "UPS Freight's fourth quarter performance was below expectations.  LTL shipments were flat and weight per shipment declined.  As a result, the unit reported a loss in the quarter.  We do have a very challenging pricing environment; however, revenue per hundredweight was up 2.8% as we maintained our pricing for value approach in this business.  UPS Freight also did see a gain in market share yearoveryear.  We will continue to optimize the Freight network and focus sharply on the middle market.  The unit should return to profitability in 2010.", "Turning now to a distinction that UPS has long enjoyed\u00a0 our financial strength.  Even in one of the worst years in decade for economic activity, UPS generated $4.1\u00a0billion in free cash flow through excellent management of working capital and constrained capital expenditures.  We also paid $1.8\u00a0billion in dividends, invested $1.6\u00a0billion in capital expenditures, repurchased a total of 10.9\u00a0million shares for $569\u00a0million, and ended the year with $2.1\u00a0billion in cash and shortterm investments.", "Two years ago, we introduced our funds flow from operations to total debt metric and said we were targeting a range of 50% to 60% by the end of 2009.  We ended the year at 58%.  Last week, S&P reaffirmed our AA credit rating, although they changed our outlook from stable to negative.  This was based largely on their calculation of funds flow from operations to total debt which includes pension liabilities as debt.  By their calculation, UPS is slightly below their target.  We have 18 to 24 months to close the gap, which I am very confident we can do.", "Now for our outlook.  Because we have more clarity into economic conditions going forward than we did a year ago, we're providing annual guidance for 2010.  Diluted earnings per share should be within a range of $2.70 to $3.05, which is an increase of 17% to 32% over 2009 earnings.  As Scott indicated, the recovery should be gradual; therefore, the first quarter will be the most challenging of the year with earnings per share only slightly improved from the first quarter of 2009.", "In the U.S. Domestic segment, average daily volume should increase in line with GDP with ground improving a little more than air.  Volume growth will be more evident as the year progresses.  Yields should increase as pricing strengthens and package characteristics improve.  In addition, we're reinstituting management compensation increases.  We anticipate operating margin for the first quarter will be a little below last year which should expand through 2010.", "In International, export volume growth is expected to outperform the market.  Domestic volume should increase at a midteens rate until the third quarter, when we lap the date of our Turkish acquisition.  For the year, domestic volume should increase in the high single digits.  Operating profit should grow at an annual midteens rate with margins strengthening over the course of the year.  ", "We expect the Supply Chain & Freight segment to achieve a mid to high single digit revenue growth rate for the year.  Operating margin should improve slightly in the first quarter compared to last year, expanding to about 5% for the full year.  As I mentioned on our last call, our overall tax rate for 2010 should be between 34% and 35%.  ", "Capital expenditures are projected to be $1.8\u00a0billion.  At less than 4% of revenue, this is significantly below our historical range of 5% to 8%.  In fact, CapEx for the next few years will remain well below our historical range.  Reduced capital expenditures reflect the fact that many of our current strategic investments are nearing completion.  ", "For example, our air fleet is the youngest in the industry.  Infrastructure is in place in Asia with the Shanghai hub opened last year and Shenzhen slated to open this quarter.  And the comprehensive expansion of Worldport will be completed this year.  We clearly will have the global network that we need to support growth.  ", "This year, we will accelerate funding of our new IBT pension plan due to recently released regulations.  The funding for 2010 will be approximately $200\u00a0million more than last year.  This will reduce contributions in 2011, and thereafter and we expect the IBT plan to be fully funded by 2013.", "Lastly, the streamlining of our domestic business will require a onetime charge and provide an ongoing benefit.  The amount of the charge will depend on the number of people who accept the company's voluntary retirement offer.  We anticipate it could be up to $80\u00a0million pretax and will be recorded in the first quarter.  ", "Let me remind you this restructuring will eliminate 1,800 positions.  We expect that the voluntary retirement program UPS offered to 1,100 management people will yield many opportunities for the displaced individuals.  In 2010, savings from this restructuring will be minimal since it will be offset by expenses like relocation that are not included in the onetime charge.  But in 2011 and beyond, we expect an annual benefit of about $0.10 per share.  ", "To conclude, you are seeing the fruits of the hard work that UPSers completed in 2009.  Going forward, we will build on today's accomplishments by capitalizing on the operating leverage of our global network, by maintaining disciplined pricing practices, and by leveraging the power of our broad portfolio.  Thanks for your attention, and now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.", "QuestionandAnswer Session", "Operator", " ", "We will now begin the questionandanswer session.  As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one followup.  (Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Helane Becker.", "Helane Becker  Jesup & Lamont Securities Corporation", "I am just kind of curious on the international side.  I know there was a lot of capacity that came out on that main, from passenger side as well as some main deck capacity coming out.  Can you just talk about what you're seeing now, kind of in January, ahead of Chinese New Year and what you expect through the first quarter on that side?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We are seeing demand continuing to be fairly firm so far in January.  It's not quite the squeeze that we saw in November and December when there was clearly a significant amount of freight left standing on the runways.  But it continues to be fairly firm so far through the month anyway.", "Helane Becker  Jesup & Lamont Securities Corporation", "Then you have that, just for my followup, you have that shutdown for about a week and then ramp up again.  Is that how we should think about it?  So January pretty good, February soso, and March kind of stronger than that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Actually the seasonal impact is fairly similar to last year.  We don't see this as being a period in which the timing of the New Year is going to make a big difference in yearoveryear comps.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jon Langenfeld  Robert W. Baird & Company.", "Jon Langenfeld  Robert W. Baird & Company", "You had mentioned in your prepared remarks that base pricing domestically is number one priority in domestic for 2010.  Can you elaborate on that?  What are some of the things you have in place to help support that priority, and what are some of the changes you've made?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Clearly as we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times in the last couple of quarters, now that the economy is stabilizing, we\u2019re focusing much more on yield management, on making sure that we negotiate and extract the value that we\u2019re creating.  It\u2019s been fairly comprehensive.  It involves first a solid rate increase.  It involves us making sure that we are pricing according to what the value is.  ", "We\u2019re frankly looking at some customers that perhaps were very aggressively negotiated during some of the tough times and revisiting those.  On top of that, we do think that a firming economy begins to lift all boats, characteristics get a little stronger, weight goes up.  So we clearly intend to be disciplined on this.  We will be aggressive on pricing where it makes sense and the volume is very profitable, and in other areas we will be a little more disciplined.", "Scott Davis", "It\u2019s also part of our restructuring was geared to taking our marketing locally.  I think that\u2019s a big change for the company.  In the past, all of our marketing was really centralized at corporate.  Each market is somewhat different.  I think the fact now that we\u2019re having the local presence we\u2019ll be able to educate our salespeople better on the value proposition we bring to our customers.", "Jon Langenfeld  Robert W. Baird & Company", "Then as a follow-up question, on the guidance.  Does the guidance or the 1Q commentary either, do they include the charge that you talked about?  Or is that separate?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We will likely report that charge at the end of Q1.  Our guidance does not reflect the one-time charge.  Although there will be some expenses from this restructuring that aren\u2019t in the one-time charge, training expenses and the beginning of relocation expenses.  That expense will be spread in Q1, Q2, and Q3.  There will be some charges, and that\u2019s why the overall P&L for the year is neutral, that are not considered one-time.  That\u2019s the moving of people that stay with the company and the training, etc.  But the one-time charge for the voluntary retirement will show up as a one-time item in our Q1 reporting.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I wondered if you could elaborate a little bit.  Kurt, you talked in the prepared remarks about the sequential up-tick in domestic margin.  You attributed it to cost performance.  Is there any way to put a little more color around that?  Are those initiatives full up, or should we expect to see more of those unfold as we move through 2010?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Clearly there will be some additional initiatives, the domestic restructuring being the most notable.  Plus we\u2019ll continue to have some refinement of our air network as the Worldport expansion is complete.  There will be even more volume that gets centralized through that network.  That allows us to reduce our air network.  ", "Although we did really see the culmination of a large number of initiatives that culminated in Q4, that was part of why you saw really the best operating results and the in effect our unit cost per piece for comp and benefits below the previous year.  A lot of the stuff we talked about did reach its final completion for Q4, but we have a few more tricks in the bag that we\u2019ll be using going forward.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Second, you\u2019ve talked about this concept.  You were just mentioning in a prior answer about demarketing some of the business that isn\u2019t meeting your threshold.  I wondered if that process has started yet.  And, again, if you could give us a sense of how that might play out through the year as well. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Clearly it has begun.  We talked about that back in October.  That\u2019s been ongoing.  During the depths of the recession, huge pressure on pricing and cost reduction; and in that environment we have certainly negotiated accordingly.  As we\u2019ve look forward a little bit, we have selected some customers that we think perhaps we should be charging a little higher.  We have gone back and begun negotiations with them.  Or at least as their contracts renew, we\u2019re taking a slightly different philosophy.  ", "It\u2019s nothing earthshaking.  Just making sure we\u2019re getting a fair return really across the portfolio from all customers.  ", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Sounds like most of that opportunity is ahead of you, right?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes.  It takes a year or so, at least, to cycle through contracts.  It will be just an ongoing process as we move forward.  That\u2019s why we do have more confidence in those results showing improving over time.  As a result, we expect quarter-to-quarter things to continue to get better.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "I wanted to see if you could give a few further comments on the thoughts on first quarter which relative to the thoughts on the full year and they appear, I guess they're not including that $80\u00a0million charge so they appear to be kind of conservative in first quarter versus what you are looking at for the full year.  ", "But it doesn't sound like demand had slowed down versus fourth quarter, so I am just wondering if there's something else on the cost side that hurts you more in first quarter or is something else we should be considering just in terms of the way the guidance is a little more conservative in first than what the full year looks like? ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Tom.  We have heard that question from a couple of people already even before the call.  We are migrating to an annual guidance.  Clearly last year we dropped back and went very specifically to quarterly guidance because we frankly couldn't see through the fog of war of the economic deterioration.  ", "As we look out over 2010, we see a story of a gradually firming economy, of pricing for UPS continuing to get stronger and stronger, of volume results getting better, continued improvement on cost management, and ultimately the restructuring beginning to kick in late in the year.  All of those lead to an upward slope over the year and lead us to produce, we think, a fairly ambitious goal for our earnings for the year of between 17% and 32% increase.  ", "Q1 is a good question.  There are a couple of things that are in Q4 that we're a little hesitant to extrapolate.  We did have a surprising uptick in December frankly as the domestic and the international peak season came in strong.  I mentioned we had 8 days over 22\u00a0million pieces and 2 days over 24\u00a0million pieces.  We're being a little cautious that momentum may slow a bit; although we do think that volumes at least will be firm in the U.S. in Q1, probably flat, maybe slightly up.  ", "We also saw the incredible squeeze in Asia with just unprecedented increase in demand which flowed into our package network substantially.  It cost the forwarder a little bit, but it definitely allowed us to produce tremendous results in international.  We're a little hesitant to extrapolate that.  Plus we are going to be having some of these relocation expenses and training expenses beginning to hit Q1.  ", "You lever all of that together, plus if you note that in Q4 we were still 9% below last year.  We are expecting earnings to be up in Q1 over last year, just not at the overall average rate for the year.  We took our best shot at it.  If economic conditions, the momentum, continue, then certainly there's upside potential.  At least at this point, that's kind of what we think is appropriate.", "Scott Davis", "I think it goes hand in hand with the fact that we do believe this is going to be a gradual recovery.  Even if you go back and look at the fourth quarter where you saw big economic numbers, you saw GDP quarteroverquarter up 5.7%.  Yearoveryear it was somewhat flat, up a tenth of a percent.  Industrial production was up 7% quarteroverquarter, but actually yearoveryear it was down over 4%.  ", "We think that's going to continue to get better as the year goes on.  In 2010, we actually see industrial production growing over 4%.  But it's going to take throughout the year to get to that level.  It's going to grow more at the end of the year than at the start of the year.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "My followup in terms of volume in January, if you could just give a sense of domestic package, international perhaps on the forwarding side, what the volumes have looked like in January and whether you've seen any falloff in demand or whether that momentum has been pretty good in January.", "Kurt Kuehn", "So far I think we've been modestly pleased with the momentum in January, domestic volumes have been holding at about flat.  Clearly they were higher than that during those peak days in December.  So that's stabilized a little bit.  Our international growth seems to be holding solid.  The rush in Asia, perhaps, is moderated a little bit on the freight side.  ", "But on the forwarder side the rates have begun to come down a little bit from their skyrocketing arena.  And also the UPS Freight is continuing maybe a little stronger in January than the previous month.  Modestly positive trends, I think, is the best way to look at it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Wolfe  Wolfe Research.", "Edward Wolfe  Wolfe Research", "With the CapEx coming down and the tremendous free cash even with the difficult earnings year this year, when do you go back to more aggressively buying the stock back?  I know, Kurt, you mentioned about S&P and building up your reserves a little bit; but when should we think about increased dividends and share repurchase and how do you think about those two going forward in a multiple year of lower CapEx kind of period?", "Kurt Kuehn", "That's a good question.  We clearly hunkered down last year and late '08.  We have been very pleased at our results on cash flow.  That didn't happen by accident.  We've done a good job in a lot of arenas.  We are going to be back soon, hopefully, to that problem of what to do with the excess cash generation.  As I mentioned, we do think this low CapEx will extend for several years.  The Worldport expansion and our international assets have positioned us well.  We are going to have a number of years of belowtrend CapEx and abovetrend free cash flow.  ", "We do review dividend primarily at our February board meeting, and we'll make some decisions on the dividend policy going forward.  Scott?", "Scott Davis", "As far as the share repurchase, I think we'll be looking at that hand in hand.  Clearly last year we decided to sustain our dividend, and we held off on share repurchases.  We did last year redistribute to shareowners about 100% of our net income.  So we did that through reduced share repurchase, but continued dividend.  Clearly we have no intentions of building a large hoard of cash.  Over time, we will be deciding when it makes sense to get more aggressive in the market.", "Edward Wolfe  Wolfe Research", "As a followup or a second question, Kurt earlier you said existing contracts, when you were talking about pricing, even some existing contracts that may be assigned during a more competitive period below market you would go back into.  How do you go back into them?  Can you explain the mechanism and how prevalent that ability is?", "Kurt Kuehn", "That's pretty limited.  I guess what typically happens for ones that may be outside the normal contract renewal, certainly we're doing during the very tough economic times a lot of customerinitiated renegotiations in which you may have a twoyear contract, but the customer comes back and says, hey, we've got to do something.  ", "As those opportunities occur, we are discussing those; and clearly in this environment we're making sure we look at which way the prices should go if the contracts open back up.  That's more of what it is than us aggressively reopening customers that are happy with where they're at.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter  Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter  Merrill Lynch", "You mentioned, Kurt, about a dime or so led to the $100\u00a0million of savings.  I want to clarify none of that is in your target yet, to clarify that.  If it's not, looking at labor or comp and benefits as a percent of revenue, you've gotten down to kind of about 53% now if you take out that other $100\u00a0million, maybe get into the 52% range.  A couple of years ago you were down almost at 50%.  ", "I am just wondering is that a trend you can see continuing to get those costs down?  Is there something on the labor side in addition to that you can keep getting cost down or is this about as tight, you think, on the labor side as we're going to see it?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think that has more to do with our mix of businesses.  That movement has more to do with whether domestic packages is a higher or lower total proportion of the total company.  If you look at forwarding, if you look at our logistics group, those all have dramatically different mixtures of direct labor to total revenue.  ", "We're very pleased with the momentum we've seen in our domestic and international labor results.  You can see probably the better measure to look at is the relationship of volume and comp and benefit expense which we more than offset, even with the headwind we've had of high inflation in the wages because of the reduction in our staffing.  As our growth comes back, we'll begin to hire new employees.  That has a very beneficial impact on our overall average wage rates and should further accelerate some of our efficiencies.", "Scott Davis", "That's a good point.  Clearly the effect of wage rates is the thing that we saw several years ago, even though we had a higher contractual increase, we were running probably a little under 2%.  This year we ran over 5% in part of the year and went down to 4% in the fourth quarter.  That's without growth.  As we start seeing this growth come back in 2010, clearly that will have an impact on that ratio.  ", "Kurt Kuehn", "In Q1, we do kind of cycle through most of those increases in our percentage of fulltime people that are at the seniority rate.  That's another benefit as that issue starts to flatten out.  That will help us as we move forward in the year.", "Ken Hoexter  Merrill Lynch", "Then on the LTL side, on the freight side, were you surprised that I guess with the struggles of some of the competitors out there that volumes weren't a little bit stronger or is that sounds like on your pricing side maybe that was an intentional move not to get some of that freight?  I am just wondering if you can talk a little bit about your move there.", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think we have been extremely consistent this year in the LTL arena.  We have not been aggressively pursuing volume at the expense of yields.  That's why, I think, we have led the industry in our revenue per hundredweight consistently with it possibly up, I think, 2.8% this quarter.  ", "We feel that the inherent advantages we have with the customer access, with the deep integration of technology into LTL processes, and with the quality and speed of the network, we would rather continue to steadily gain through our bringing LTL services to our existing customer bases, rather than being out there trying to aggressively gain share to perhaps drive a competitor out.  We're being patient, but we think that will lead for sustainable results and also the most profitable outcome longterm.", "Scott Davis", "You got to remember that industrial production, again, in the fourth quarter was down 4.6% yearoveryear.  That's still the best barometer for the LTL industry.  Until you really see manufacturing kick in, that's when you will see LTL kick in.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robin Byde  HSBC Securities.", "Robin Byde  HSBC Securities", "Just two questions.  On international package and the Shenzhen hub, are additional volumes from that facility opening in Q1 built into your fullyear guidance?  Then, secondly, just a sort of more general question on demand recovery.  Across your businesses, are you detecting a sustained restocking by purchasing managers or is it too early to come to that conclusion?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I will cover the Shenzhen hub and then Scott can talk a little bit about the restocking issue, which seems to be a hot topic.  Certainly we have embedded in our overall annual perspective some benefit from the Shenzhen hub, although frankly we're not overextrapolating that.  But it will give us a very efficient and also superior service for the intraAsian volume.  ", "So we do expect to see some real benefits from that.  It will also be a great way to serve the whole southern China area.  That will kick in beginning in February and we'll continue to lever that.  That, along with the global impact, which was a very large impact as Asia began exporting more in Q4, it helped to drive the recent results.", "Scott Davis", "I think the big change we saw in the quarter on inventories was not so much that inventories grew, but they stopped declining.  I think that's what we saw drive the U.S. GDP last quarter.  Not so much the growth in inventories, but the fact they stopped declining at the pace they had nine months of the year.  I think inventories are still pretty low and have room to grow as we move into 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Greene  Morgan Stanley.", " William Greene  Morgan Stanley", "Can we talk a little bit just on the B2C, the change in the domestic B2C volumes in the fourth quarter in 2009?  Where were they?", "Kurt Kuehn", "They were up slightly.  Certainly during the holiday season they were up more substantially.  We did see modest growth in the B2C.", "William Greene  Morgan Stanley", "Obviously all throughout 2009, they grew then.  If we sort of look at this going forward, that seems to be an area where there should be a bit more growth just given the changes that are going on in customer behavior.  How do you think about serving that?  Obviously that has challenges from a cost perspective to service a single delivery to a rural location or whatnot.  Is the Post Office a big part of the solution there, or do you think about managing that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "That's a good question.  I guess for starters, though, what we're actually seeing the biggest change in sequentially is the B2B growth.  We do think that at least for the next several quarters, this recovery will be more B2B driven.  So the B2C has been more steady over the last few quarters.  We have seen successive strengthening of the B2B.  ", "On the B2C side, when the consumer gets a little more confident we will see a bigger boost in that.  For some time we were seeing doubledigit growth.  Clearly that's moderated.  But the B2C certainly is a longterm trend that is positive.  That's why we're focused on providing a range of opportunities.  ", "We do have a portfolio from our traditional ground services, even premium services for residential, and to also our basic service, which is a bit of a hybrid solution in which the extended areas are given to the Post Office for last mile and we deliver in the more dense areas.  ", "Then at the very lightest end we also have our Mail Innovations business, which is growing very strongly that sorts primarily packages of one pound or less and also injects those into the Post Office.  We do see a collaboration on this environment.  We think that's the direction of the future.", "Scott Davis", "I think clearly even with people on the smart phones today you are seeing more and more people buy over the internet using those phones.  Obviously that's why we did the applications with BlackBerry and the iPhone.  I think you are going to see continued growth in that area.  As Kurt said, I think we're positioned very well to serve that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Art Hatfield  Morgan, Keegan & Company.", "Art Hatfield  Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Kurt on your comments about the 2010 guidance, you commented for the full year that Supply Chain & Freight would have margins of 5%.  Can you comment on whether or not that's a level you're happy with and potentially where that could go?", "Kurt Kuehn", "In the shortterm, we see that as acceptable.  We certainly would hope to be able to get higher than that over time with a good robust economy.  We're looking more for upper singledigit margins over the long term.  ", "And within that segment, clearly you will have different results for LTL versus forwarding.  Forwarding is very asset light.  Then our logistics business, which kind of sits in the middle.  5% is where we think we will get to this year.  We would certainly like to get a little higher than that long term. ", "Scott Davis", "I have made it pretty clear to our people around the supply chain side that we expect to be mid to uppersingle digits.  So we're not happy at 5%.", "Art Hatfield  Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Then as a followup, kind of jumping over to domestic.  In your commentary and in the release you talk about yields being impacted by weight per package declining.  Can you talk a little bit about that in more detail and maybe how that trended in the quarter?  And if you're seeing maybe a more permanent mix shift or is that still just an economic impact you're seeing?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We've done a lot of work on that.  There has been a longterm secular trend of modest weight declines over the years as goods have gotten smaller.  That's been hugely accelerated by the economic slow down.  As we've gone back and looked at past recessions, in the express business and in the commercial ground business, it's very typical that weights move with the economy.  ", "On the residential side, that's been more of a steady one that moves beyond cycles.  We are highly confident that weights will begin to improve this year in the commercial arena and in the express business.  That's highly beneficial to us because those packages drive modest increases in cost, but substantial increases in yield.  We're very confident that will happen.  You still may see long term some slight declines in weight as goods continue to get smaller.  But the big impact right now is the economy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Campbell  Thompson, Davis & Company.", "David Campbell  Thompson, Davis & Company", "I wanted to ask you why the cargo revenues were flat from the third quarter and down from last year despite these huge rate increases in the Asian Pacific region.", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think a lot of that was a good problem for us because a lot of people traded up to express package.  As a result, there was less capacity on the airplanes to fly the heavy freight.  Really it was a good issue for us.", "David Campbell  Thompson, Davis & Company", "Then following up on that, is it that easy to fix the squeeze?  It would seem to me we have demand, capacity hard to get that you should have been able to compensate for that with higher rates in the fourth quarter and not have to wait until the first quarter.", "Kurt Kuehn", "There's really three pieces to this.  There's what percent of the plane has small package on it.  And with the demand picking up, there was less available space for us to sell cargo.  There's just plain less available space.  We also directly sell cargo in our airplane for what's left.  Then the majority of what we move actually is done by our forwarding unit.  80% of what they hire is not UPS assets.  ", "That's really where the challenges on the rates were.  We were able to fill up our airplanes with very high yielding express and higher yielding cargo, there just wasn't as much room left for cargo because of demand.", "Scott Davis", "The spike in demand came on awful quick.  In fact our forwarders who have been in the business for decades have not really seen one come on quite that quick in the past.  I think it caught all the forwarders a little by surprise.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Barnes  RBC Capital Markets.", "John Barnes  RBC Capital Markets", "Can you quantify a little bit the expenses associated with your employment initiative?  You said those expenses were going to range from the first to the third quarter.  Can you quantify the size of that expense bucket?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We said that after that is done for 2011, we expect to see $0.10 a share aftertax benefit.  That gets you somewhere in $160\u00a0million to $170\u00a0million savings.  For 2010, that will basically be offset with the expenses that we'll be booking for those items.  Plus you don't have the whole year to get the benefit of those expenses.  That would be the annual burn rate.  Really the savings don't kick in until beginning in late April.  You get about a half of the year, maybe a little more than that, worth of savings and that's total offset by the expenses.", "John Barnes  RBC Capital Markets", "On the LTL side of the business, since you bought it, you have run into bad economy, struggling competitors, pricing environment that certainly has been pretty poor.  Have you given any thought\u00a0 has there been any change in your strategy as it relates to the freight division?  Are you looking at potentially scaling it back or scaling it up?  I mean do you think it's the right size now or do you need to get bigger?  How do you think about it just given what you've faced since you bought the division?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Our timing wasn't the best.  I will own up to that one.  Clearly we studied the LTL environment, and we did purchase Overnite in 2005.  We had a year or two of decent results as we began to restructure it.  We have invested a lot of money in it, frankly, because we're very confident that it adds tremendous synergies to our customer base.  ", "I think as we look at our confidence in can UPS bring value in this base, we are extremely confident.  The technology initiatives we've done, we think, are reinventing the industry in some ways.  The alignment of when do you use package, when do you use pallets, we think there's a lot of room for companies to save money.  ", "At a high level, we think we're bringing value to the marketplace; and we think we can also drive value to shareowners.  Unfortunately, it's been a very tough time for that.  So we've been disappointed with the financials.", "Scott Davis", "You know our history.  We're patient investors.  We went through the international package area in the '80s and '90s.  It took us a long time to get it there.  Obviously it's tremendously profitable today.  Supply chain, the forwarding logistics, we invested there in the early part of this decade.  It's starting to show the profits in that arena.  We expect the same in the LTL arena.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Justin Yagerman  Deutsche Bank North America.", "Justin Yagerman  Deutsche Bank North America", "You have been talking about it on the U.S. domestic package side.  Fuel was up sequentially, but yields were definitely off on a sequential basis.  I know it impacted the yearoveryear, but I was a little surprised in that sequential change.  ", "Can you talk a bit about the competitive dynamic in the ground market and maybe a bit about the impact from DHL on those yields on a yearoveryear basis?  Then I guess as part of that, the repricing opportunity in the beginning of the year.", "Kurt Kuehn", "You threw out a couple of pieces there.  I will try to knit them together.  Certainly DHL exiting the market had a big impact both on volume shifts and also on average yields.  DHL was significantly lighter on average than the UPS volume.  As we absorbed their volume into our ground and air networks, it did have a negative impact on our average yields yearoveryear.  ", "On top of that, the average weight of the packages across the network got lighter as there were less widgets per box with the economy being weak.  Fuel surcharges were a headwind in Q4.  For example, the air averaged about 21% fuel surcharge last year.  This year's quarter it was just a little over 7%.  Some pretty big headwinds still yearoveryear with fuel surcharges.  That will begin to moderate in Q1.  ", "All of those moving parts do have an impact as we cycle through.  Now Q1 will be the first quarter really without a significant impact of the DHL overlap.  There was some share shift in January for the air volumes, although the ground really had shifted totally by Q4.  That noise will moderate anyway.  As I said, we're highly confident with the firming economy we'll see strengthened weight and improved pricing power going forward.", "Justin Yagerman  Deutsche Bank North America", "From a competitive dynamic in the international on the same theme, do you find that you're picking up share that DHL has impaired from an international sales standpoint?  Or are you picking up market share in Asia because of their impairment coming into the U.S.?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We are seeing, we think, continued share gains across the globe.  In Europe which clearly is continuing to have economic struggles, we're continuing to see growth.  You are seeing it in our nonU.S. domestic business, and we're seeing it in Asia.  ", "We continue to feel very positive about the advantage UPS has of having a broad coverage in all three major economic environments.  That story is still being written.  It takes a long time to reach out to customers all across the globe.  Our salespeople are very busy.  We have had a significant focus on conversion opportunities, frankly, as UPS offers that unique coverage of Asia, Europe, and America.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Ross  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company.", "David Ross  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "First a question on UPS Freight.  I noticed that all the shipment levels stayed relatively flat, weight per shipment fell.  That's been going on for a little while at UPS Freight now.  I am not sure if it's just the economy or because you're penetrating the LTL market with your small package sales or if there's some characteristics of smaller shippers.  Do smaller shippers have lower average shipment weights than kind of large national accounts?", "Kurt Kuehn", "That's a very insightful question.  You are seeing a mix change at work here.  We are growing more effectively in the middle market where UPS' value proposition is extremely strong.  We are helping customers balance what goes in our ground hundredweight service, what goes on a pallet, and so the crossover point in some cases can be lower.  ", "Typically we do see a lower weight in the middle market than you would at the very large end.  Typically the shipment sizes aren't as large.  All of those have lowered our average weight per shipment.  We're continuing to show market leading results in our shipment growth, but the average weight per shipment is lower.", "David Ross  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Then on the technology front, you mentioned a little bit about the iPhone and BlackBerry shipping apps.  I was curious just as to what the impact you think that's going to make over the next year or so.  How does that really make it easier for shippers to ship?  How many people use it?  What is involved there? ", "Scott Davis ", "I think it's really another one of these major trends we're seeing where more and more people are going to use their smart phones to buy over the internet.  I think us having the ability to have these applications\u00a0 we think the best applications out there\u00a0 will obviously enhance the use of UPS going forward.  Clearly, I think it's going to drive more B2C shipments in the future.", "Kurt Kuehn ", "And the UPS app is one of the leading B2B applications on iPhone right now, for example.  We have seen good customer adoption.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Scott Flower  Macquarie Securities.", " Scott Flower  Macquarie Securities", "I wanted to follow up a little bit on Asia and get a little more color.  Are the patterns any different in terms where you're seeing volumes go in terms of the different trade lands?  And then related is there any concern that some of this rush or displacement because the air freight side was so capacity constrained into the small package division will abate as you go further into 2010?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think that is an issue.  That's part of our conservative guidance, I think, in Q1 perhaps.  We knew there was a big rush in Q4.  It did help to drive volume both into our forwarding and our package network.  We're a little uncertain just how that will wind down.  So far for January, we are seeing continued firmness.  ", "Coming out of Asia, we saw a real strong growth from Asia to Europe, actually\u00a0 over 20%.  That's been a real interesting story.  That had been one of our leading lanes.  It moderated during last year, but it was tremendous to see that coming back.  Actually the yearoveryear Asia to Europe was a much stronger trend than Asia to the U.S., although the Asia to the U.S. did firm.", "Scott Davis", "There was an awful lot of technology demand both out of the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter.  Not enough attention has been paid to that, but there was an awful lot of demand out of both Europe and the U.S.  The other area is intraAsia is an area that will continue to grow and outperform going forward.  I think our new Shenzhen hub will really highlight and help the performance there for UPS.", "Scott Flower  Macquarie Securities", "Then my followup is I know you all talked about the changes in the structure in the U.S.  I remember back, I think I am the last analyst from the IPO.  Scott you talked a lot about restructuring, structural costs in the U.S. in trying to get leaner.  Is this part of that longerterm roll out?  Are there other things that become part of the structural costs in the U.S. that you are looking at longer term?", "Scott Davis", "This company has transformed many times over the 102 years we've been in business.  This is just another transformation.  Clearly the technology is allowing us to do a lot of consolidation.  It wasn't that many years ago that we had 11 regions and 72 districts.  Now we're down to 3 regions and 20 districts\u00a0 so pretty dramatic changes.  ", "More important than the consolidation is the fact that we're going to do business differently in the U.S.  It's more about how we go to market and how we interact with the customers, more about decentralizing the U.S. operations.  This is a big transformation for UPS.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference back over to your host, Mr. Dolny, for any closing remarks from him or the panel.", "Andrew Dolny", "I am going to turn it over the Scott for closing remarks.", "Scott Davis", "It looks like this recession is finally over.  Believe it or not, that makes 21 that UPS has successfully managed through.  As we head into a brighter 2010, as our volume increases, you need to know that network efficiencies will improve, increased densities will reduce costs, and new employees will come on moderating our average wage rate increases.  This will all lead to margin improvement in the years ahead.  Thanks for joining us today. ", "Operator", "That does conclude your conference call for today.

At this time, I would to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. ", "All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we will take one question and one follow-up question from each participant. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In a moment, Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO will discuss first quarter results and expectations going forward.", "Before they begin, however, I\u2019ll briefly review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 Form 10-K report. ", "This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.", "I want to remind you about three adjustments we made to first quarter results. A $98 million pre-tax restructuring charge related to the reorganization of the U.S. Domestic Package segment. A $38 million pre-tax loss on a sale of the supply chain business and a $76 million, non-cash charge to income tax expense resulting from a change in the tax filing status of a German subsidiary. ", "These charges reduced net income by $175 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.18. In addition in last years first quarter there was a $181 million aircraft impairment charge which resulted from the retirement of our DC-8 fleet. The after tax impact of this charge was a $116 million or $0.12 per share. In their remarks today Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS results excluding the impact of these charges.", "Since we believe this is a more accurate picture of the company\u2019s performance. A reconciliation of these adjustments to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that companied our earnings news releases this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS Investors Relations website in the financial section.", "In addition during the call we refer to free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A Reconciliation is included in the news announcement this morning and his available on the UPS Investors Relations website. To begin our review of the quarter I will turn the program over to Scott for opening comments.", "Scott Davis", "", "Thanks Andy and good morning everyone. Last quarter I mentioned that UPS was well positioned to take advantage of improving global economic trends. That we have the ability to manage effectively, in response to changing market conditions. This quarter UPS started to prove it, economies around the world are showing signs of recovery. Experts are providing more upbeat forecasts then they were a few months ago.", "Conditions are slowly starting to improve and UPS\u2019 first quarter results illustrated our ability to take advantage of these trends.", "In the quarter, UPS achieved better than expected growth in volume, revenue and profit. In particular, the International Package segment really shined. You\u2019re seeing how our global product portfolio provides benefits to our customers and our share owners alike. Our strong management team quickly capitalized on this growth, while still controlling costs and we saw the operating leverage inherent in the UPS network.", "Also in the quarter, two significant infrastructure projects came to fruition, each strategically enhancing in our network. We opened the second phase of our Worldport expansion ahead of schedule and under budget. This enables UPS to continue to reduce operations in regional air hubs and fly a larger more fuel-efficient aircraft.", "In addition, we began operating our new intra-Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China. This hub allows UPS to better serve our customers by reducing time in transit for 100s of city pairs in the area. These projects required significant capital commitment and will enhance customer service, provide better access to international markets and improve efficiencies for UPS around the globe.", "In February, the administration announced the National Export Initiative, which UPS strongly endorses. It has always been our firm belief that increasing global trade is the best way to stimulate economic recovery and to create jobs. We intend to work with the President\u2019s team in any way we can on this new important endeavor. Since the beginning of the year, UPS has received wide ranging recognitions. The company was named most admired in our industry by Fortune\u2019s, one of the top ten most referable companies by Forbes, one of the hundred best corporate citizens and one of the top ten global companies in Climate Innovation. ", "UPS was also recognized for our work with women and minority owned companies. Now while words are gratifying what\u2019s important to us is the scope of what\u2019s being recognized. These accolades are testaments to the UPS culture that benefits all of our stakeholders. They are also a testament to our people and I want to take the moment to commend UPSers around the world for their focus during the quarter. Our U.S domestic restructuring is well under way and the new regional and district structure is operational.", "Everyone is doing a tremendous job, managing the business through these changes. Let me also recognize our European and Airline partners for the outstanding work they did over the last two weeks, in response to the challenges caused by the volcanic eruptions in Iceland. Our product portfolio and extensive European air and ground network enabled us to modify operating plans and limit customer inconvenience. This was a job well done. Now I\u2019ll turn the program over Kurt to review the operations. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well it\u2019s certainly enjoyable to have a quarter like this one to discuss with you. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit up 31% and earnings per share up 37% with margin expansion in every segment. The better than expected results stem from stronger operating performance in each segment than we had anticipated, yield improvement and operating leverage across the enterprise. ", "I\u2019m pleased with our ability to manage cost and increase productivity as volume began to increase. Compensation and benefit expense increased only 1.7%, while our consolidated volume was up 2.7%.", "Now, let\u2019s look at the segments, starting with the U.S. domestic package operations. Operating profit jumped 17% on a 2% revenue gain. This increase was driven by higher yields, stabilizing volume, network enhancement and good execution. As a result, operating margin was 9.3%, an increase of 120 basis points.", "Our average daily volume increased less than 1%. This was the first quarter, since the end of \u201907 with positive year-over-year growth. The increase in U.S. domestic volume was driven entirely by ground, outperforming the air products as expected. The 2% improvement in revenue per piece was the strongest, since the third quarter of 2008. It reflects retention of a greater portion of the general rate increase and higher fuel surcharges. ", "Base pricing was up in both air and ground and we expect this positive trend to continue through 2010, especially in our air products. Once again, our operations team demonstrated our ability to further optimize our networks by reducing direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours and this was accomplished while going through a significant restructuring within our U.S. operations.", "In the quarter, UPS continued using technology to improve efficiency and provide even better customer service with the introduction of UPS Smart Pickup. This industry first application ensures that UPS drivers stop for packages only when a customer actually needs that service. The process is easy, automated and transparent for customer and driver alike and will eliminate an estimated 8 million miles of driving annually. ", "Let's turn now to the international business, where operating profit soared 45% to $427 million on an 18% increase in revenue. Operating profit for this segment approached our historical first quarter peak.", "In the quarter, UPS experienced balance growth across all geographies and products. A combination of higher volumes from existing customers and new customer wins. Total average daily volume was up 18% with export volume increasing more than 9%. All major regions of the world experienced export volume improvements. Asia led the way up over 20% followed by the U.S. and Europe both of which showed strong year-over-year gains.", "During the quarter, we also experienced the lengthening of our trade lanes as inter regional trade picked up. As evidence by the 37% volume increase in our Asia to Europe lane. Yields improved 5% reflecting firm pricing, positive currency impact and increased fuel surcharges. The 24% gain in non-U.S. domestic volumes was helped by our acquisition in Turkey last August. ", "However, organic growth was 13% powered by strength in our core European markets. This strong improvement was against the backdrop of a weak euro zone economy.", "UPS\u2019s presence in domestic markets outside the U.S. also enables many opportunities to gain export volume. In fact the substantial percent of our non-U.S. domestic customers also use UPS for their export needs, taking advantage of our broad portfolio. ", "International operating margins increased 310 basis points, 16.2%. This resulted from leverage due to increased volumes and benefits from network and productivity improvements implemented last year. Good control of both operating and non-operating costs produced leverage in our results.", "Now for the Supply Chain & Freight segment. Revenue increased 14% and operating profit more than doubled, the Logistics business was the primary driver of the profit increase, logistics continued to experience strong growth and profitability gains in healthcare and high-tech. ", "During the quarter we ware proud that data monitor recognized UPS, as number one in Supply Chain outsourcing for 2009. This award validates the progress that we've made in building our unique Supply Chain management capabilities.", "Boarding experienced strong tonnage increases although demand moderated slightly from the fourth quarter, the industry capacity constraints did lessen slightly resulting in sequential improvements in operating margin. We implemented revenue management plans in the quarter which will improve margins going forward. ", "On the LTL front, UPS freight remains committed to its strategy at targeted growth in the middle market. As a result revenue per 100 weight increased 10% and LTL revenue was up almost 6%. Even with modest declines in both shipments and tonnage. This business unit showed solid improvement over last year although it still operated a slight loss. We expect it to be profitable for the year.", "Now, as I usually do I want to emphasize the very strong financial foundation that supports to UPS. In the quarter we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow even after $630 million in accelerated pension contributions over last year. UPS also invested $280 million in capital expenditures paid dividends of 470 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase and spent $260 million to repurchase over 4 million shares. Lastly we ended the quarter with 3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. ", "Because of the strong first quarter and improvement in the global economic outlook we raised our expectations for earnings per share this year to a range of $3.05 to $3.30. This is a 32% to 43% increase over last year\u2019s results. ", "The year-over-year change in earning should remain fairly consistent across each quarter, with the fourth quarter showing a lower increase due to a more challenging year-over-year comparison.", "Looking at the segments, for the full year U.S. domestic average daily volume should improve gradually with ground out performing air. We expect yields to strengthen as the year progresses, resulting in significant margin expansion for 2010.", "Keep in mind now as we continue with the U.S. restructuring we will incur additional costs for relocation and training. Most of which will occur during the second quarter, these items which are included in our guidance will negatively impact earrings by $0.03 to $0.05 in the quarter, constraining margin improvement somewhat.", "In our international segment we anticipate UPS export volume to continue outpacing market growth and non- U.S. domestic growth should remain strong but remember we will lap the date of our Turkish acquisition in August.", "We expect international operating profit to show strong growth and reflect typical seasonal patterns. Our supply chain and freight segment should generate gradual sequential improvement in operating margins.", "With the full year margin of at least 5% on about 10% revenue growth, to summarize we had an excellent quarter in which we successfully transitioned from a recessionary to a recovery environment. ", "Going forward we\u2019re determined to sustain the enhancements we\u2019ve made to our cost structure. We will continue to invest for the future while remaining focused on disciplined profitable growth and we\u2019re very confident that our diversified global portfolio will help us capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead. Thanks for your attention, and now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Gary Chase from Barclays Capital.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "", "Kurt, when you were talking about the yield outlook and Domestic Package you noted base gains on the air side and I think the comment you made was, you expect those to continue through the reminder of the year and you said especially in air wondered if you could just elaborate a little bit on what you think is driving that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Well, Gary clearly as you know the stabilizing our yields and rationalizing our pricing it\u2019s been a big priority of ours and it\u2019s an activity that\u2019s well underway and we feel pretty confident in the results, you are starting to see some of the benefits of that. ", "We have also seen in our Next Day Air business some strengthening on the weights and typically our Next Day Air package business is one of the most economically sensitive. So it also should add to the top line yields, but were continuing with, a disciplined process of looking at customers and making sure were pricing per value and at the same time growing the business. So we feel pretty comfortable that the environment on pricing will remain rational and clearly we\u2019re executing towards that.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Then on the expense side, if we take a look at the expenses you reported in the quarter and I\u2019m assuming that the $38 million loss on sales from SCS was in the other expense line. It looked very low for the quarter and just wondered if you could give us a sense of what drove that and if it\u2019s sustainable looking forward at, are we on a new run rate?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We implemented a number of initiatives those last 18 months or so in response to the economic conditions and so, we do feel pretty good that our other expenses are in good shape. Depreciation and amortization is up a little bit as we operated Worldport with some of the investments we\u2019ve got. ", "The big growth areas in general and our other costs are purchase transportation and fuel, which is one related to the lot of expense in our freight forwarding and the other just a commodity cost.", "The other expenses has a lot of line items, if you take out the one-time events, it\u2019s probably down about 8%, and that\u2019s things like expense accounts claims as our network runs very efficiently supplies. It may not maintain at that level, but we do certainly intend to sustain the reductions we\u2019ve made and control all those cost items, so that\u2019s the balancing act that we\u2019re managing right now.", "Scott Davis", "Yeah last year Gary that other, other expenses had that aircraft impairment in it too if you\u2019d recall that $118 million?", "Operator", "Thank you our next question comes from the line of Nathan Brochmann from William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company", "I wanted to talk a little bit, you\u2019d mentioned particularly in the air international business talking about benefits from both new customers as well as existing customers. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit of flavor in terms of the balance between the two and kind of what you\u2019re seeing particularly on the trends of the existing customer base?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We\u2019ve been thrilled with the substantial growth we have really seen early across the globe and we\u2019ve really had two big initiatives in our sales execution internationally. One is focused more on conversion sales, then perhaps in the past, we still remain a small player typically 10% to 15% share in most markets. ", "So there is tremendous upside for us to help customers migrate over to UPS and we have seen great momentum there. And then the other is to increase our share wallet the advantage of our broad integrated portfolio as customers can move up and down that portfolio and that\u2019s we have also seen that happening as things begin to turn. ", "So even with the economies still suspect especially in Europe we are seeing very good organic growth on existing customers as they began to use a greater portion of our portfolio. ", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company", "Great and also next question in terms of just talking about, you could talk about what fuel surcharges can of added into the total yield for the quarter and also how you think that might impact the ability to special line those price increases how that you mentioned earlier?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yeah fuel surcharges were a modest benefit to revenue really on the P&L side there was no benefit actually slight headwind because of the increase in the commodity cost. It will be more substantial in Q2, because actually at this time last year there were zero surcharges on the air side, so there will be much more substantial comps in Q2. But right now with the surcharges in the single digit it really isn\u2019t the significant impact on demand or customer push back. Clearly couple of years ago when things spiked then it became a much bigger deal in the overall actuation. But right now we think its things are pretty stable on that front. ", "Operator", "Next will go to the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Kurt can you talk a bit about the maybe the pent up use of express and now that you\u2019ve talked a bit about the transition. What levels could we see that express tampered down while you start to see that growth in the ground again?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Right now we are seeing some trade up, especially in our Next Day package environment, actually our Next Day letters is slightly negative things like refinancing and some of those activities are down. So, on the product side the express package we are seeing in pretty good growth and that we think as part of perhaps the beginning of some restocking and some increased urgency. So we feel that that will remain performing about the average of the product the package will. ", "The ground side is a little more coincidental we have seen that pickup sequentially, but it should move more in line with your overall economy.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "I'm sorry maybe I didn't see it clear enough, because it sounds like you're saying that it was up, but Next Day was down almost 4%. Right, so?", "Kurt Kuehn", "The package performed much better the majority of that declined really was the letter impact with things like refinancing and some of the financial industry down.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Understood. My follow up question would be on the LTL side. Your yields were up your volumes were down in a period where you would have anticipated the ability to take significant share. Can you, but you also know the profitability was or would be there. Can you talk a bit about the strategy and how much volumes you can see in that market or what do you turned away, talk a bit about your strategy there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Ken, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent, I think following a very disciplined strategy of targeting what we consider to be the sweet spot of UPS, which is the broad middle segment of customers with ease of use technology access and so what you\u2019re seeing is a mix shift in which the smaller customers are growing and some of the larger ones perhaps are not. ", "So yes, we are very proud of the revenue per 100 weight of 9.5% positive even with fuel surcharge, it\u2019s still substantially positive. So we feel very comfortable this is not a time to aggressively gain share and as you\u2019ve seen most of the players suffer from that. ", "So we\u2019re going remain focused on the knitting, we think we\u2019ve got a superior value proposition. We find the ability for customers to move seamlessly between our ground our 100 weight and our LTL services as a real value and allows them to save money. So we\u2019re being careful in this industry and there\u2019s risk if you get to aggressive.", "Scott Davis", "Yeah, certainly Ken the LTL industry has struggled and it\u2019s still struggling. We see sings of it starting to stabilize and starting to improve, but we\u2019re going to stay with rationale pricing and wait those markets start to stabilize.", "Operator", "Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Edward Wolfe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Thanks, good morning. Kurt, just back to the last question, if I look at domestic air volumes are down 2.2 and they were up 3.5 and 1.2 in prior two quarters year-over-year. I know you are saying on the letter side, but did something change because it feels like the market if anything is getting less worse, maybe you\u2019re getting more disciplined in calling some of that DHL business out or how do we think about that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, Ed I wouldn\u2019t put too finer point on one quarter data point, I mean we did successfully grow last year and gained share. We are being a little more disciplined. So on the increment, there may be some accounts that come or go as we look at that. But we feel very good about our positioning in the air market. We have lapped the DHL departure, so we do expect the overall air business to under perform the ground. So it\u2019s a combination I think of yield management and also just the overlapping of the tailwind from the DHL departure.", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Okay, and share repurchases you\u2019ve talked about having less CapEx and more free cash can you talk a little bit about the timing of when you might get more aggressive on buying back stock?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I mean our overall goal for this year is to buy enough shared to offset dilution. We did accelerate a little bit of purchases end of the first quarter and bought four little over 4 million shares which is above our burn rate but our goal still for this year anyway is basically to purchase at that level. ", "I think as we look towards the end of the year, clearly if the momentum continues the cash flow were generating and our earnings are increasing at a substantial rate and we clearly will revisit that policy. So it would be something we\u2019d look towards the end of the year and perhaps get guidance in 2011.", "Scott Davis", "Both share repurchase Ed and dividend policy and reinvesting the business will balance all those as we move forward, but the cash flow outlook does look extremely good.", "Operator", "Thank you we will now go to the line of Robin Byde from HSBC Securities.", "Robin Byde - HSBC Securities", "Just on this issue of purchase transport patient costs, these were up 24% year-on-year. How much of this cost is that 540 related and what are you seeing in April, are buying rates starting to soften again after the mini boost?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, the purchase transportation clearly the supply chain and freight is the majority of that 70% to 80%, probably and that\u2019s the combination of increased tonnage and the substantial increase in buy rates as you mentioned Robin. We have seen rates stabilize I guess so at least some of the big spike we saw at the end of the fourth quarter has moderated, but I mean it\u2019s still a very healthy market right now and we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that on our asset based side and we\u2019re managing through it on a forwarding side. So we aren\u2019t really seeing a decline in rates and clearly the disruptions in Europe, perhaps of greater blimp in the short-term anyway on that front also, but we do expect the rates to remain fairly strong this year.", "Scott Davis", "Yes, the other side of the equation, Robin. We are doing a better job just getting the rates on the sales side and forwarding. So the other side of the equation, we\u2019re seeing some strengthening also.", "Robin Byde - HSBC Securities", "So the balance is getting itself out?", "Scott Davis", "That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "Next moving to the line of Tom Wadewitz from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "I wanted to ask a question about, I guess the demand outlook. It seems that the transport data points have been pretty firm in first quarter and particularly an acceleration in March and a good outlook in April from a lot of the other transports. Wondering if you could talk about maybe the progression through the quarter and if you\u2019re seeing a similar trend that would lead you to more optimism about the Domestic Package volume growth in second quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well as always Tom, there were a few blips during the quarter that make the trends a little harder to separate out, February had some fairly severe weather, especially in the Northeast that depressed it, some of that rolled into March. In general we\u2019ve seen a gradual improvement over the course of the quarter and really that momentum has continued into April, but it isn\u2019t a I wouldn\u2019t call it a dramatic improvement. I think it\u2019s just a slow recovery and I\u2019m speaking primarily in the U.S. So we are seeing things firm, but at a fairly measured pace. ", "Scott Davis", "In general, Tom, in the U.S., we\u2019re still not in a robust economy. It\u2019s getting better, you\u2019re probably going to see 2.5% year-over-year GDP in the first quarter and probably similar on the IP side, but for the year were pretty optimistic, we think the industrial production should grow over 4%. So it should improve as the year goes on. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "Conversely we have seen very strong results on the global trade side, our shipments out of Asia were up over 20% this quarter and exports for both U.S. and Europe remain strong, so we are very pleased to see the global trade linkage. I mentioned the dramatic increase almost 40% in Asia to Europe, so it\u2019s good to see those lanes coming back strong, so we are going to adapt our network and be where the action is on those things and you\u2019ve seen I think pretty dramatic demonstration of our ability to capitalize on this improving growth both within our domestic operations outside the U.S. and in our export operations.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Okay, great and I guess the follow up on the yield side I know there are a number of moving parts in your yields which sometimes makes it a little trickier to kind of figure out what base price is doing. Can you give any sense on the air express yields in particular what was the greatest impact in terms of base price, fuel surcharge and mix?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yeah, we are seeing positive base price trends on the both the air and the ground side so that is a improvement certainly on both and most notably on the air side. The weight was up modestly on the next day express I talked to that and that\u2019s positive. So that contributed somewhat. And then fuel surcharge gave a bit of a boost probably between 1%, 1.5% something like that on the net fuel surcharge for the air. ", "We think all three of those trends, Tom, will continue stronger into the year. We think our revenue management efforts will continue to pay dividends we think weight will improve in the air and also we expect to see more weight on the ground and we have been very pleased with our progress on the revenue management side, so that\u2019s why we feel pretty bullish on domestic pricing across all the products. ", "Operator", "Thank you, we have a question now from the line of Scott Malat from Goldman Sachs please go ahead. ", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning thanks, just if we take a step back it just seems that many are surprised you are able to leverage improving volumes as well as you are? Can you just help us put into perspective this cycle may be versus some historical where may be incremental margins might not have been a strong as you are seeing here?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well I think it\u2019s a couple of factors. I think frankly one is that we took a bigger hit this year, the recession we are coming out of was by far more severe than any in recent history. So the degree of the penalty was substantial and we also feel that as a result of that there is more bounce back. Also I think we have worked extremely hard to find all the areas of refinement we can in the network. ", "We\u2019ve got new technology in place operationally, we\u2019ve got new assets in place, the Worldport has done substantial improvements on our network and a very strong focus across the company. So we feel pretty confident that with a little bit of tailwind from the economy and our operational changes we\u2019ll see great benefit.", "Scott Davis", "And you definitely saw in international, I mean clearly we showed tremendous leverage in the quarter nearing peak, first quarter of operating earnings in the first quarter so that\u2019s great improvement domestically in the U.S. As I said earlier we\u2019ve not seen that robust economy, we didn\u2019t see a lot of volume growth. So I got some benefit on average wage rates that they will get a lot more as we get into bigger growth, so if IP does grow at 4% which leads to better domestic volume you\u2019ll see lower effective wage rate increases which will obviously lead to better domestic margins down the road. ", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s helpful thanks, just the other one that I had was just on Asian regulatory, just been a number of signs that China policy is making it more difficult for foreign companies to work in China. Seems like the import, export business to be the one that the Chinese government would be less apt to over regulate, but can you talk about working in and around China, what are your expectations for regulatory environment?", "Scott Davis", "I think that it really has not changed much in the way in import and export. I think that we have had a good relationship working with the Chinese government in that area, as you\u2019re seeing by the volumes that have been generated in express industry, I think all the multinationals are doing pretty well.", "Kurt talked about our strong growth of 20% in the last quarter, it\u2019s a little more difficult when you compete domestically, I think that there is more protectionism, if you will, when you compete within the borders of China, and that\u2019s going to be a challenge. We talked about in the past we are going to go about that deliberately and patiently, but we will compete domestically down the road.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Jon Langenfeld from Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Benjamin Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Hi, this is Ben Hartford in for Jon. Wondering if we could just conceptually talk about the operating leverage this quarter, the way that you guys look at it. What was the primary driver that split evenly between pure volume growth pricing and the cost takeouts or did one have a greater impact this quarter than the other?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Certainly, this story is a little different in different business units. I think, for international it is, showing what strong volume growth does through a efficiently set up network and that\u2019s where we saw really the breakthrough results there. Domestically, there was not as much of a tailwind on the volume side, so we made up for it with productivity and network refinements. ", "Our overall direct labor hours were down 4%, and that\u2019s again slightly improved volumes. Our miles driven with our network alignments were down 3% and we had almost a 10% reduction in block hours in our domestic network. So a lot of changes, a lot of tightening and so we\u2019re seeing substantial margin improvement even without the tailwind of substantial volume growth, And as Scott mentioned if the U.S. economy continues to firm then that just gives us another tailwind and we are able to leverage some other economies like the wage rate improvement in the growing environment. ", "", "Benjamin Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "On the domestic side, I think you eluded to, you expect the shipping rates to improve through the balance of the year, was there a meaningful change during the quarter did we see a trend either way in shipment weights?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Really, the story for the quarter was stabilizing weights on the ground and firming rates in our express package environment. So we do expect that the ground will begin to show positive growth sequentially going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you, we have a question now from the line Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah, good morning. I just have a couple of questions on data points. Domestic growth in B2C, how much was that, how much was UPS basic up as well?", "Kurt Kuehn", "B2C modestly outperformed B2B. Bill, actually most notable as been the recovery of B2B and actually that\u2019s one of the drivers of improved margins within our domestic business for the quarter. ", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Sorry, but you said B2C was up more then B2B, nonetheless.", "", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yeah, historically it has been by a substantial amount; that gap narrowed this quarter. So the combination of basic and our traditional residential services were up above average for the ground but the GAAP has in some cases been double digit and it was much tighter this quarter, so we are continuing to see modest growth on our B2C. That business is very well positioned, but more exciting for us is the commercial volume showing more signs of life.", "", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "When you talk to your customers about where their inventory levels are, do you sense that they are far along in their efforts to restock or where do you think they are in that process? ", "Scott Davis", "Bill, this is Scott. I think there is quite a ways to go still. They are in the early stages of restocking and I think that just based on demand and based on some, we\u2019re seeing that people are urgent to get shipments there. We\u2019re seeing a little bit more demand on the express side. So I think we\u2019ve got ways to go; we are in the early stages of restocking.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Helane Becker from Jesup & Lamont Securities. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker - Jesup & Lamont Securities", "Thank you very much, operator. Thanks gentlemen for taking my question. I have two very unrelated questions, one I was wondering if you could just comment on the volcanic ash in the closings in Europe, I didn\u2019t see anything in what you put out this morning about that, so maybe you could comment on that. ", "And my other question is completely unrelated to that. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal had an article or an editorial about Brown Bailout, with your competitor Brown Bailout. I was wondering if you could just comment on that at all and kind of your thoughts with respect to your position on what\u2019s going on with FedEx being so aggressive in trying to get that provision changed? Thank you.", "Scott Davis", "", "Helane, this is Scott, I will start up with the volcanic ash and clearly the period from April 14 to April 20 was quite turbulent as we all know. We were able to continue to provide pick up and delivery service and re-routed open flights to other parts of Europe that we\u2019re opened during that period. ", "And we really are blessed with having an extensive European ground network that allowed us to really continue to provide transporter domestic service with really minimal delays to our customers. April 21, we actually opened up our Cologne hub and actually had unprecedented volumes, above last year\u2019s peak as you would expect trying to catch up for the period where you couldn\u2019t get into and out of Europe. ", "At this point in time, we really are now caught up and we\u2019re back on track. So I think we\u2019ve done a very good job, our customers are pleased with the service offerings being able to help through to this period, but it was quite turbulent, to say the least. The actual financial impact is too early to tell, we think it\u2019s somewhat immaterial to the company, but it's how much volume is lost, how much production was lost during that period of time, I think it\u2019s going to take us a few weeks to figure that out and so we\u2019ll talk about that in the next earnings call. ", "The second question, the RLA issue, I guess let me start out by saying UPS supports the passage of the FAA reauthorization bills quickly as they possibly can. This bill is important to the entire country. As you know it provides us funding for more than 150,000 jobs and also much needed safety in aviation system modernization initiatives. ", "So it's really important that we get this thing done for the country. Regarding the RLA amendment, I think this audience clearly knows the two companies, knows UPS, knows Federal Express, and knows that our companies provide similar services and provide services to similar customers and do a lot of the same things. It\u2019s actually illogical that the two companies should be governed under different labor laws. Our point here clearly is that the expressed divers do the same jobs for both companies, they should be governed under the same law. ", "What will happen, what\u2019ll be the outcome of this legislation, it\u2019s still not clear whether it is going to a conference committee or will be handled differently through Congress, but certainly we are optimistic we will get this thing done but most important is that we get this FAA reauthorization bill passed. ", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Justin Yagerman from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "I guess the first question is on domestic restructuring. You talked a little bit about the potential impacts of the second quarter, but I was wondering, as we look out over the year whether there are other significant costs that we should be thinking about, as we move through the remainder of, this or does it basically curtail at the end of the second quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, Justin, clearly the second quarter will be the big predominant expense. That\u2019s really the time at which the vast majority of our people that we have repositioned will be relocating substantial amounts of retraining expenses and other realignments and facilities changes.", "So that\u2019s why we really pulled out second quarter and said that it would be about a $0.03 to $0.05 headwind in the second quarter. Having said that though, we, following that, the cost will begin to taper down and will not be as material and would likely not be called out it all and the savings for the third and fourth quarter will significantly offset any remaining expenses.", "So it is a big deal for us in Q2. We were very pleased though with the fairly seamless process that happened in Q1, that was one of our areas of concern about our ability to operate through Q1 effectively and I know that there were some discussions about our guidance in Q1, so we have been thrilled with how smooth that went, how well our operations continued even with this major change going.", "So, Q2 will be the time that we get the majority of the knitting done and the expenses and then after that we will be in good shape going forward and we do expect for 2011 that it will give us at least $0.10 share tailwind for our domestic business.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "Alright and then looking at the LTL yield, obviously an impressive number given the environment, but just curious if you could comment around, weight per shipment was down 1.5%. So obviously that was somewhat helpful to the yield number and I am just curious you kind of alluded to the ability for customers to trade around between 100 weight product and your LTL product, so how much of domestic ground do you think is kind of making its way on the lighter end. ", "I\u2019m on the heavier end of domestic ground and on the lighter end of LTL into the LTL network and may be providing some of that benefit there.", "Kurt Kuehn", "I don\u2019t you know it moves both ways. Frankly, that\u2019s the whole point as it gives the customer the ability to choose, so as you look at the very light end of the LTL business those shipments tend to not be very profitable or effective and LTL and there are much better served in package and conversely as you get shipments 500 pounds or more. In the package it frequently is better to move those in the palate. So not a real big pull either direction, I mean the issue of the yield is primarily that we are targeting small to midsize customers that we\u2019ve been very disciplined frankly not chasing the market share grab that has created havoc in the industry and that we are creating some very substantial value, guaranteed shipments of superb visibility, integrated shipping systems. We really think we\u2019re building a very high value process and it\u2019s great to see the validation of it. ", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll go to line on Matt Brooklier from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ", "Matt Brooklier - Piper Jaffray", "Hi, thanks Good morning guys. My question pertains to on the international package division and the operating margins there, if we look at the continuing out margin and international package in the first quarter, it was actually down very modestly from Fourth quarter and it looks like and it feels like volumes actually strengthened throughout first quarter. I was wondering if there was anything, any incremental cost that you guys incurred during first quarter potentially may be adding some flights into the network as volume strengthened or anything incremental from a cost side that would have hindered you know you guys doing a better margin than international package during first quarter versus fourth quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "So the biggest issue is just the normal seasonal fluctuation, I mean Q1 is not usually your bang up quarter for transportation and international is the same. So I would factor that out and I think comparing quarters-to-quarters, actually Q1 was higher performance as I think Scott mentioned, we got very close to peak operating profits in Q1, compared that to our strongest period, so we feel very good about that. ", "We did indeed add in some block hours, I think as our International block hours are up something like 8% over last year at this time, so that\u2019s a good thing, that was our affiliate revenue and we\u2019re happy to do it.", "It\u2019s a combination of some routine routes added back in and also a significant number of extra segments. As we talked about the crunch on demand for air cargo, fortunately, we\u2019ve been able to take advantage of that.", "Scott Davis", "In fourth quarter has more dramatic business, the capacity squeeze out of Asia was real dramatic in November and December, which obviously helped the rates tremendously.", "Matt Brooklier - Piper Jaffray", "Just a follow-up question, what are your thoughts in terms of adding capacity with International Packages network, specifically on the export side going forward?", "Scott Davis", "We\u2019re happy to do it when demand justifies, that\u2019s part of this disciplined profitable growth strategy, we\u2019ve got the assets if needed, we\u2019re continuing to invest in the business and there is no better return for investors than a plane full of our international volume. On the other hand, we\u2019re not going to get too far ahead of the game. So, we\u2019ll continue our controlled approach growing as we see fit.", "Operator", "And we have a question now from the line of Chris Ceraso from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse", "Good morning. This is Alison Landry in for Chris. I just had a couple of questions related to the implied year-over-year profit improvement for this year. How much of the profit growth or the incremental operating margins is related to the cost saving efforts as opposed to strengthening volume in yields?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I mean both of those are piece of it, although if have to pick one, I think it has more to do with the operational changes we\u2019ve made during the declining time and now that the economy has at least stabilized, you\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits. ", "So domestically, it\u2019s clearly a story of operating leverage and the benefits of the big changes we\u2019ve made and frankly we\u2019re waiting for the tailwind of the economy to kick in. We\u2019re looking for modest growth over the course of the year. So that is not betting on the come.", "Internationally, it\u2019s a positive. It\u2019s a story of great operating efficiency and tremendous boost from both the economy and share gain across the globe. So we feel very positive, frankly in all of our segments. As you look across every segment of UPS right now, we\u2019ve got good potential for improvements. The domestic business is seeing the benefits of improved productivity and streamlining the international businesses, enjoying strong growth.", "Our forwarding business took a little bit of a hit in Q4 with the demand crunch, but we have stabilized that to done some revenue management and that\u2019s in good shape. Our Logistics group is showing great momentum and even the UPS freight, which is in a very tough environment is showing substantial improvements year-over-year and profitability and we do expected it to be profitable this year even with the extreme challenges across that industry. ", "So it\u2019s a combination of improving trends or at least lack of economic headwinds and a lot of hard work within the company. ", "Alison Landry", "Okay and then I guess, my follow-up would be just to that point with given the network, restructuring and cost productivities, where do you see long-term consolidated operating margins during say in 2011 or 2012? Where do you guys think you can get there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Yes, we are not ready to layout a hard forecast on that I mean it depends on certainly the shape of the recovery is there a new normal and economic activity were still holding back a little bit on that clearly our international is getting back closer to peak margins very quickly as we said at least our peak our earnings in the Q1 were close to our peak earnings. ", "Margins on international we\u2019ll see were growing our domestic business internationally much more rapid. So the goal isn\u2019t margins it\u2019s maximizing operating profit, but.", "Scott Davis", "Alison, so far to say better. ", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "But, were working hard to make sure we are taking full advantage of the environment that we\u2019re in.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Campbell from Thompson, Davis & Company. Please go ahead.", "David Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company", "", "I just wanted to ask you about $0.03 to $0.05 charge in the second quarter that you mentioned. The first quarter you have the signal doubt the charge for voluntary retirement, severance payments and so forth. But I take it the, in second quarter you will not consider that to be non-recurring charge you want separate that out?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Absolutely no that\u2019s just part of the operating earnings from here because that relates to repositioning active employees that\u2019s not part of our one time exclusion the charges we took in the first quarter related to are enhance retirement offers and the costs related to employee benefits to a fleet the company maybe a little earlier than they planned but going forward from here it will all be kept into our guidance and operations.", "David Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company", "", "Okay and the same question is then in the third and fourth quarter, some of these costs will continue but you feel that will be offset by savings from the repositioning?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "The lions share of the reloads will be completed in the second quarter. So there will still be some expenses but it gets to be minimal and really not material so we\u2019ll stop highlighting that as a head wind once we get through Q2 and talk more about the benefits and savings of it.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from the line of David Ross, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, please go ahead.", "David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Just have a question on the Worldport expansion you talked about increasing capacity 19% on the south side and you reduced I guess the slice in the network byproject and regional hubs loading up bigger air craft going into that a Worldport, can you talk about kind of where that leaves the network in terms of the capacity utilization whether there is I guess how much room is left to expand before you have to go back into those regional hubs and how for full those bigger planes are getting into that a little more.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yeah we think it\u2019s going to be a long time before we would need to use the regional hubs. We\u2019ve added substantial amount of capacity reduce in the number air craft in the air improves our availability it improves the efficiency, so borrowing multiple years of very strong growth we\u2019ve got a decent amount of time to enjoy this current capability in the network so this is not a short term benefit by any means and we\u2019re continuing to find ways to better lever it and take advantage of it, so its been really a flawless opening and operated well through teak on about half the added capacity and then in the quarter then we brought it fully up to speed and now its able to do for 400,000 pieces an hour which is just tremendous and we did, spend over $900 million for this expansion but those benefits paid back very quickly with reduced air craft purchases and with reduced operating expenses in air so that\u2019s been a great investment for us even in the midst of the worst procession in any of our carriers.", "David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Maybe as new larger aircraft are maybe more fuel efficient reducing number of black hours and so you are already getting savings from using fewer aircrafts and those aircrafts still have a good amount of room to go on capacity in terms of adding more packages?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Absolutely, and we do have some additional 767s coming online over the next three to four years that will naturally slide in and scale up against some of our existing 75s and A300s. So it\u2019s a very seamless and productive up scaling as growth comes in.", "Scott Davis", "Effective on fuel and certainly carbon efficient.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question-and-answer for today. Now, I will turn the program back over to Andy.", "Andrew Dolny", "Yeah, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Scott for some closing comments.", "Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Let me say that I\u2019m enthusiastic about UPS\u2019s future. We made the right decisions and took the right actions last year to capitalize in today\u2019s improving economic conditions. We\u2019re on the right path, there\u2019s certainly room for constructive dissatisfaction.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours, sir. Please go ahead.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, will discuss the second quarter results and our expectations going forward.", "Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.", "I want to remind you of an adjustment we made in the second quarter of 2009 for certain foreign currency obligations which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The after tax impact of this charge was $48 million or $0.05 per share. In the remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS' second quarter 2009 results excluding the impact of this charge. Additionally, all 2010 full year references and comparisons to 2009 will refer to adjusted results.  We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. ", "Reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS IR website in the Financials section. Finally, during the call, we refer to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation is also included in the news announcement this morning and is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. ", "To begin our review of the quarter, I'll turn the program over to Scott.", "D. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. We continue to see strong momentum in 2010 as evidenced by our results announced this morning. UPS earnings jumped 71% on revenue growth of 13% with improvement across all business units.  Now, this was achieved despite the fact that mixed economic signals continue to dominate the headlines. The U.S. is witnessing strong corporate earnings and moderate GDP growth, although employment and housing data remain weak. The debt crisis in Europe has kept everyone's interest, the stock markets around the globe reflecting this uncertainty. Yet, we are pleased that our European business showed solid growth again this quarter.  And Asia continued to experience significant economic expansion. Our export volumes in the region grew over 40%. UPS has exceeded this environment while also investing to further strengthen our global network. ", "In the quarter, we enhanced and built new relationships with partners in Asia. UPS expanded the reach for our services through strategic alliances in Vietnam and in Malaysia, providing greater access to customers in these important emerging markets.", "In May, UPS announced a significant new partnership in China with Alibaba, the world's largest small business e-commerce company. The agreement benefits UPS by giving us access to small and medium-size wholesalers through their new online marketplace. This platform provides easy use of our services for Chinese suppliers and eventually will be available to users around the globe. Our approach to international expansion, using alliances, service partners and acquisitions, has proved to be successful. The evidence can be seen in the strong international growth UPS has delivered over the years.  We are confident in this strategy. In fact, during the quarter, UPS was recognized as the market leader in Poland by industry trade magazines and the local press, accomplishing this in just five years following our acquisition of Stalicha. [ph] (18:22) Poland has become a key manufacturing center and distribution point for Europe. ", "I am equally confident in our U.S. domestic strategy. Our reorganization effort has started to pay dividends. UPSers has embraced the need for change and quickly adapted to the new organizational structure. Through the superb execution of our people, significant network efficiencies have been achieved, and our go-to market strategy is beginning to bear fruit. In the midst of the one of the most substantial changes in our history, the U.S. domestic segment reported 57% improvement in operating profit. We are not yet where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction. ", "Earlier this month, I was honored when President Obama asked me to serve on his Export Council. I look forward to working with administration and other business leaders to help achieve the objective of doubling U.S. experts in the next five years. To support the Export Council Initiative, UPS announced several key undertakings to help U.S. small businesses compete globally. Only 1% of U.S. small and medium-size businesses export products, and most to only one country.  Since 96% of consumers live outside the U.S., it's important that we help our customers expand their businesses and compete in the global marketplace. ", "Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to say that I am encouraged by our performance as we realize the benefits of our efforts. We made the right decisions, took the right actions and are confident of UPS' ability to substantially improve results during this moderate economic recovery.", "Kurt?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning. It's good to talk to you today, especially turning in great results like this. UPS global revenue was up 13%, with operating profits skyrocketing 57%. This is despite a mixed global economic environment. ", "The operating leverage we demonstrated in the first quarter has continued as witnessed by our margin expansion of 320 basis points. For the third quarter in a row, our compensation and benefit expense grew at a slower rate than volume.", "The numerous changes that UPS has made and the investments in our global network are paying off. Our progress on these has led us to increase our 2010 earnings guidance. ", "Now let's look at the segments, starting with U.S. Domestic Package.  Operating profit is up 57% on a 7% revenue gain. This increase was driven by yield improvements, increased volume, network efficiencies and superb execution. As a result, operating margin was 10.3%, an increase of 330 basis points. ", "Average daily volume increased more than 1% with ground up 2%. We are also beginning to see UPS customers trade up to premium services, and that is encouraging. While volume in our Next Day Air was flat overall, we saw solid growth in Next Day Package, although this was offset by a decline in our Letter products. This positive mix shift helped drive our 11% improvement in air yields.", "Total Domestic revenue per piece increased 6%, driven by stronger base rates and higher fuel surcharges. Our focus on yield management is clearly showing results. ", "The U.S. operations team executed this quarter to near perfection with improved productivity, service and cost management. With an increased volume, UPS direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours were all down. A job well done when you also consider the challenges presented by our U.S. restructuring.", "We experienced substantial relocation and training expenses for the restructuring during the quarter. The impact was partially offset by reductions in payroll. As a result, the net effect overall was approximately $0.02.", "Now for the International segment, where operating profit soared 78% to $521 million on a 23% jump in revenue. Volume increased 20%, with exports up 15% and non-U.S. domestic up 24%. We've seen international volume exceed 2 million pieces per day for three consecutive quarters, and for the first half of the year, UPS International profits were the best in our history.", "During the quarter, UPS experienced strong export growth in all regions, with Asia up more than 40%. Both U.S. and Europe export volumes were up more than 10%. Operating margin climbed to 18.8%, an increase of 580 basis points. The improved margin was driven by higher yields and effective management of our network by the operations team.  For example, during the quarter, our in-country cost per piece declined over 4%. ", "Over the past few months, there have been questions about how currency fluctuations will impact UPS results. Due to our hedging positions, currency did not have a material impact during the quarter. This will likely change as the year progresses, and I will talk about that later.", "Export yields are up 9% due to stable pricing, fuel surcharges and positive changes in product mix as customers traded up to higher service levels. For example, in our premium product, Worldwide Express, volume growth was more than 20%. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 24% driven by core countries in Europe and Canada. These results are also impacted by our August, 2009 acquisition in Turkey. Organic growth was equally impressive, up 13%.  The value of the domestic and export portfolio continues to resonate with customers. ", "Our results in Europe are impressive considering the disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud, and I want to recognize the great effort our team made during the quarter. Our customers told us that UPS saved the day by acting quickly to ensure dependable service. We leveraged our extensive pan-European ground network, and kept their goods moving. UPS technology enabled us to provide accurate and timely visibility throughout this challenging event.  Financially, the impact of the volcano was not material. ", "UPS recently announced significant upgrades to several of our international shipping systems. These enhancements improve ease-of-use, visibility and provide importers with greater control of their shipments.  We will continue to introduce innovative products and solutions that help our customers compete in the global marketplace. ", "Now for the Supply Chain and Trade segment. Revenue increased 21% on the strength of the Forwarding and Logistics business, with operating margins over 6%.  Keep in mind that last year's operating margin benefited by about 100 basis points from the sale of the International MBE business. Forwarding experienced improved results this quarter, with strong tonnage growth led by high-tech. Industry capacity continues to be constrained putting some pressure on our margins. We remain focused on revenue management, and expect to see margin expansion as the year progresses.", "As expected, UPS Freight has returned to profitability this quarter, a result of our targeted growth strategy. Freight revenue per hundred weight increased 9%. This will again be one of the industry's best results. Though we had modest declines in shipments and tonnage, weight per shipment improved. ", "Our Logistics business unit continues to experience strong results from the healthcare and high-tech industries. Solutions created within this unit enable us to add value for our customers, benefiting through the alignment of multiple UPS capabilities. This is unmatched in the industry.", "Once again, the unique UPS operating model produced significant cash. Year-to-date, we have generated more than $2.5 billion in free cash flow. In addition, we have invested $690 million in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $910 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase, spent $425 million to repurchase approximately $7 million shares, and UPS ended the period with over $4 billion in cash and marketable securities. ", "UPS' cash position remains strong. We will continue to follow our current stock repurchase strategy of offsetting the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation. We will consider changing this strategy once the S&P outlet for UPS is modified. I am confident of meeting their targets by the end of this year. ", "This quarter, we did mark down certain auction-rate securities to their market value. The write-down was $21 million offset to our investment income.", "Now for some comments on our outlook. Looking forward, even when we consider expectations for a slow economic recovery in the U.S. and the uncertain outlook in Europe, we are more confident than we were earlier in the year in UPS' ability to grow and generate substantial profits. This leads us to raise our full year 2010 guidance to an expected range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. This represents a 45% to 50% increase over last year's results.", "Looking at the segments. In the Domestic segment, volume should grow in line with GDP for the remainder of the year. The third quarter will show better results due to easier comps and the way the Fourth of July holiday fell last year. We expect to continue seeing significant year-over-year margin expansion. ", "In our International segment, for the second half of the year, we do expect to see export growth rates moderate but still outpace the market. The rate of volume growth will somewhat depend on whether the Asia export market continues to grow at its current lofty pace. Also, year-over-year comps will become more challenging, particularly in the fourth quarter.  We do expect a headwind from currency in the second half of the year of approximately $25 million per quarter. Based on these assumptions, we expect International profits for the remainder of the year to reflect typical seasonal trends with the third quarter lower than the fourth. ", "The Supply Chain and Freight segments should produce full-year margins of approximately 6% on revenue growth in the low teens.", "All in all, UPS had a tremendous quarter, led by significant margin expansion on strong revenue growth in our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. We are very encouraged by the accelerated growth we're seeing in revenue and profit across all business units. Our ability to generate cash, coupled with an outlook for moderate capital requirements, will ensure that UPS continues to generate significant shareowner value going forward. ", "Thanks for your attention. And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question in queue will come from the line of Mr. Jon Langenfeld of Robert W. Baird.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Can you talk a little bit about your weight per shipment both in the ground side as well as on the Domestic Express side?", "D. Davis", "Yes, great. The weight per shipment was a positive trend across most of the businesses. It was definitely notable in our International Express services as heavier goods moved. In the Domestic, it's a little bit of a mixed picture. We saw very notably in our Next Day Air Package segment as growth begin to kick in and also weights went up. The Ground business was up moderately but not materially, but clearly, the rising weights is a positive leading indicator and we were pleased to see that.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "It sounds like there\u2019s still room to grow on the domestic side.", "Kurt Kuehn", "John, I think that we're still pretty optimistic on industrial production continuing to grow. It clearly outpaced GDP this year. That's just the best barometer for us. If manufacturing kicks in, we should see heavier products both in the Ground and Air.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "I was curious to get a little bit more color on, Kurt, you were talking about in-country cost internationally going down 4%. Wondered if you could just give a little bit more color on what you're doing there to drive that and sort of how far along in that process we are.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Gary, the catalyst for this was the downturn we had as the economy to began to hit the skids. And we did shift gears pretty dramatically from what had been a decade of unimpeded growth to tightening up and just our challenging our network. So the recession was a challenge in our International business, but it also gave us an opportunity, really, to go in and streamline and make more efficient some of our processes. So what you're seeing now is a more highly tuned network, with volume back up dramatically. So we\u2019re getting economies of scale, and we\u2019ve got the core efficiencies that we can hang on to.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "And then just a quick one, the $25  million in headwind that you referred to, is that net of edges, and can you tell us how much the hedges are offsetting if it is?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, that's certainly net of hedges. We use a collar strategy where we protect most of the downside and give up in some cases some of the upside. So certainly the euro has been very volatile; that is by far our largest exposure. And the $25 million estimate basically assumes the euro stays in the upper 120s where it is today. We do have protection if it gets much worse, so we don't think the currency could get much worse than that. But certainly, that is something that we\u2019re very active with and we constantly hedge to reduce some of the volatility. And it did that for the second quarter; third and fourth we\u2019ll see some headwinds, but still much less volatile than it would be otherwise.", "Operator", "Our next question\u2019ll come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On the yields, I was wondering if you could give a little sense of how much of the yield in Air and Ground is base price increase and how much is fuel surcharge in mix? And I guess then, in terms of the price, whether that accelerates going forward? So I guess a question on yield and price?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, it\u2019s a little different story for each of the products. In the Ground, certainly, the majority of the yield increase is base pricing as we've not seen much of a tailwind from weight. So that's probably the best indication as far as the status. There is some tailwind. On the Air side, somewhere around half would be fuel, and there is a little bit of a mix benefit. We\u2019ve talked about that Package is growing substantially, more than Letters, which are declining. Clearly, with the very low numbers of new home sales and year-over-year negatives on refinancing, the Letter business is being challenged. But the weight did help on the Air also.  But now, we feel very good about our yield management campaign, Tom. As we've said, we've made that a priority. And so it's a gradual process, but we're pleased to see the benefits of that.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then a follow-up, you were pretty helpful with the comments in currency impact in second half, $25 million a quarter. If the euro and exchange rates where they are today, what would the impact be in 2011? Presumably there\u2019s somewhat of a headwind. Is that another $50 million headwind or more or less than that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we are pretty well-hedged for next year, although clearly over multiple years we can\u2019t be indifferent to it. So there is some risk to that. We're not ready yet to give any specific numbers, Tom, but the goal that we have is to not been indifferent to it. We think it\u2019s too expensive to try to hedge away all volatility, but also to make sure that it never becomes the primary story.", "D. Davis", "Tom, our practice for the last decade has been to try to hedge a year in advance, and we\u2019ve stuck with that practice.", "Operator", "Our next question\u2019ll come from the line of Mr. Edward Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "I hate to pick apart of a nice-looking quarter, but if there's one thing that I look at here, the Domestic volume, up 1.2%, how do you think about that and particularly the Air, obviously, which domestically is weak? And what's in your guidance going forward in the second half for your volume expectations domestically?", "D. Davis", "Ed, we did guide this year that we thought that the Air business would underperform the Ground business. Clearly, last year we had the benefit of the overlap with DHL's retreat from the domestic market. Our guidance is not assuming any dramatic economic uptick. That was one of the things we wanted to make clear. But we do think that we will see our volumes somewhere around GDP growth rates for the remainder of the year. We get a little bit of a tailwind, frankly, in Q3 with the way the calendar hits. Fourth of July last year added an operating day to us without much extra volume. So there's a little bit of a tailwind there. So we do see third quarter volumes improving over the second quarter, and then the fourth quarter will depend a lot, certainly, on how the holidays turn out. But all in all, we're pretty confident that our volumes should be growing at GDP rates.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And on the other side, Ed, I think the numbers are little misleading because frankly, our Next Day Package business was pretty good in the quarter, where our Next Day Letters were down fairly significantly so that the Package business on the Air side was better than the overall results showed.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Can you give some numbers around that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Oh, Next Day Package was up around 2%. So it actually did show some growth.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue will come from the line of Mr. Scott Malat of Goldman Sachs.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Following up on Ed\u2019s question a little bit, I just wanted to better understand what you see kind of as the elasticity of demand. Maybe if you can help us think about, I think the volumes are fine where they are, but as you take up price, how are those accounts volumes versus accounts that you haven\u2019t addressed yet, or are there any buying pattern changes in those accounts that you\u2019ve addressed price?", "D. Davis", "No, so far, we've got pretty good success, we think that we are, as we said, our top priority for this year is stabilizing the pricing environment. So on the increment, there may be some accounts that plus or minus. But in general, we've been pleased with our ability to sustain rate increases without significant impact from our customers. So we do think the market will continue to grow gradually. We've been forecasting this being a gradual economic recovery, and I think, clearly, it's playing out that way. But we feel pretty good about our ability to sustain modest but substantial rate increases and at the same time, continue to grow with the economy.", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think generally the small package market didn't drop as much as the overall economy did during the recession. Into the recovery, I think you'll start seeing the small package market catch up to GDP and IT levels as we move through this recovery. So you'll see it get better.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then following up just on the volumes, maybe on inventory restocking last quarter, you said you were in the early stages. Should this be a tailwind as we continue to go forward or are most of the benefits behind us? Where are we on that?", "D. Davis", "I think we're just partway through this game.  I think the inventory-to-sales ratio has gone up some but is still well below the prerecession levels. So I would think you\u2019re going to still see more restocking. I think we saw not quite as much in the second quarter as we saw in the first. But I expect to see that in the second half of the year continue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Scott, just following up on that, where is the confidence of the shippers? Are they moving to really start increasing that? I'm just wondering as we look forward to peak shipping season, what are your discussions like as shippers start to prepare for that?", "D. Davis", "It's early to talk I think on peak season in the U.S. I think you started to see some talk on the ocean side in heavy freight.  You start to see that pick up. I think it's pretty good confidence out there that certainly the technology companies have had a banner 12 months, and I don't see that letting up in the near term. So I think it feels pretty good if B2C stays strong. We saw more improvement in B2B over the last quarter or two. So despite Chairman Bernanke saying all the usual uncertainty out there, I think overall, our shippers are still pretty good.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I guess when I look at the growth  at the Ground, the 1.8% volume growth, is there a difference between what we\u2019re seeing on that Parcel Direct there, that kind of direct-to-home versus what you\u2019re seeing on standard packages?", "D. Davis", "Historically, the B2C, the direct-to-home has significantly outgrown the B2B. We've actually seen those two growth rates equalize more and more. This has been more of a B2B recovery. And that's evidence of what Scott talking about with industrial production and some of those things. So this is probably as close as the two have been in a number of years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robin Byde of HSBC.", "Robin Byde - HSBC Global Research", "Just a follow up on yields. On international domestic", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robin Byde of HSBC.", "Robin Byde - HSBC Global Research", "Just a follow-up on yields. On international and domestic yields, if we\u2019ve got our numbers correct, I think you fell by about 5% in the quarter year-on-year. If that is correct, could you just explain the reasons for that, please?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Robin. We\u2019ve got one big event in there that makes it a little hard to really peel back what\u2019s going on in that, and that was our acquisition in Turkey that has dramatically increased our growth rates. The average yield in that country is far below the more developed markets of Europe and Canada. If you took out Turkey, we would actually show a slight positive for yield on our domestics. So we're very comfortable with the pricing in our domestics. We've actually been thrilled to see the substantial demand, even with Europe being the lion\u2019s share of that, for our services. So that will wrap around next quarter. Third quarter, you will have half of Turkey comp in there and the other half. And then I think once we get past that, you'll see a more stable, maybe slightly increasing yield in our domestics. So it\u2019s certainly not through price that we've been gaining this outside share.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Just a quick question. Can you give us the percentage of the business in the domestic market that's B2C?", "D. Davis", "Domestic U.S.? It runs about a third.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "So it hasn\u2019t really grown? Because I thought it had been growing faster. In the past, we sort of said it got a percent or so a year in share, if you will.", "D. Davis", "I think that\u2019s about right. I think it\u2019s been over the last probably 20 years it's been going about a percent a year. So I don't think it\u2019s changed dramatically.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "And how is that compared to Europe?", "D. Davis", "Bill, as I said, right now we\u2019re actually seeing B2C and B2B growth fairly similarly, given the current economy. Europe would be a lower percentage. I don't have exact numbers, but it's certainly much lower. Our focus there has been more business-to-business, more focused on export, which tends to be more business-oriented. Although, clearly there's a lot of companies in Europe and a lot of global companies that are looking more and more B2C and that is a rapidly growing area.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Just a question on cash. I realize that you run a conservative balance sheet, but you're sitting on a lot of cash. And even some of the railroads are buying back more stock than you are, and I don't think we could say that they are more cash-positive than UPS. So I just don't understand that sort of conservatism that you're having relating to sort of stock buybacks and return of capital.", "D. Davis", "Bill, thanks for that question. And I tried to be explicit on it in my prepared remarks. But right now, our intention is to get our S&P outlook improved. They had concerns, given last year's results, of our funds flow from operation to debt margin. They gave us a benchmark. We're very confident we will meet that the benchmark this year way ahead of schedule. And until that point, our strategy is to repurchase enough stock to avoid dilution through our stock compensation. After that, we will revisit that, and certainly we have a commitment to return capital to share owners. And of course given where taxes are may make a difference also.", "D. Davis", "Absolutely. Certainly our distribution policy has been strong. We\u2019ve distributed most of our earnings the last several years. We\u2019ll watch very closely what happens in Congress through the end of 2010 and figure out what happens on tax policy. And that certainly could impact the dividends versus share repurchase.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Matt Brooklier of Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Two questions; one international, the other domestic. You guys had some cautious commentary in your press release regarding kind of your outlook in Europe. I was just wondering if you could provide some more color there. Is it just you positioning yourselves for the potential for slowdown, or are you currently seeing a slowdown within that part of the world?", "D. Davis", "I actually think that Europe has been somewhat of a pleasant surprise based on all the media highlighted this year in sort of the [ph] sovereign debt crisis. In fact, I just came back from a conference with about 100 CEOs and we talked about Europe. And all of us are guarded about Europe just because all the unknown, but I think all of us are seeing pretty good business in Europe. In reality, I think the outlook for the Euro zone GDP has probably dropped from like a 1.5% growth rate to a 1% growth rate through all of this hoopla on the sovereign debt issue. So I don't think it's changed that dramatically, and certainly our business has been very strong. We talked about the digit growth in our European export products and you saw the growth in European domestic products. So it actually feels pretty good over there. We're going to be watchful and see what happens, but right now it feels pretty good in Europe.", "Matthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies", "And on the Domestic Package side, I think Kurt mentioned some cost benefits and some cost minuses during the second quarter. I think I heard a $0.02 number. Can you just talk a little bit about what the net impact was there from a cost perspective and how do we think about operating margins with that Domestic Package going forward?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we did execute the lion's share of the restructuring and we did see a significant amount of expenses in the second quarter; things like relocations of training. Although, we also were able to get some of the labor savings a little quicker than our plan. So the net impact for Q2 was about a $0.02 headwind overall of cost. That will improve in the third quarter, where the amount of reloads [ph] begin to taper down. So it will be a very modest positive in the third quarter, and then in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll see more of the benefit. But we do continue to estimate about a $0.10 a share benefit from the Domestic restructuring. That will be manifest for 2011. Clearly, it's one of the things we have going into next year that will be a positive. So the overall restructuring was the net positive $0.02 a share; a little better than, frankly, we\u2019d thought. But on top of that is just the ongoing benefit from the wide array of cost initiatives and network enhancements we\u2019ve made. And that's why we're seeing three quarters in a row now where an aggregate, our comp in benefits, are increasing at a slower rate than our package volume.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "You've talking a lot about your International growth. And as you talk to your customers, do you think we're seeing a modal shift from ocean to air and how they think about managing their supply chain?", "D. Davis", "Yes, there\u2019s a little bit of that going on right now. I think right now, there is somewhat of an ocean squeeze. Containers are hard to get. And that, combined with the fact that there were a number of shippers last year that really got stretched late into the holiday season, that's why there was such an explosion in the forwarding activities. So we are seeing, I think, shippers plan ahead a little more, perhaps plan to use a little more air, clearly. The Air Forwarding and our Air Express businesses are growing very rapidly. So in general, my guess is there will be a little heavier concentration of air this year for the holidays.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "You talked about your customers trading up, and maybe it's along the same lines. Do you think this is a function of your customers really managing lean inventories and trying to manage their inventory situation?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I think we're getting back more to a normal environment. It's great to run very tight. It's great to use slower and lower cost modes, and during the midst of this recession, that was the priority. Customers had to reduce their balance sheet. They had to reduce their cost. Now that things are a little more stable, shippers are looking back at, \u201cHow do I optimize? How do I make sure I\u2019ve got availability for goods without over-investing in inventory?\u201d And so that's where the more rapid services come in. So we're pleased to see that.", "D. Davis", "And clearly [ph] we talked earlier about inventory-to-sales ratios, and frankly, they were pretty low going into the recession. They\u2019re a lot lower now than they were when we went into the recession. So I think that will drive some of the trade-up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose.", "Helane Becker - Citi", "So I appreciate all of the responses that you've given and I kind of think most of my questions have been answered. Just one clarification: Do you think that you're seeing somewhat of an uneven recovery with industrial businesses growing and consumer-related businesses maybe growing not as fast? Or consumers slowing down, but corporations growing faster?", "D. Davis", "I think the feeling is there\u2019s pretty good consensus that this will be a business-led recovery. I think that a pleasant surprise was probably in the first quarter on retail sales and the strength of the consumer. And in fact, the consumer\u2019s probably doing a little better than any of us thought a year ago at this time. But I think this is a business-led recovery. And you'll see industrial production continue to grow faster than GDP overall, and that\u2019s driven up through the manufacturing side.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Morgan Keegan.", "Arthur Hatfield - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "I want to get your commentary on if you're seeing anything unusual in any of the markets from any competitors that you have? Anybody who's introduced new services, if they're being aggressive about how they're trying to maybe take some market share?", "D. Davis", "No, Art. I think the market has been very rational. I think internationally, we've seen stable pricing. I think all players had some challenges and they've been very rational. Domestically, the market is sluggish, I guess. The demand is not robust, but the pricing is rational. Clearly, the Post Office is wrestling with its financial issues. On the service side, FedEx has been expanding their global network. They're making a big deal of the 777 as its game-changer. I mean, that makes great press, but frankly, we're very comfortable with our 747-400 assets. So we can pretty much to go toe-to-toe. The 747 costs 40% to 50% less than a 777 from a capital perspective. And frankly, anything less than 4,500 miles, it has a substantial payload advantage and it pretty much matches the 777 for, say, Asia to Europe. But it's good. I mean, we want to compete on service and speed and quality. And so that's what makes the market a healthy one. So we see competition continuing normally. We're continuing to reinvest with technology, capacity and merging all of our capabilities. And that's one of the big stories where I think we\u2019re really succeeding these days. It\u2019s all about the pieces of the UPS puzzle coming together. So all in all, we think the competitive environment is very positive. All providers are competing like crazy, but also being rational. And we don't expect robust economic recovery, and that's what we try to make clear, both in our prepared comments and our press release. But we think even in this modest environment, we can prosper and continue to raise profits substantially.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Probably the one area in the world that we're still paying attention to is China. And there's a lot of things going on in China. For example, the Chinese government is talking about consolidating the three airlines' cargo operations over there. And while that wouldn\u2019t have much impact on the Small Package side of things, it could impact our Freight Forwarding business where we use those airlines. So those are things that are kind of in the process of change, so we'll pay attention to.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "I wanted to ask about operating leverage. Obviously, a very strong quarter for operating leverage. You guys are showing more than you have in the past. Now, I would imagine things like trading up in products and some of the re-pricing of DHL business is helping that out. Can you talk a little bit to where we are in terms of those events in particular, and then also kind of where you think we are in terms of you guys being able to display this kind of operating leverage on a consistent basis in terms of costs coming back in the cycle?", "D. Davis", "Clearly, the environment stabilizing is a great help. I think we did numerous initiatives and we talked about us being able to keep the majority of those cost savings. We meant it, and I think you're seeing it. So we've been very pleased with the direct productivity with the network changes. Having the highly automated hub with tremendous capacity and Worldport continues to allow us to take aircraft out of the sky and replace smaller aircraft with larger aircraft. So we're seeing the network economies there. I talked a little bit about our assets around the globe. The 747-400 is a very capital-efficient asset that meets customer needs. I think one of the areas where we've not seen the operating leverage as much is in the wage arena. Clearly, with us continuing to improve productivity, we've not had a need to add many employees. So we\u2019ve still not yet seen the latent benefits of the labor contract, whereas we began to grow and add employees. We will see lower average wage rates ripple through the network. So that's something we're looking forward to hopefully as the U.S. recovery becomes more robust. That should give us another leg in this operating leverage.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "I guess not to harp on this, but following up on Bill Greene's question on the share repurchases. You guys have a lot of cash. Your balance sheet isn't over-levered. What's really the danger here for you guys to push ahead? Because it feels like, and maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but waiting, you're obviously going to end up buying back the stock at a higher price. And I think shareholders would rather see you guys buying now rather than later. What's the downside consequence for just going ahead? If S&P were to downgrade you guys, what's the impact to the company?", "D. Davis", "I think there\u2019s very little likelihood of S&P downgrading us given the incredible momentum we've got. But we did basically tell them our intentions; to get those financial ratios robust. We think, given the expectation of our current momentum being far beyond even where we thought we were at the beginning of the year, that there's a good possibility that we will talk with them and have a little better view. So we're not totally beholding to them, but we also don't like the negative outlook. We don't think it's appropriate and we intended to demonstrate the financial capacity before we got more aggressive. But we committed five years ago to a policy of returning basically 100% of net income to shareowners, either in the form of share repurchase or dividends. I think Scott and I remain committed to that program. We do think that the stock is a bargain right now and hopefully we these results, we\u2019ll get that one little minor cloud cleared up and then we'll find what the best way to redistribute to shareowners is.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel Nicolaus.", "David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "A first question on the purchase transportation. The costs were up significantly year-over-year in the quarter. I know a decent amount of that is fuel; some is volume increases. Can you just kind of talk about that line [indiscernible] a little bit? How much might be volume versus fuel versus network, adjustments where you bought purchase transportation instead of adding UPS capacity?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, that line has a lot of moving parts now, especially as we\u2019ve become a larger and larger forwarder. So the single biggest impact is the substantial growth we had in our Forwarding unit. Tonnage was up about 30% in the quarter. And on top of that, rates are dramatically higher than they were last year. So the lion's share of that increase would be directly related to the Forwarding and the increased rates. Following that, certainly within our International business, we have a substantial amount of purchase transportation, either for agents or transportation. So with the dramatic 20% unit growth in International, that's also up. And then the smaller part domestically would be fuel and there\u2019s also [indiscernible] in there. So it\u2019s really a relation of the Forwarding and International growth, both of which were in excess of 20%.", "David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "In fact, congratulations on being named in the President\u2019s Export Council. It\u2019s good to hear that a business leader is actually on that Council.", "D. Davis", "It\u2019s very important, I think. We talked earlier about the need in the U.S. to get small business people to export. And I think the ability to help get out and train some of them on the ease of exporting. And we\u2019ve identified 7,000 or 8,000 customers right now that export to just one country, and we're going to try to get them to go to at least two countries, and we think that's very possible. So I think it's very important for the country to get employment going again and to get small business exporting.  We talked about 96% of the consumers outside the U.S. They need to understand that.", "David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I understand. But do you think it's possible to double exports over the next five years, given current capacity constraints and trade policies?", "D. Davis", "Yes, I think that it will all go hand-in-hand.  I guess it's stretched gold, but I think that we are going to have to get more accommodative trade policies. It starts with free trade agreements with Korea, Colombia and Panama, and that's certainly part of what we're trying to work on on the Council.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And I think a little closer to home, UPS is working like crazy to lowering the barriers to doing trade globally. That's why things like our paperless invoice, import control, all of that stuff, just trying to automate things that used to be very confusing for small and midsize customers. So that's why we're so obsessed with technology and the ease of use. If we make it easy and the government facilitates it, then we think there's a lot of latent capabilities in U.S. small business to grow.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Mr. John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Just a question back on the Domestic volume growth. If we are in for a more protracted level of modest growth, this kind of 1%, 1.5%, maybe 2% GDP for a protracted period of time, the reorganization that you just completed in the Domestic Package business, is that enough cost reduction to sustain the margins where they were this quarter through a protracted period of maybe slower growth in the Domestic business?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think, John, it's our intention to increase margins. So no, absolutely. We've aligned ourselves in a number of ways to be able to continue to get margins growing and back, hopefully over time, to where they were in our peaks. So from a peer cost perspective, absolutely. And I think there's also strategic positioning in our restructuring, maybe that Scott can talk about a bit.", "D. Davis", "I think part of the restructuring was all about going to the customer and getting local control over operations and our marketing. And I think that we're just getting to the beginning of that process. We\u2019re taking marketing to all the districts right now. It used to be done out of Corporate. Every one of our markets are somewhat different. And I think the fact that we have this expertise now, looking for different segments, looking at micro marketing, is going to help our business.  And it\u2019s not going to do it overnight. We're going to see more benefit in the second half of the year than we saw in the first half of the year. We'll see more benefit in 2011 than we saw in 2010. So I think it\u2019s a combination. Sure, we\u2019re going to save some costs, but I think the fact that we're giving more autonomy to our local operations, more decision-making to our local operations, will help us run a better business.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "The one thing I was a little bit surprised about in your answers in terms of the use of cash and the return of it, there wasn\u2019t a lot of discussion there on maybe some of your growth initiatives or your acquisition outlook. Could you elaborate a little bit on that in terms of where that fits in the whole scheme of use of cash on a go-forward basis?", "D. Davis", "Clearly, John, we're going to be looking at opportunities [indiscernible] business. And I said many times before, our focal points are really going to be on the International Package business, starting with Asia and then probably Central and Eastern Europe. Clearly there are opportunities out there that fit our needs, that add to our strengths as far as capabilities or lanes that we need to strengthen. We\u2019ll take advantage of that. So that never is far from our couriers just using cash [ph]. We're always looking at the right acquisitions. In the Freight Forwarding/Logistics world, again, if we find areas that will fortify trade lanes or add capabilities and logistics, we'll take a look at those also. So it\u2019s a combination certainly of acquisitions, investing into the business and distributing cash to shareowners.", "Kurt Kuehn", "John, our outlook though for cash flow is very positive for the next couple of years, with the completion of our Worldport air hub with the, really, replenishment and replacement of all the older aircraft in our fleet. Our capital needs for the next few years are going to be significantly below the trend, even with strong growth. So we are just in a good position of having a lot of choices right now with what we do with discretionary cash. And certainly, growth would be the top priority.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "A couple of items. In your view, is any of the strength that you're seeing, particularly in the International volumes, reflective of maybe shippers looking to get ahead of the curve a little bit with regard to peak season because they\u2019re worried about capacity availability?", "D. Davis", "Yes, Chris, I do think that there may be some of that. And that was part of my intention in my comments talking about the ocean squeeze and some of that. I think a number of our customers, and this is direct from our sales customers, did feel exposed last peak season and got in a jam. That\u2019s why there was such chaos trying to get goods out of Asia in late November and December. And so there's a little bit of that \u201cnot this time\u201d mentality. So we do think that people are pushing stuff through a little earlier. And as they see the constraints on the ocean side, then it may make for an earlier air peak season also.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Do you think enough of that is happening that it will alter somewhat the normal seasonality as we go through the balance of the year?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I don't know. I think right now, it\u2019s way too early to afford to be impacting air freight, but air freight continues to be strong. So it will be an interesting year, I think, as we come back. Assuming the economy stays reasonably strong, then it could be a fairly interesting time as there is some backlog, I think, on the ocean side already. The slow steaming, in effect, takes substantial capacity out. So a lot of companies that wouldn't normally think about using air freight earlier in the holiday season have been talking about that.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then a follow-up. To the extent you're having high level discussions with customers about export and their strategic outlook, do you get any sense from customers that they are waiting for more clarity either on the policy front or the legislative front to make investments or to grow their businesses? Are people kind of sitting on their hands waiting for the government to kind of settle out?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think, clearly, policy uncertainty is one of the worst things for a recovery. And I think that the sooner we get some of these issues resolved, whether it be energy, we\u2019ve got healthcare I guess somewhat resolved at this point in time, the sooner small businesses will get to spend their money again and bring in hired employees. So there's no doubt that policy uncertainty is an issue out there. We need to resolve that to get this recovery going full-steam.", "Operator", "And our last question in queue will come from the line of Mr. Chris Combe of Exane.", "Christopher Combe - Exane SA", "I had a follow-up to Robin's question on European, both international, domestic and export yields. You gave some color x Turkey. Could you also give us some sense of how much of an FX effect you had, given the quite a significant impact from Q1 and some euro-dollar development, and if anything worked against your favor a bit?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. Actually, due to the impact of our hedging, the currency was actually not a huge impact. But we do show currency-adjusted yields. Export yields do show increases. Without currency, it would be just a little bit lower. So no, we're seeing very good strength on our export side, good pricing power, and also the increased weight. The other big thing that's happened, and we saw a little bit of a shift, the Transcontinental, the Europe-Asia to U.S., really was stronger than the intraregional shipments. And typically, the yields on those long-distance flights are much higher. So all in all, very strong pricing and we're very comfortable that those trends will continue.", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis & Co", "And just one quick follow-up. In terms of the trade-up effect that you referred to, are you seeing any signs of that within the European market?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we are actually. In Europe, we offer this very integrated range of services from standard to express with no time commitment or afternoon commitments and early morning. And we are seeing a little bit of a shift across all of those up, just as the economy heats up. And frankly, as we work with customers in Europe to help them re-align their supply chains, you reduce your warehouses and you use a little more speed in your transportation network. So that trend has also helped the yield.", "Operator", "That concludes our Q&A session today. I will now turn the program back over to Mr. Andy Dolny.", "Andy Dolny", "Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Scott for final comments.", "D. Davis", "xxx", "Thanks, Andy. By any measure, UPS produced a great quarter. While we've made good progress across all the business units, we still have a lot more to accomplish. The UPSs around the world will continue to work extremely hard to help our customers compete in the growing global marketplace. And as a result, we\u2019re very excited about the outlook for UPS' future. Thanks so much for joining us today, and we'll see you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call, the UPS Second Quarter Earning Call.

My name is Steve, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and our outlook for 2011. Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language.", "Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 Form 10-K and 2010 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast, and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website.", "In our earnings announcement today, you'll notice that we recognized a gain of $71 million on the sale of UPS Logistics Technologies Inc. This gain was offset somewhat by $13 million in additional guarantees relating to the German specialized transportation company that we sold in the first quarter. The net effect of these two events provided an after-tax benefit of $32 million or $0.03 per share. Excluding this transaction, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.08.", "In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS's fourth quarter 2010 results, excluding the impact of this gain. Additionally, all 2010 full-year references and comparisons to 2009 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is the most accurate picture of the company's performance.", "Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. The schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the financial section.", "Lastly, mark your calendars. I'm pleased to announce that UPS will be hosting an investor conference in Louisville, Kentucky on September 14 and 15. We look forward to showcasing our flagship facilities, highlighting our many capabilities and communicating our plans for the future. More details will be forthcoming.", "Now to begin our review, I'll turn the program over to Scott.", "D. Davis", "Good morning, everyone. Today, UPS reported another quarter of significant growth in revenue and operating profit, with earnings up 44%. These extraordinary results were directly attributable to the superb execution of UPSers around the globe, during an environment of improving economic conditions. ", "For example, here in the U.S., increased consumer confidence, combined with slightly better employment picture, produced strong retail sales spurred by double-digit e-commerce growth.", "In a moment, Kurt will take you through a detailed review of UPS performance. But first, I want to spend a few minutes reflecting on 2010. The appropriate place to start is to say I'm extremely proud of how UPSers collaborated to position the company for success. Much was achieved this past year, and I would like to highlight some of our accomplishments.", "I am most impressed with our balanced performance across all business segments. For the year, U.S. Domestic and International operating profits on a combined basis, are up more than 40% and Supply Chain and Freight up 95%, with the International Supply Chain and Freight segments hitting record levels. ", "In 2010, UPS wrapped up key infrastructure projects, including the completion of the Worldport expansion and the addition of a new inter-Asia hub in Shenzhen, China.", "We continue to execute our strategy for growth by expanding the UPS brand in emerging markets and growing developing lines of business. We announced several important milestones in these areas, including strategic alliances with UPS service partners in Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, the expansion of the world's largest service parts logistics network by adding over 100 new locations in China and just last month, a significant buildup of our global health care network, with new distribution centers in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Canada. While we were busy growing new business, 2010 was also a year of change and transition at UPS. The restructuring of the U.S. domestic business was one of the most significant in UPS history. We streamlined the organization and introduced our localized go-to-market strategy. Although some of the benefits have been realized, the full impact will be more evident in 2011 and beyond.", "In addition, we introduced a new global communications platform, along with an advertising campaign that highlights the power of logistics and the strength of UPS solutions. ", "Not only are we acknowledged for our expertise in enabling global trade, but once again, UPS was distinguished for its leadership in community, diversity and environmental sustainability. For example, UPS's employees were recognized for their continued support of the United Way, as the first company to surpass $1 billion in combined contributions. Our company received the number one industry ranking by the climate count score card for the second consecutive year. ", "And we were honored when President Obama asked UPS to participate in his Export Council, working alongside other business leaders to support the goal of doubling U.S. exports in the next five years. Yes, 2010 was an eventful year at UPS.", "As we look forward to 2011, I am encouraged by recent events that will quicken the pace of economic recovery in the months and years ahead. One such event is the recent U.S. tax law change. While I would like to see a more permanent solution, this is an important move in the right direction and should foster a more dynamic recovery in 2011. ", "Businesses are in a much better position to make critical decisions with a greater understanding of what the impact will be to their bottom line. Clearly, this is reflected in the recent upward revisions in the 2011 economic indicators for the U.S. As UPS developed our guidance for 2011, we also considered the current state of the global economy and the fact that 2010 growth rates varied widely across the world.", "Some countries exhibited solid increases in economic output like Germany, with its strongest growth in almost 30 years, while other countries in Europe experienced almost no expansion at all. This economic pattern is expected to continue. Many of the world's top economies are forecast to expand at a slower pace, leading to the overall expectation of moderate global growth in 2011.", "Even with this forecast, 2011 is going to be another great year for UPS. Our industry-leading margins and superior financial strength uniquely position UPS to continue investing for growth.", "We expect revenue and margin expansion, driving earnings per share above previous peak levels. We will further expand our unique global portfolio of services, and create leverage through our superior operating model. This gives us great confidence in our ability to provide superior returns to UPS investors.", "Now, let me turn it over to Kurt.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Wow, what a difference a year makes. In 2010, earnings per share were up 54% to $3.56, and revenue jumped more than 9% to almost $50 billion. Operating profits moved higher, up $1.9 billion or 47%. The measures we put in place, combined with outstanding execution in an improving economic environment, led to these great results.", "Now, looking specifically at the fourth quarter. Revenue climbed 8.4% on a 3.9% increase in volume. Operating profit increased $500 million to $1.8 billion, up 40% over last year. Operating margins rebounded to 13.1%, a 290-basis point gain. ", "It's true that rising fuel prices and challenging weather conditions were headwinds during the quarter. Our operators in the U.S. and abroad did a great job managing through these conditions. All in all, we were successful in controlling our costs, as compensation and benefit expense again increased at a slower pace than volume.", "Regarding peak season. Small improvements in the economy gave consumers enough confidence to return to more traditional holiday shopping patterns, and UPS was ready. Looking across the globe, peak season is more than just a U.S. phenomena. On peak day across the world, UPS delivered 25 million packages, processed 3 million pieces through our expanded Worldport facility and handled 48 million tracking requests with UPS technology.", "Now, let's look at our segment performance starting with U.S. Domestic. Total revenue was up 7% to $8.1 billion on an average daily volume increase of 1.7%, with Next Day Air volume up 2.6% and ground up 2%. Remember, these daily growth rates were negatively impacted by an additional operating day that fell between Christmas and New Years in 2010.", "Revenue per piece improved 3.5%. The yield improvements were primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and our ability to retain a larger portion of the general rate increase, as customers recognize the value we provide.", "Operating margin improved to 12.9%, up 280 basis points. Our management team effectively controlled expense during the quarter, with key operating statistics like direct-labor hours, miles driven and block hours, all down from last year.", "Now, let's review our International performance. As you may recall, this segment reported strong results in the fourth quarter of 2009. As capacity in the air freight market was constrained, benefiting international express. Despite tough comps, the Q4 2010 story is a good one. Operating profit increased 15% to $537 million, with margin expansion of 90 basis points. The industry's best margin of 17.6% was driven by volume growth and our ability to drive operating leverage.", "Export volumes reached new highs, approaching 1 million deliveries per day, up almost 9%. All regions showed improvements, with notable gains in Asia and Europe. China continued to impress, up more than 30%, and our largest operation, Germany, experienced double-digit growth.", "Our non-U.S. Domestic strategy is focused on managing growth while improving profitability. In the fourth quarter, average daily volume was over 1.5 million packages, up 2.4%. Clearly, this growth was adversely affected by the worst weather that Europe has seen in decades. ", "As we grow around the world, we continue to set new records. For the full year, International operating profits were more than $1.9 billion, with average daily volume of 2.3 million packages. Both of these are new highs for UPS.", "In order to capitalize on the growth in global trade, we made significant expansions to the UPS global air network. For example during 2010, we increased capacity for key Asian lanes to the U.S. and Europe by over 40%.", "Now, turning to the Supply Chain and Trade segment. 2010 was a record-setting year for this segment also. Operating profits almost doubled to $577 million on a revenue increase of 17%. ", "For the quarter, operating profit jumped more than 500% to $176 million, with all business units contributing. Revenue increased 12.8% to $2.3 billion, driven primarily by Forwarding and UPS Freight.", "Forwarding revenue returned to normal fourth quarter trends, as supply in the global air freight market more closely aligned with demand. Revenue management initiatives, coupled with better equilibrium in the air freight market drove strong profit improvements.", "In the Logistics business unit, margin expanded as customers in the healthcare and high-tech industries recognize the value of our distribution expertise. ", "We continue to see increasing demand for our healthcare solutions. This is coming from all types of organizations, including pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies. ", "But UPS healthcare resources go far beyond our brick-and-mortar distribution facilities. They also include the largest transportation network in the world, offering customers both small package and freight solutions, and we continue to invest and expand capabilities across the entire portfolio.", "Recently, UPS announced a significant expansion of its global healthcare distribution network. New facilities are being added in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Canada to accommodate our rapid growth in healthcare. UPS freight clearly outpaced the market, as it posted substantial revenue growth, up almost 23%, with an 11% gain in LTL shipments per day.", "Revenue per hundredweight increased 8.7%, one of the strongest in the industry. Yield benefited from our focus on the middle market and the ability to offer technology in bundled solutions. The early general rate increase also contributed to this improvement.", "Clearly, the disciplined strategy employed by UPS Freight over the past several quarters is paying off. We are seeing both strong growth and improved operating profit, though work still needs to be done to fully achieve our goals.", "Now, let's talk about cash flow. Even after making an additional $2 billion in discretionary pension contributions in the fourth quarter, UPS generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow for the year. Efficient use of capital and a strong balance sheet continue to be a hallmark of UPS. ", "In 2010, we paid $1.8 billion in dividends, reflecting a 4.4% increase per share, invested $1.4 billion in capital expenditures and spent more than $800 million to repurchase approximately 12 million shares.", "As I mentioned last quarter, we were considering accelerated pension contributions. And given the low levels of interest rates, we thought it was financially prudent to issue debt to pre-fund our pension plans.", "In November, we issued $2 billion in 10- and 30-year notes at very attractive rates. For example, our 10-year notes have a coupon rate of only 3 1/8%. The proceeds from this debt were immediately contributed to our pension plans.", "In January 2011, another $1.2 billion in cash was also contributed to our plans. As a result, UPS defined benefit pension plans, are now over 100% funded. The financing was balance sheet neutral and the overall transaction was a great move for UPS shareowners and will substantially reduce contributions in the years to come.", "As we\u2019d previously discussed, UPS, like most companies with defined benefit plans, will experience higher pension expense in 2011 as a result of lower discount rates and the amortization of the 2008 market losses. The benefits of our recent pension contributions will help offset the impact, but not totally eliminate it. We do expect a 2011 pension expense headwind of approximately $0.07.", "Regarding our funds flow from operations-to-debt metric, we ended 2010 at 47%. Note that we've decided to modify our calculation for FFO-to-debt to incorporate pension liabilities. Based on this formula, we expect to significantly exceed 50% by the end of this year. ", "As far as our outlook for 2011, economic expectations call for modest growth, but we expect a record-setting year for UPS, with earnings per share reaching an all-time high. We anticipate earnings in a range of $4.12 to $4.35 per share, an increase of 16% to 22%. ", "Looking at the first quarter, there will be some challenges with currency headwinds and certainly, the significant weather events we've had so far this year. Nonetheless, we expect the year-over-year growth rate for the first quarter earnings to be similar to that for the year overall.", "In the U.S. Domestic segment, average daily volume should increase in line with GDP growth. Revenue will rise in the mid- to high-single digits, and the operating profit growth rate will be in the mid to upper teens. Operating margins should continue their rebound, improving on a year-over-year basis. ", "Current estimates call for a modest decline in the rate of growth for global GDP in 2011. Despite this, the International segment expects revenue and operating profit growth of approximately 10%.", "For the first half of 2011, year-over-year comparisons will be impacted primarily by benefits received from currency hedging in 2010 and a slightly weaker euro. As a result, the first half operating margins should see slight year-over-year declines. In the second half, margins will expand over last year, and we expect full-year operating margins to be similar to 2010.", "For Supply Chain and Freight, we expect to see mid- to high-single digit revenue growth, with modest margin expansion and operating profit improving in the low to mid teens percent. Our overall tax rate for 2011 should be between 34% and 35%. So all in all, 2011 should be a good year of solid operating performance. ", "Now, let's talk about our plans for cash. 2011 will be another great year, continuing our investments in growth opportunities. Capital expenditures are projected to be $2.2 billion or about 4% of revenue. We will look for ways to take advantage of the accelerated depreciation opportunity that exists.", "UPS is also committed to significantly increasing distributions to shareowners. Share repurchases are expected to increase substantially, moving from $800 million in 2010 to approximately $2 billion in 2011. And dividends will continue to be a high priority for the company. ", "As we close the books on 2010, the tough decisions we've made over the last few years have positioned UPS well for the future, leading us to anticipated record earnings per share in 2011.", "Thanks for your attention. And now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jon Langenfeld of Robert W. Baird.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Good morning. Could you talk about some of the metrics within the Domestic business, specifically how weight per shipment is trending and then how your effective wage rate is flowing up, given all the puts and takes for turnover and new hiring?", "D. Davis", "Yes, Jon. Sure. I'd be glad to. In general, we had great operating results in the fourth quarter, with miles per driver and our direct labor hours down as compared to volumes. Our wage rates in aggregate were up about 3%. We continue to have a very high proportion of our drivers that are full-time rate. But as growth continues, we do see some moderating trends along those lines. So a little bit of growth then continued operational execution, and we should be in pretty good shape.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then on the yield side within Domestic, how should we think about that? I mean 3% with fuel prices rising, hopefully, weight per shipment was going up. That was a little bit lower on the ground side than what I might have anticipated. So where am I missing out? Because it sounds like you described the pricing environment as continuing to be very healthy.", "D. Davis", "Yes, it is. Absolutely. The absolute base rates were up a couple percent. Clearly, the overall yield increases were a greater impact than the fuel was. There is a little bit of a lag on the fuel. Weight actually has flattened out. We\u2019ve not seen increasing weight, and so there's been no tailwind from that yet.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Also, on the fourth quarter, Jon, the retail segment really performed the strongest and generally you'll see a little lighter weights on the retail side.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I want to see if you could provide a little bit further perspective on how we would think on pricing, I guess, it's kind of a little follow-on to the prior question. But do you think that versus your comment of base rates up a few percent in fourth quarter that, that would accelerate a bit as we go through 2011? And I guess any further comments on kind of just the competitive environment in general in Domestic Package?", "D. Davis", "Yes. In general, we've been pleased with a rational and stable pricing environment. We did have our annual rate increase that kicked in, in January. And overall, the acceptance of that has been positive, so we do expect continual, gradual firming and improvement in the yield management and pricing arena. So far so good on that front, and we're certainly seeing that in our long-term improvements and margins, and we do see the environment as stable.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And I guess for the follow-up question, you mentioned that your guidance for 2011 implies that you're going to exceed prior peak earnings, which is great to see. If you look at Domestic Package margin, I would assume that you're still probably going to be quite a bit below your prior peak of, call it, 84-ish type of operating ratio. Do you think that if you look the next two years, there's a chance that you return to prior peak in Domestic Package margin?", "D. Davis", "Tom, we do feel very confident that margins will expand. And we've been pleased with the progress, and I think the Domestic business has recovered ahead of schedule, and that's why we've been thrilled to be confident that we will exceed peak earnings this year. The exact timing of when margins do return up to their high levels will depend on how the economy recovers. Certainly, the weight conditions and the revenue conditions. So we're highly confident, we're improving margins but we're at this point, we're not ready to draw a line in the sand on exactly when we'll hit what margins.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Clearly, Tom, we're looking at a strong 2011. And Domestics will show the biggest margin expansion of any of the three segments next year. So we're seeing a lot of progress there.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trajan.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "When I just look at the Next Day Air yields, sequentially they look to me to be down about 4%. And fuel, obviously, went up during that period, so I'm trying to understand what might be impacting the Next Day Air, or am I looking at this wrong on the yields?", "D. Davis", "No. You're absolutely looking at it right. That was a number that did move quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter. The biggest factor on that really, Ed, was a shift in the mix component that -- the third quarter, we saw good growth in our industrial side, manufacturing side. And as we moved into the fourth quarter, as Scott mentioned, the retail segment really kicked in, certainly the holidays being a part of that. So we actually saw lower weights in the air, Next Day Air most notably and also, more use of our Saber product or afternoon product which tends to be more prevalent in retail. So, we don't see it anything structural. We see it as just the nature of the fourth quarter that kicked in. So in general, the base rates look good, it was really just an issue that the mix changed quite a bit quarter-to-quarter.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "The $0.07 pension headwind, I just want to clarify, that was net of your contributions, the $0.07 headwind? And then if you could give a guidance on the LCL OR, like you did last time, is it modestly profitable? Was it more profitable than third quarter? Can you give us a sense on that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, the pension is the outlook for 2011 with the 60 basis points, or so reduction in discount rate. That did cause an actual increase expense year-over-year even with the funding. The biggest issue is the amortization of the losses from 2008, that given the nature of pension accounting which can be pretty arcane, those losses are smoothed out over a number of years, and so that's kicking in a little bit. Having said that, we're pleased that it did end up just being a $0.07 impact and over time, certainly if those contributions that we put in generate good earnings, we should be in great shape pension-wise. I made brief comment about substantial reduction in future funding. We could be upwards of $1 billion saved in the next several years of required contributions having done this full funding. So we're in great shape on the pension.", "D. Davis", "And then on the LTL question, I'd say we are modestly profitable for the fourth quarter. But the good thing there is that, generally expect the third quarter to be more profitable than the fourth quarter due to seasonality. And we really held our own in the fourth quarter with the third. So good progress in that segment.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "You talked a bit about aircraft growing about 40% in between U.S., Asia, Europe. Can you talk about what kind of level you plan to invest to maintain your kind of near double-digit international growth?", "D. Davis", "We are certainly continuing to expand the air fleet. And for 2011, we expect to take delivery of two 747-400s, which are certainly flagship assets in the International and another five 767s. So that should put us in good stead and serve us well. And as I mentioned, we continue to get great benefits from the expanded Worldport that's allowed us to make better use of those aircraft assets, in some cases, making the Domestic network more efficient and freeing up assets for International.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So as you see that growth, is that meeting your 8% to 10% international growth? Is there something you need to make to make further investments to capture more than that as you see it picking up? Or is it just more efficiency of unused utilization of that aircraft?", "D. Davis", "No. The aircraft we\u2019re in good shape for. Certainly, those increases will be fine, and we'll continue to make investments around the globe and on the ground assets, sector expansion like healthcare and expanding our hubs where we need it. But the aircraft we\u2019re in good shape here.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And Ken, we're flexible in that we carry a fair amount of cargo also, and as the Package business grows, we can take cargo off and fly packages and use common carriage for the cargo.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Kurt, in your guidance of the 16% to 22%, can you talk a little bit about what kind of growth levels you anticipate maybe on the ground or any of the specifics on overall volume growth you're targeting within that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. We expect the Domestic package market to grow in line with GDP, and we're estimating GDP somewhere around 3%, maybe a little higher. We'll see how the stimulus works. So our Ground business and our Next Day Air business should grow at or slightly above that, and our deferred business may grow a little below that range. But we feel pretty good that both the Next Day Air and the Ground Product will show good solid growth this year.", "D. Davis", "And Ken, it's encouraging for us that we're expecting industrial production again to outperform GDP in 2011. So most people look at IP growing over 4% this year, which is encouraging.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Malat of Goldman Sachs.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "For International, probably more specifically in Europe, how do we think about the balance between margins and share gains? You said margins are going to be relatively flat. Should we think of this as a function of margins already at pretty high levels? Maybe the focus is a bit more on taking share rather than increasing margins from here?", "D. Davis", "Absolutely. Our top priority in International is growth. And we've been thrilled with the return to peak margins, 17.6% in the fourth quarter. So when you\u2019ve got the best business model, when you've got double the margins of your competitors, growth is priority, and that will remain the focus. The one headwind at the International is that we did smooth out the impact of a declining euro last year. And so some of those comps year-over-year, the euro will be a headwind. Could be as much as $100 million or so because of our hedging that we've done several years ago that helped us smooth out the significant decline we've seen in the euro. So that really puts the \u2013 that\u2019s the primary issue that's putting the headwind to the margin, but our priority is growth. But overall, the global economy, we're pretty optimistic for 2011. While a lot of people think it won\u2019t grow quite as much as it did last year, it's still going to grow in the upper 3% level. Strong growth out of Asia. China, the GDP was 10\u00bd% last year. It will be high nines this year, it\u2019ll be a little slower but still real strong growth. Europe, there's some concern that there may be some moderation but we're really seeing maybe a tenth or two less growth in the economy in Europe this year versus last year. So overall, it's a pretty good environment for UPS to grow International.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just on compliance rates on fuel surcharge, historically as fuel moves up, we get a little bit lower compliance rates, is that still the case? You get a little bit less of an impact than you did in the past? How do we think about that as we go through the year?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Certainly, as fuel spikes, that becomes a big issue. At this point, compliance is reasonably stable. Clearly it's not a 100%, but we are able to get a significant majority of the rates. As fuel moves over a $100 a barrel and goes even higher, there's some risk to that. Although one thing we have done in the last couple of years is we did narrow the difference between the air surcharge and the ground surcharge, especially if fuel spikes. So we think that will buffer, to some extent, pressure on compliance and also hopefully minimize the trade down impact that was so challenging for us a few years ago.", "D. Davis", "But certainly, with what's going in Egypt, we'll pay attention to that. But again, our biggest problem with compliance was when fuel got to $120, $130, $140 a barrel. Fortunately, we have a ways to go and hopefully we will not hit that in the near-term.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Can I just ask you, you referenced the strength of the online retailers. How big was B2C in the fourth quarter? Did it approach 50% of volumes?", "D. Davis", "Not for the quarter overall. Certainly, there was some time during December when it was that or more during those last couple of peak weeks. Overall, for the quarter, it was about 35% though.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And the growth rate year-over-year for B2C?", "D. Davis", "It was in the mid- to upper-single digits. It had flattened out a little bit during the summer, but it did come back in pretty strong. Although frankly, the one thing that did offset the peak a little bit is very late in peak and into that week after peak, things did cool off quite a bit.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then how about inventories broadly? I think there's a sense that the inventory to sales ratio is pretty low. Does that suggest we could see surprises on the Air side in 2011? How do you think about where your customer inventories are?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Bill, I do think inventory to sales ratios are still pretty low, historically they\u2019re pretty low, maybe not at the very bottom. But I think it bodes pretty well for replenishing inventories this year, which again combining that with a pretty strong IP year, should help the Air business. So we're expecting good Next Day growth in 2011.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Were you referring to Domestic?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Domestic. Correct.", "Unidentified Analyst", "But not -- the export\u2019s not where you would expect to see the big surprise?", "Kurt Kuehn", "From the U.S. exports' standpoint, I'm still optimistic. I\u2019m part of the Export Council, our jobs are to double exports the next five years, and I think I'm optimistic you'll see good growth in U.S. exports.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "Just a couple on the Domestic business. Scott, during the prepared remarks, you said something about the restructuring being more impactful in 2011. Just wondered if you could elaborate on whether there are any other shoes we should expect to drop there during the course of the year that will be helpful.", "D. Davis", "No, I think we had a very successful transformation in 2010. And in 2011, clearly, we have 12 months of the benefits with less people and compensation expenses. But I think the real key is the marketing, the local marketing, going to work. And we're doing a much better job as we've decentralized and given more authority to our presence in the districts. They've got a marketing staff, they're able to direct the sales force better than in the past. I think what you'll see is better target marketing, and that will benefit us 2011, 2012 and beyond.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "If I could piggyback on part of the answer to a question that I think Tom was asking. If you take a look at the past four quarters where you had peakish margins around 16% in the Domestic business and they're down to 13% now, you've restructured, you're more efficient. Is the erosion explainable entirely by the price impact that we saw in '08 and '09, or is there some other factor that we should be thinking of that needs to turn in order for you to get back to those kinds of levels?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, clearly, the go-go economy of 2007 is not fully back yet. So if you look at the industries, the manufacturing, some of those things, we're not really back to peak economic output, I think, across the U.S. as we were. So yes, we do have about a couple of hundred basis point gap still that we'd like to work towards. We are guiding to mid to upper teens income growth for this year. So clearly, that will get us a good piece of that. But it's a number of factors. It's continued prudent management of yields. We're not trying to make up for a few years of declines with one big step so we're being prudent and disciplined on yield management. Weights hopefully will continue to come back as the business and manufacturing side of the economy continue to grow. And then us continuing our big focus on operational technology and efficiencies, so it's the sum total of many things but we feel pretty good with guiding to mid to upper teens improvements and profits for the year.", "D. Davis", "The only thing I'll add to that, Kurt, is that, clearly, that the wage rate will benefit us. Right now, we\u2019re still having an effective labor wage rate higher than our contract rate. And as we get the volume growth, the effective rate should go below the contract rate which will be beneficial to margins.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "Clearly, a great quarter in Q4 given the challenges of fuel and weather. I was curious, as you look back at Q4 and you look out now towards Q1, as we're supposed to get an ice storm here in New York today. This isn't an outdoor sport, but what do you think was the impact of weather in Q4 and thus far, how bad has the impact on your Domestic network and even in Europe been in Q1?", "D. Davis", "First of all, all of you New Yorkers are as tired of the weather as we are. It's been a rugged one. Clearly, Europe, the worst weather I think in the U.K. in 60 years. Had a big impact on us. But January, there really hasn't been a good, clean week in January so far, week after week. We're still, as Kurt said in his guidance, we\u2019re optimistic for the first quarter but if this carries on for another two, three, four weeks, there's going to be pressure on the first quarter. Right now, we do a pretty good job of operating through it. Our people have done a great job. But this kind of weather, it certainly impairs the economy and you're going to see, I think, in January, some weakened retail sales numbers and other numbers due to the impact of the weather.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. I think if you look at Q4, the primary impact was on the demand side. It clearly had an impact on our European Domestic services. The Export business isn't quite as impacted, but clearly, we did show lower growth there. And frankly, that's what we're saying so far for the U.S. environment in January with growth that had been solid actually going flat or even negative for January. That's primarily where it is. I think our operations know to work around it but frankly, if businesses are shut down, it's hard to do. So hopefully, this clears up quickly and the storm this week is the last one for the quarter. But we'll continue to manage as best we can.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "When I think about the CapEx guidance that you guys gave, you talked about bonus depreciation plan, a bit of a roll there. But you also came in, I think a little light versus plan on 2010. So is there a pull through that went into 2011? And then I guess if you broke it down, what do you guys think is your maintenance CapEx right now at this point? And how much of this should we be thinking of as your mark for growth? And what is that growth going towards?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we did come in lower than we had projected on the CapEx for 2010. And frankly, a lot of that was decisions to defer projects a year or so and some of the areas will see the biggest increase. Vehicles is one of the most discretionary areas. Clearly, there'll be benefits on the depreciation side for that. Our building and facility projects, when in doubt, we tend to delay those. So there is some push from 2010 into 2011. Having said that, we are aggressively looking for opportunities where it makes sense to invest this year and next year, frankly, for some of the longer-term assets to take advantage of the rapid depreciation.", "D. Davis", "I think the best encouraging thing here is I think that what UPS is doing, most of corporate America is also going to do. When you look at this 100% depreciation that came in the tax change, it is going to encourage investment. It will help the economy, and it will create jobs. And I think that's good for all of us.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And I guess back to the second half of your question, over the long term, we think depreciation pretty fairly represents maintenance CapEx. Although with us just having completed Worldport and having substantial new capacity, we were able to reduce our CapEx below that level. So we've been investing for growth even with these historically low rates. The aircraft, we've got an all-new fleet so all of our aircraft additions are capacity expansion -- so we\u2019re investing for growth even at these low rates of capital.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "And you've focused more of this CapEx in Europe, given what the euro's doing right now? Or is that not play into your thought process?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, it's really around the globe. We've got a very large hub in Cologne that we\u2019ll likely do some expansions on. But inter-network expansions, many of those go to Europe, but we don't, we aren\u2019t particularly trying to time the euro as far as capital expansions.", "D. Davis", "Some of it will be geared around our healthcare expansion when necessarily. We're expanding healthcare in Asia, in Europe, in the Americas and so on. So, it'll be around the world as Kurt said.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Robin Byde of HSBC.", "Robin Byde - HSBC Holdings plc", "Just a more general question on fuel surcharges and mix. I was just wondering, do these apply in the same way to International Package, particularly IP Domestic as they do to U.S. Domestic? So I guess what I'm getting at here is as your mix shifts away from the U.S., does your ability to recover higher fuel cost through surcharges, does that stay the same or get more challenging?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No. Robin, I think it is very similar. They are different indexes and different levels of surcharges across the world, but we've put in very similar structures over the last few years. Our domestic markets, most of the larger markets, we do have some form of surcharge, although there are some where there isn't, but the impact of that\u2019s much less material because it's really the aircraft that consume the highest proportion of fuel. So no, we feel very good about the capability to manage yield in a rising fuel environment across the globe. And I think if you look at our currency adjusted yields for the quarter, they were quite strong. Our domestics actually show a 3% increase currency adjusted in those domestic markets. Part of that is us rationalizing some customer bases as we've had great growth. But all in all, we feel very good about the fuel surcharge across the globe and don't see any exposure there.", "Robin Byde - HSBC Holdings plc", "And just a quick follow-up on Supply Chain, you talked quite a lot about expansion of healthcare. Can you give us an indication of the margins you make in the Supply Chain segment, specifically? Or at least just say if these are higher or lower than your divisional average?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I guess I'll just talk specifically on the numbers, and then maybe Scott can expand a little bit on our healthcare strategy. But in general, our distribution and Logistics margins in healthcare are above average. And because of the value added, it takes more investment and certainly, capabilities are more challenging. But when you get it right, it is highly profitable. So we are seeing upper single-digit margins in our distribution business, Forwarding business is doing well. The only business really that still has quite a ways to go on the margin side is the LTL business that is modestly profitable but it, clearly, we expect margins to expand. And if we can continue to grow shipments 11% and yields remain firm, then we're highly confident that, that will be a very profitable business for us. So some of that is the environment improving, some of that is the benefit of us focusing on the middle market and value, and you can see the results on this quarter on the revenue side.", "D. Davis", "I think you covered it pretty well, Kurt. I think that the healthcare customers really have complex supply chains. And as a result, it requires tailored solutions for them as opposed to just standardized solutions, which should drive to higher margins and 300% response.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "In looking at the Domestic business again, and all of the questions about getting back to a peak margin, do you have any type of bubble in your employment? A group of employees maybe that are reaching the retirement age where you would get a sudden improvement in the wage rate? Or is this going to be more of a gradual event as you just continue to hire the new employees and at the lower wage rate?", "Kurt Kuehn", "That's a good question, John, and you really have to segment our workforce into two groups. On the full-time employees, the drivers primarily, it will be a gradual process. Although clearly, retirements are, I think age is extending a little bit as with the economic uncertainty. So with our full-time drivers, that will be a gradual process of retirement and really growth will drive the catalyst. On the part-timers though, that workforce is much more fluid. And what we've seen with the recession and the slow recovery is many of the part-time workers, that worked for us in college that normally would migrate to full-time jobs elsewhere, frankly have hung on to their part-time job because it's the best they can get right now. With continued economic recovery and the job market improving, we could see a substantial change in our part-time workforce and so that would have a material impact.", "D. Davis", "It\u2019s important, John, like the unemployment rate in the U.S., you need GDP to grow faster than 2\u00bd% to get it going. I think we\u2019re seeing 2\u00bd%, 3% growth. If we can get that to 3\u00bd% to 4%, you're going to see unemployment rates come down in the United States, and it will also help our situation.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then, if I'm looking at kind of the same discussion with regard to Supply Chain in the freight division, you did nice work in the last couple of quarters on getting that LTL margin back to where it needs to be or at least profitable. What does it take to get back to levels of profitability in the higher single-digit range or better? I mean is it, again, is it just the economy there or is there some additional restructuring of LTL that needs to be done in order to get back there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No. John, I think the vast majority of it is the environment. I think as both players are reporting, we still have a long ways to go for profitability in the LTL industry to get back anywhere near to typical rates. We feel very happy that we've kind of managed through what seemed to be a price war with the disciplined approach. Clearly, our yields didn't take the huge drop that many of our competitors did and we continued growing. I think what you're seeing now is as the market rationalizes, as the players that were very aggressive on price get more rational, we are seeing more growth on because we've got such a great value proposition. A little bit more time, frankly, and a better environment as all the players become a little more rational and we\u2019re highly optimistic on our great offering. We think, if anything, the market\u2019s moving towards us with this highly integrated, regional, national network all combined with technology and ease of use. So we think we\u2019re on the right track with the LTL. Clearly, it's been a humbling couple of years, but so far, so good and as the environment improves, we'll certainly bring that to the bottom line.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "It looks like you're getting pricing across-the-board. Are you getting push back from your customers? Maybe you could talk a little bit about the customer mindset these days?", "D. Davis", "Yes. I think there's always a give-and-take with pricing, and we are determined to manage this business carefully and also, gradually improve yields over time. So we're not trying to change things overnight. But every negotiation we have, certainly, it's our intent to make sure that we are compensated for the value we create. And as I mentioned earlier, we do see the pricing environment to be rational. There are times when we will decide not to pursue volume if the price seems below what we need to be compensated for our services. So it's a balancing act. We have seen, in general, good trends and the rate increase this year has been reasonably well received. There are some new wrinkles in it. We did change some of the dim weight impacts on our rates and so far, that transition has gone pretty well also.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Looking at potential acquisitions, are you seeing opportunities out there both internationally and domestically? Maybe you could touch on the M&A market?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We are always keeping our eyes open for good opportunities. We're always looking for targets to provide additional capabilities that we don't already have or may open up a new land or a territory. So that won't change. I said many times in the past though, our real focus has been in International Package in Asia, Central Europe and Eastern Europe. That hasn't really changed. I think in the Forwarding Logistics area, again, if it would expand lane coverage or add capabilities, we\u2019d be interested. So the answer is yes, we\u2019re always interested in that area.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair and Company.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "I'm wanting to talk a little bit longer-term outlook on the Logistics segment. We just talked a little bit on Kevin\u2019s question about kind of the M&A environment and Logistics. But what else do you really seek to add in that business and where could that really go in the next three to five years?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think, certainly one of the areas that we've talked about, putting an investment in and expanding our interest in is healthcare. So that's an area that again, we\u2019ll look for added capabilities around the world, look for maybe locations that we don't cover today. Many of our multinational customers have needs throughout the world, so we'll certainly address our -- I guess, our vision that way. But healthcare is always one of the areas we'd look at.", "D. Davis", "Nate, in general, with the substantial profit improvements we've been showing, we see this as a growth platform. And it's not a coincidence that as this business is operated better, we've launched a major advertising campaign, celebrating the role of Logistics and highlighting UPS's capabilities. So, we think this is an incredible area of value add for customers. Everybody's supply chains are global these days. It's not just transportation. And as we expand across the world, we do see Logistics in its broadest sense being a great platform for us. So it all fits together and having the Internet work and the Forwarding capabilities, the Distribution capabilities, the Small Package capabilities fit together, we think is a great platform for growth long-term.", "Kurt Kuehn", "We said before that Logistics is the great equalizer. It really brings a small or medium sized enterprise into the global fray. And I think that, that if the U.S. is going to double exports the next five years, small and medium sized enterprises have to drive that growth. The Logistics will help that.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "And how much current overlap? We talk about kind of the integrated potential offering? My guess is it's pretty small today in terms of your packaging customers that also use Logistics. Could you help frame that a little bit in terms of what penetration you have and where that could potentially go in the next three to five years?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It really differs by both the customer size and the portfolio. We see the best success in the very large customers today of melding all of our capabilities, they really get it. Part of the realignment of field marketing that Scott talked about, is how do we bring those capabilities to the middle market. So that's a big priority for us to take advantage of that and really begin to bring those kind of capabilities to small and medium enterprises that Scott talked about.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "And is the total size of that market just as large and potentially if not larger than what you're doing right now with the large customers?", "D. Davis", "I think it's extremely large, yes. If you look at the size of that market, if you look at \u2013 the make-up of the GDP and so much of it comes from small and medium-sized enterprises. It's a bigger market.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And Nate, I guess it takes an awful lot of work though to get to that market. It's not easy to get to. You need sales resources. You need to make it simple. That's why we've invested so much over the last three to four years in our customer-facing technologies so that it feels similar whether you're shipping freight shipments on our LTL network, air freight to Asia or small package and linking all of those together is really what you have to do in order to get to that middle market.", "D. Davis", "And on top of that, it\u2019s a huge education job just in the United States alone that trades a good thing. If you saw that last survey that came out between NBC and the Wall Street Journal, think I said, 60% of Americans think free trade agreements are bad. So it's a combination of -- big education project.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Can you give us a feel if there's been any notable disruption in your business in the Middle East given what's going on or is it not big enough to move the needle for you?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think it's really not material to our business today. I mean we certainly do business and serve Egypt, but it would not have a big impact on our business. The bigger impact and overriding concern, obviously, is the impact on energy prices and if this thing spreads. But I think that what we\u2019re paying more attention to you today, obviously, we'd like to see them get the problems resolved in Egypt. But the impact it could have on the energy could have an influence on the economy.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then I know you don't have full information quite yet, but maybe you can give us a feel for what happened in terms of market share for you in the major markets in 2010 and what you're thinking in terms of share growth in '11?", "D. Davis", "Yes, I think as you look across our portfolio, our International business was successful in gaining share, pretty much across the world. If you look either at the four big integrators or you take even more detailed view. UPS freight, we slowed our share growths for a few quarters there while the bloodbath in pricing was occurring. But clearly, the last couple of quarters, we feel highly confident that we're back to substantial share gains. Our Domestic business, all in all, if you look at the year in total, we see our share fairly stable. That business actually has got a little more difficult to measure because of the blurring between some traditional package and some of the postal volume and the lightweight volume. So you do have to look carefully at that. We report our basic product, which has a lot of lightweight postal injection in our package numbers. If you take a broader view of the market and bring a lot of that postal volume in, actually, the USPS is the second-largest player in the industry. So substantial share gains in International, we think solid share gains in our Freight business and holding market share in the Domestic is our view of 2010.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Anything different for '11?", "D. Davis", "No. I think those trends will continue. We expect to grow at market in the Domestic environment. Our International business, it just continues to be on a roll. Even Europe grew at 8% this most recent quarter as we continue to provide Pan-European solutions. Big focus on emerging markets and making sure we can bring economic connectivity to them. So we feel pretty good across all our segments that we will continue to gain share.", "Operator", "Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.", "H. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So we've danced around this a little bit. The comp and benefits as a percent of revenue, in the quarter, it was 51.1%, it's within shouting distance of your best ever fourth quarter of 50.2% in '07 and on a full-year basis, you're only about 50 bps away. And what I was just trying to get a better feel for is, do you anticipate that we'll see that sort of best ever number this year? You did talk to the effective wage rate being above the contract rate. So does that cycle through by the end of this year? Or is this more like a two- or three-year type evolution?", "D. Davis", "Peter, the comp and benefits as a percent of revenue, the good news is that's a less meaningful statistic than it was when we were primarily Domestic and primarily Small Package. As we've grown into areas like Freight Forwarding distribution and even International, the proportion of direct comp and benefits to revenue drops. So some of that is just the continued diversification of our business stream. But in general, we are seeing great operating results. The U.S. Domestic restructuring, we didn't talk a lot on the call today, but we have a tremendous number of efforts underway within operational technology enhancements. We'll actually talk about those at the investor conference in September. So there's a lot of good work going on to streamline an already efficient business, not to mention the tailwind that Scott mentioned earlier, hopefully that we see as growth continues on our average wage rate. We're very pleased with our efficiencies on managing comp and benefits. As we become more diversified globally and across our segments, that number will continue to drop, we think.", "H. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And other than yields, where else might I see from a financial standpoint, continued operating leverage? Because early on in your prepared remarks, you talked to some pretty significant operating leverage in Domestic Package.", "D. Davis", "It's a combination. It's the benefit of the restructuring we\u2019ve done, the value focus that we have and our yield management and the continued productivity. As long as we can keep our comp and benefit growing at a lower rate than volume, we're in great shape and even if there's a little inflation, we anticipate it will be substantially less than our yield.", "Kurt Kuehn", "We're still investing heavily in technology, and technology has resulted in improved productivity. And we have more to gain there.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Dolny for any further closing remarks.", "Andy Dolny", "Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Scott for closing comments.", "D. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. It was hard for us to imagine in the throes of the great recession that in just two short years, we'd be talking about record EPS levels. You may recall back then that I said, when economic trends do improve, the business landscape would be different. Some companies will be gone, others will be viable, but damaged and no longer leaders. But that UPS would emerge stronger, leaner and more customer focused, prepared to benefit from improving trends.", "UPS has emerged a much stronger company, with the best financial and competitive position in our industry, a rock-solid balance sheet, strong earnings growth and tremendous free cash flow. Thanks so much for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you next time.", "Andy Dolny", "Thanks, Scott. That concludes our fourth quarter earnings call. Thanks for participating.

My name is Steven, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO to discuss the company's results for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2011. Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language.", "Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2010 Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast, and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website.", "I want to remind you of 3 adjustments we recorded in the first quarter of last year. These charges related to the U.S. Domestic segment reorganization, the change of tax filing status of a German subsidiary and the loss on sale of a Supply Chain business. They reduced net income by $175 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.18. ", "In the remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS's first quarter 2010 (sic) [2011] results excluding the impact of these items. We believe this is the most accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the financial section.", "Now to begin our review, I'll turn the program over to Scott.", "D. Davis", "Good morning, everyone. UPS had great results this quarter, continuing the momentum we had in 2010. Earnings climbed 24% on 7% revenue growth despite the obstacles we faced like unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, skyrocketing fuel costs and some of the worst weather conditions in years. So far, the global economic recovery has been resilient, yet, the risks are a little greater than they were 3 months ago. Consensus forecasts have come down slightly, as 2011 GDP growth for the U.S. is now expected to be 2.9% and global GDP is forecast to be 3.5%.", "Employment has begun to show signs of improvement. Here in the U.S., unemployment dipped below 9% for the first time in almost two years, further evidence that the recovery continues. ", "Obviously, everyone is aware of the tragic events in Japan. UPS is one of the first to support the humanitarian efforts there, working closely with the relief agency partners in Asia. ", "UPS pledged $1 million in relief aid and has been assisting with logistics support. We have delivered many containers and truck loads of emergency supplies and equipment throughout Japan. Some of these important deliveries include emergency shelters, generators, survival kits and food supplies. UPS will continue to look for other opportunities to help the victims. While the immediate impact on the global economy and UPS is not expected to be substantial, the medium-term implications on global supply chains are still not clear. ", "Here in the U.S., it is important for us to demonstrate economic leadership and increased promotion of free trade. Expectations of the Congress will soon address pending free trade legislation that is critical to grow U.S. exports and to create new jobs. ", "The South Korean free trade agreement, that President Obama endorsed back in December, has not yet passed. This critical piece of legislation is needed to further our progress, of meeting the export council's goal of doubling U.S. exports in the next 5 years.", "Other important trade agreements like those with Colombia and Panama are still in the approval process. UPS stands ready to facilitate the growth of trade between countries once these agreements are finalized. I would like to see Colombia and Panama approved as soon as possible, however, I personally disagree with holding up the Korean agreement while waiting for approval of these other 2 FTAs.", "During the quarter, UPS continued to be active in expanding our capabilities to serve the economies of the world. For instance, UPS launched 4 direct flights from Hong Kong to Europe, making us the clear leader in guaranteed next-day delivery for this important trade lane. ", "We announced more inter-Asia flights from Tokyo to key hubs in Taipei and Guangzhou, exhibiting our commitment to Japan, and UPS formed a new strategic alliance in Colombia that will provide increased access for customers to our superior global network. ", "Earlier this month, we hosted President Obama at our Landover, Maryland facility where he announced the National Clean Fleets Partnership and made us a charter member. The UPS rolling laboratory of alternative fuel vehicles was on display for the President and his team. With one of the largest alternative fuel fleets in operation today, we are uniquely qualified to discuss issues facing companies as they evaluate their options. ", "In fact in February, we celebrated a milestone when UPS green fleet surpassed 200 million miles of service. Just recently, UPS was acknowledged as a industry leader by FORTUNE Magazine when they once again identified us as the World's Most Admired company in the delivery industry.", "UPS is rated #1 in 8 of the 9 attributes used for ranking. Some of the key attributes were quality of management, innovation, long-term investment and quality of products and services. ", "In addition, as reported by Forbes, the Reputation Institute recognized UPS as #1 in the transportation industry and #6 overall on its list of America's Most Reputable Big Companies. We will continue to operate in a way that builds both our economic performance and corporate reputation.", "All in all, it was another successful quarter for the UPS team. We've continued to produce the best results in the industry. Our focus on quality of revenue and the value of our integrated network ensures that we continue to be the best. Our innovative solutions, superior technology and efficient use of capital have UPS poised for strong growth well into the future. ", "Now let me turn it over to Kurt.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well thanks, Scott. And good morning, everyone. The UPS earnings growth story continues. Operating profit for the quarter increased $248 million, and margins expanded by 130 basis points to 11.3%. ", "UPS benefited from our superior products and our flexible integrated network. The negative effects of escalating fuel prices and difficult weather were more than offset by great execution from UPSers all around the world. ", "Now let's review how the segments performed this quarter, starting with the U.S. Domestic Package business. Operating profit jumped 29% on over 6% revenue gains. These results were driven by yield improvements and increased network efficiency. Operating margin expanded by 200 basis points. Revenue per piece grew 5% with the biggest driver being increases in base rates, as we get our prices back in line with the value we provide. ", "Higher fuel surcharges and package characteristics also contributed to the yield improvement. We are executing our strategy on focusing on the quality of revenue. The key objective of this strategy is to ensure that we are properly compensated for the value we provide customers. And this is paying off as evidenced by our strong yield gains.", "Once again, we did a great job controlling costs in the quarter. Operating efficiency improved substantially, as direct labor hours were down 3% and miles driven down 2%. This is phenomenal considering the challenging conditions we faced during the quarter. U.S. Domestic volume growth was relatively flat to last year. Clearly, this was negatively impacted by severe weather, a softer economy and the timing of Easter. ", "In 2010, the holiday buildup occurred in March, while this year, it's occurring in April. We estimate that the combination of weather and the Easter calendar had a negative impact on average daily volume of about 2% for the quarter.", "While overall, our Next Day Air was up about 1%, Next Day Package volume grew at mid-single-digit rate, reflecting our focus on the quality of revenue. ", "During the quarter, UPS made a substantial commitment to expand our fleet of Liquefied Natural Gas tractors. Later this year, the 48 new LNG tractors will join our fleet of almost 2,000 alternative fuel vehicles. We're encouraged by the ability of this technology to offer an alternative to diesel fuel for large over-the-road vehicles.", "Now let's turn to the International segment. Revenue increased 10% with a solid operating margin of 15.4%. The operating profit of $446 million is the best first quarter result in UPS history. Although year-over-year earnings growth did slope to 4.4%. ", "Clearly, the rapid increase in fuel cost had a negative impact. As we stated during our last call, the first quarter of 2010 benefited from our euro hedging program. This negatively affected the year-over-year comparisons by about $30 million. Average daily export volume increased over 7%, outpacing the market. We continue to see strong export growth in Europe to all regions of the world, as customers there recognize the benefits of the UPS value proposition.", "International Package yields grew 4.5% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by higher rates, fuel surcharge increases and product mix. ", "UPS was active during the quarter, adding capacity to our Asian Air network. In addition to the direct flights from Hong Kong to Cologne and the new routes from Japan that Scott mentioned earlier, we also upsized our capacity serving the import in South Korea to U.S. trade lane, with the addition of a 767 flying in and out of Incheon. ", "Further emphasizing the breadth of solutions we provide, in March, UPS opened the 2012 Olympic Games Logistics Center in England. This is an important milestone that will allow UPS to deliver the games. We are responsible for virtually all distribution and logistic services for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.", "Now for the Supply Chain and Trade segment, which continues to produce strong results. Operating profits climbed 44% on revenue growth of 7.6%, driven primarily by improvements in UPS Freight and the Forwarding business unit. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 6.1%. ", "In the Forwarding unit, operating margin improved significantly, as capacity in the market expanded and buy rates came down. Top line growth moderated somewhat, as we focused on revenue management initiatives implemented last year.", "UPS Freight revenue climbed 23%, continuing the strong rebound that started last year. LTL shipments improved 10%, and weight per shipment was up 2%. ", "LTL revenue per hundredweight was up more than 8% and continues to be 1 of the best in the industry. Operating results improved on a year-over-year basis despite challenging weather conditions. ", "During the quarter, UPS announced the expansion of our express air freight services to customers in Israel and Slovakia. These developing countries are becoming important hubs for automotive, technology and other manufacturing industries. We also expanded our preferred less-than-container-load Ocean Freight service in Asia. More customers can now benefit from this unique expedited service that improves Ocean Freight delivery times to the U.S. by up to 40%.", "Now let's look at one of the hallmarks of UPS, our ability to generate cash. Free cash flow for the period was $900 million in spite of $1.2 billion in accelerated pension contributions made early in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $400 million. ", "With respect to distributions to share owners, we paid $500 million in dividends, reflecting a 10.6% increase per share announced during the quarter, continuing the UPS tradition of more than 4 decades of raising or maintaining our dividend. The company also spent $500 million to repurchase approximately 6.8 million shares.", "Regarding our outlook for the rest of 2011, the global economic outlook has become a little cloudier than it was 3 months ago. However, we still expect 2011 to be a great year with record earnings per share for UPS. In fact, our confidence has increased, and we are raising guidance for 2011 to a range of $4.15 to $4.40 per share, representing a 17% to 24% improvement over last year. ", "In the U.S. Domestic segment, we expect average daily volume to increase approximately 2% for the second quarter with continued strengthening in the second half of 2011. For the full year, Next Day Air and Ground are expected to grow at a similar pace.", "Yields will remain strong, as we continue to focus on the quality of revenue. And operating profit growth is expected to exceed 20% for the year, up from our previous guidance. ", "For the International segment, both revenue and operating profit are expected to grow approximately 10%. Full year operating margins are expected to be similar to 2010. Year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter will be especially difficult, as a result of headwinds created by our euro hedging programs, we estimate the impact to be approximately $40 million. Our Supply Chain and Freight segment is expected to produce mid to high single-digit revenue growth with continued margin expansion, driven primarily by UPS Freight.", "So in conclusion, UPS is off to a good start, performing well in the face of challenging conditions. We are executing our strategy of focusing on the quality of revenue, providing the best service and offering the most comprehensive set of solutions to our customers. ", "The UPS integrated global network is operating with incredible flexibility and efficiency. We are confident in our ability to meet customer needs and excited about the results that UPS share owners will see in the future. ", "Well, thanks for your attention. And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Mr. Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "I wanted to see, Kurt, if I could ask you to follow up a little bit on some of the volume commentary. I know you noted what you expected was a 2% impact for eastern weather. Even if I adjust that away, still don't seemingly have a lot of volume growth relative to what we're seeing, say, in industrial production and some of these other drivers. Is that the impact of these pricing initiatives? Is it de-marketing of some business that you know -- you just don't think is compensatory? What other color can you provide there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, we don't think there's a big impact of our yields focus. We have seen a little bit of a differential though in the growth, certainly, at the heavy freight end of the market from the small package. As we look at some of the statistics, industrial production is showing strength, but the majority of the strength in industrial production is coming from some of the heavier industry side, metals and some of those things that don't necessarily impact small package. So we do think that the Q1 was a little -- the economy was a little softer than we'd anticipated. I know some of the quarter-to-quarter numbers are now coming in at estimated 1.9%. But we see this really as a transitory, we think over time small package, the growth will ripple into there and that the freight is more of a leading indicator.", "D. Davis", "And Gary, during the recession, the IP numbers were down a lot more than the small package market volume was. So I think part of this recovery too is kind of distorted those correlations.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and then just as a quick follow-up to that, you guys have always talked about the leverage you have in the labor contract as it relates to volume. Do we need a lot of growth in order to recognize that? Are we reaching a stage where maybe attrition will allow you a little bit of leverage there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, I think we're seeing pretty good leverage right now, even with the headwinds we had and some of the most extraordinary weather in the first quarter. We did a great job of expanding domestic margins, and comp and benefit adjusted were up just slightly more than volume rates. So we think that the operating efficiency, the operational technology that's kicking in is showing substantial benefits. So I think we're seeing these benefits even without the tailwind of significant benefit of wage moderations. So still more to come as growth continues.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you, Scott, Kurt and Andy. Scott, are you guys seeing customers move up and down the supply chain with the volatility in oil prices?", "D. Davis", "I think not as much as we would have seen the last time through in 2008. I think one, we've adjusted our surcharge index where the difference between Air and Ground is not as dramatic as it was in the past. And then what you saw the first quarter actually was better performance in the premium products internationally and better performance on Next Day Package domestically, so we're not seeing it at this point in time.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Kurt Kuehn", "That's been a big priority for us following the spike in fuel in 2008 to revisit the structure of our fuel surcharges. And in general, the surcharges are lower because we have continued to move some of that rate into the core rates. And then, as Scott said, we've narrowed the gap so that we don't think the risk of trade down will be as great.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, great, thank you. And Kurt, as a follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that miles driven being down in the quarter. But as volumes pick up this year, do you anticipate this increasing? Or given the initiatives that you have in place, can you keep miles driven, say, flat?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, it really depends how great the growth is. I mean, we'd love to see an increase in miles driven by a robust economy and significant increases. We are confident that our miles will continue to grow at a much lower rate than our volume and growth and stops. The operational technology we put in to optimize and the focus on reducing fuel consumption is paying some real dividends.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thanks so much for your time this morning.", "Operator", "Our next person comes from the line of Mr. Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Thanks. Just back at the volumes domestically, did I hear you right, Kurt, the guidance was 2% for second quarter for domestic volumes and better than that in third and fourth? And if that's the case, and you're  down a little bit this quarter and a couple points for weather you're saying, were March and April better? Is that what's giving you the confidence to go from minus to positive 2%? And if so, kind of what were March and April?", "Kurt Kuehn", "March was not really better, Ed, because of the Easter lag. The buildup in the Easter comes several weeks before Easter. This year, with a late Easter, that's really moved over into April, and so we are seeing the typical seasonal buildup into April. So we don't see the core economic growth picking up dramatically, slightly better than for Q1. But the noise of the unprecedented weather, really, all 3 months, saw a significant weather headwinds, and the calendar impact and the little slower economy. As we factor through all those, we're pretty confident that the core growth rate coming into Q2 should be about 2%.", "D. Davis", "And April thoroughly is performing better than we saw in the first 3 months.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Can you give some number to that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think it's tough, Ed, right now because of the Good Friday and Easter Monday comparisons. Certainly, the first 2 weeks were quite strong last week compared against Good Friday, down a little bit. But we'll see a, certainly, a better April than we saw in the first 3 months.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and as a follow-up, with the domestic volume not there, you were still able to show the leverage and grow the domestic margin. Can you talk a little bit about what some of those levers are? Is it time and hiring people that's letting you leverage the underlying contract a little bit? Is it something else? Where are you seeing this leverage and what does 2% mean to that leverage relative to 0.6%?", "D. Davis", "The leverage is really coming from 2 components. Number 1 is the top line leverage, where as I said, one of our top priorities is making sure that we get pricing back to the levels that compensate us for the value we've created. And so the relatively firm stance on pricing and extracting the value that is there is a big driver of that. And at the same time, we are seeing the benefits of the deep investments we've made in operational technology. And we'll show a lot more of that at our Investor conference in September to give you guys a little more understanding of the multiple areas that we're  streamlining to network. So -- and all of that is without significant benefits of growth, which will help us both on scale densities and also the moderating the wage increases.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "I just wanted to follow up on Ed's question there a little bit in terms of talking about the yields and the price increases. Obviously, you're doing a great job there, and it's a big priority. But how easy is it to get the customer acceptance with fuel surcharges rising so rapidly? I know a little bit more of that's in the base, but how are you kind of thinking about that and what's the customer acceptance there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think so far, at least, the customer pushback has been minimal because certainly the levels are below some of the peaks that we saw. So, so far, not too much disruption on that front, but we have gone back in and worked with customers actively to see how we can realign their supply chains to minimize the impact of that. But so far, we haven't seen a significant impact of people really going back and revisiting their blend of premium and standard products.", "D. Davis", "The real concern for us is how long and how high energy prices go because that will probably impact the economy more. I think the rule of thumb for economists are that if oil prices go up $10 a barrel, it's going to knock down GDP about 0.02% in the year 1, about 0.5% in year 2. We've seen about $30 run in crude oil, so that could certainly have an impact in 2012, knock out about half the growth. So that's our concern, how high the prices go and how long.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Fair enough. And then, in terms of -- we talked a little bit about domestic maybe being just a little bit slower, how are you feeling on the International side in terms of the volume trends there and kind of going forward?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We were clearly thrilled by a continued very strong growth, 7% unit growth in our export volumes. Europe continues to outperform even with continued sluggish economy in Europe. So we feel very good that the International business is continuing to move forward. The comparisons to last year were a little tougher, as we said, because of some very beneficial hedging we had in 2010. But global trade continues to move along fairly strong, as Scott mentioned, in his prepared comments, not too much disruption yet on the Japan side, but UPS story continues to be great.", "D. Davis", "Yes, I think the global GDP numbers have maybe come down a tick from what we looked at 3 months ago. And that's pretty impressive when you consider what was now 3 months ago was the Japan situation, clearly, the problems in the Mideast and North Africa, the impact on energy prices, I think overall we've seen the global GDP drop from 3.7% to 3.5%, that's pretty encouraging really as we move forward. Europe actually has got a little bit better in that time frame, it's up 0.02%, the expectation for the rest of the year. So we feel it's a resilient economy, and we'll seek strong global trade throughout this year.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And I think one of the things we're doing is we are continuing to reinvest in that. With the announcement of the direct flight of Hong Kong into Europe. You connect those flights into our -- all points hub in Cologne, and we can have guaranteed service to 34 countries within Europe next day. So we're leveraging that deep integrated network we have in Europe and connecting that to Asia.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Great. Thanks for the time, and thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Malat of Goldman Sachs.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thanks. For domestic yields, can you just help us think about the positive impact of the dimensional weight changes, what you're seeing there? And then, anything you could tell us about weight changes, in general, will be helpful.", "Kurt Kuehn", "In general, weight is fairly stable, maybe up just a little bit, and that's typical with a recovery. It hasn't been perhaps as rapid as some other recoveries but neither has the absolute economic growth. The dim weight is just a part of our annual recalibration of the appropriate pricing, and it just more strongly focuses on those high cube packages that eat up a lot of space in our vehicles. So it is a contributor but certainly not material. I mean, the base rates, the fuel surcharge and some of the characteristics mixes are all a bigger impact in the dim weight in and of itself.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, that's helpful. Then just following up on a question from before, can you talk about what percentage of drivers are on the highest paid tier, remind us what kind of typical averages are? Just help us think through the mix right now of your drivers. And then, can you talk about the timing seasonality of turnover? Do you get more turnover in 2Q than the rest of the year?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. No, we remain at a very high percentage, over 90% of our drivers are at the full senior rate. And as we continue to streamline the network and reduce our direct hours, there's not as much mix of new employees in. So that's still a latent opportunity for us as we show stronger growth and the economy continues to expand. But we did not get any benefit from that in Q1.", "Mark McVicar - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "So over 90% and normalized levels are low 80s, 82%?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Something like that, yes. It differs based on the velocity of growth and the seniority of our employees.", "D. Davis", "This is as high as we can ever remember it.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next version will come from the line of Mr. Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Great. Just sticking on that same theme, Scott and Kurt. It looks like your comp costs were up 1% year-over-year, obviously, well below your revenue growth and obviously great move there and part of the margin gains. But can you talk about -- is that kind of the contribution toward the pension you've made? What is driving that spike increase?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, we did have a few cost headwinds into the year that we talked about in our guidance. So our pension expense was up substantially. We reinstated the employee match for the 401(k). At the same time, with -- we were able to limit our unit costs as it were across the whole company to less than 1%. So we feel very good about the trends in our comp and our productivity.", "D. Davis", "Yes, I think, Ken, it's just improved productivity. And we're continuing to invest in technology in that arena and will spend some time in the investor conference in September to walk through some of these, but there's more to be had there also.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So are we seeing actual employment numbers come down, aside from the driver numbers Scott was just talking about? Are we seeing -- is this increased productivity that gets rid of -- are you looking at employee numbers coming down on that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Up dramatically. I mean, with the -- it depends on the growth, certainly, if the U.S. economy stagnates, then there may be some reductions as we improve productivity. But with modest growth, we can basically offset the need to increase employees.", "D. Davis", "Ken, we're so flexible. That answer is different everyday based on package volume that we see coming in.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Great, and if I can get my follow-up on the Forwarding business. It looks like, again, you had, I guess, growth slowed there, down 3% from kind of mid-teens the last couple of quarters. Is there anything going on in the freight side, just trying to find something else because on the core side, you did such a great job on the margin gain.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. No, we've been -- we've -- actually, we're very pleased with our overall supply chain and freight performance with over 40% profit improvement. I did mention that in the Forwarding, we have been clearly going back and focusing on revenue management. Margins improved substantially. The other thing that's in that Forwarding and Logistics line is there is some headwind because we were overlapping the disposition of 2 businesses that were in that space. One, a small German Supply Chain business that we liquidated last year. And then late last year, we did sell our Logistics technology business, so there is a bit of a revenue headwind on that front that took the core Logistics growth down from solid mid-single-digits to just slightly increasing. So that distorts the numbers a little bit.", "D. Davis", "In air freight, in the first quarter last year, if you remember, it was extremely strong as there was still a capacity shortage out there. Rates were high and strong. This year, pretty slow February out of Asia, particularly with the Chinese New Year and people coming back to work late.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So your Domestic Package margin performance was very good in the quarter. I guess, if you look at it from an incremental margin perspective, it looks like about 43%, which is a pretty strong incremental margin performance. When you look at second quarter, do you think that, that can actually get better because first quarter, clearly, you didn't -- you had the weather and fuel lag impacts and volume is not quite as good. So I guess, if you can just offer thoughts of, can you do even better looking forward because it would seem that, that be kind of a natural conclusion, given the headwinds in first quarter? Thanks.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Tom, I guess I won't get into the details on incremental margins. There's a lot of moving parts there. Some is driven by total revenue, some is driven by yield and some by productivity. But we certainly feel that Q2 will be a better quarter than Q1. A, seasonally, it's usually stronger. And B, once again, we had some extraordinary headwinds in Q1. For those of you that live in New York know the kind of weather that we faced. Our small package operation because of the flexible network was able to adapt. We did see a little more headwind in the freight. But assuming that we don't get snow in May in Manhattan, we think we'll be in much better shape on the domestic side. And that's really the domestic outlook that was the driver of our guidance increase that we gave this quarter.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then in terms of a follow-up, you were asked earlier about just the broad approach on pricing. Do you think there is a significant difference in the sales force this year versus what you would have been this time last year in terms of how they're approaching the market, and that, that is playing some role in terms of realizing more price and a little less volume?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Tom, we are placing a slightly stronger focus on yield as opposed to just pure growth for its own sake. So it's possible at the increment that there's some reduction in volumes. Although we're not explicitly deciding to slow the growth down, so we feel pretty good that we're finding a good balance. As I said, Q1 was a very noisy quarter with calendar issues, with fuel, with the economy slowing and with weather. So I wouldn't read too much into the Q1 results. We think we'll get back on a reasonable growth trend, and that's encompassed in our guidance. But we did say over a year ago that 1 of our priorities is making sure that UPS gets compensated for the value that it creates. And we feel good that we're on track for that.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Great. Well, good, good quarter, and thanks for the time.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jon Langenfeld of Robert W. Baird.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "On the international side, can you talk about how pricing, general pricing trends in the trans-Pacific, transatlantic and intra-Europe?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, pricing has remained pretty positive, and you'll see that if you look at our currency adjusted results, John, that they've actually strengthened. So we do feel pretty good that it's a very stable environment. Certainly, there's no one consistent message for each market. Asia can be a little more volatile because of the big swings in capacity and growth, but we are very focused just as we are in the U.S. on making sure that we're pricing to value. And then for UPS, that unique value proposition is extremely strong, with us really being the only -- one of our major competitors that has a very strong balance position in Asia, in Europe and in the U.S., with the incredible capabilities we have within Europe, with our linkage of Asia to Europe next day, all of those things just continue to give our sales people a very strong value proposition. And on top of that, this ability to align our supply chain and trade capabilities with the small package solution makes it so that we really don't have to get aggressive on price to continue to grow reasonably.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay, good. And then same question, in the Domestic business, Kurt, you've talked about the small and midsized shipper being a hollow recovery and not seeing as much there. Can you comment on any recent trends there, and how that segment looks?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, John, that is one of the kind of the side stories in the domestic economy that we have seen that large global companies have bounced back more quickly. And certainly, that's the story in the U.S. where our big accounts and our accounts that have a global footprint have seen more growth. And that Main Street has been lagging some of these global companies. Liquidity hasn't been available, in that the recovery has, to some extent, been delayed in the middle market. So that trend has continued. We do see higher growth in our global companies than we do in our small and medium-sized ones. We think frankly, that could be a tailwind going forward as that part of the economy picks up more.", "D. Davis", "John, I think I'm optimistic you'll see a pickup later this year in that group. I think clearly the credit availability has improved dramatically from where it was 12 months ago, for the SMEs. That will help an awful lot. We're also working hard to get some of these free trade agreements done to help get the SMEs into the exporting part of the business because that's where the future is for them. And you heard many times, 95% of the consumers are outside of the U.S. We have to get small and medium-sized enterprises to export.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kaufman of Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Thank you very much. 2 questions, you spoke a little bit about the heavy versus light and the small shipper versus global shipper notice you had seen. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more geographic color. We've been hearing a theme across a lot of companies that kind of the, the middle of the country and the farm belt was a relatively stronger economy than on the coast, could you give us a view either geographically or industry-wide of where you're seeing some changes?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Jeff, there's not huge differences. Although I think your pickup on the Midwest, certainly, with some of the manufacturing rebound and some of the commodity and early products and supply chain booming that we are seeing some firmness there. Although, clearly, the automotive group has recovered substantially versus where it was at a year ago. So I think on a year-over-year basis, we're seeing some pockets of strength centered around some of those specific industries.", "D. Davis", "From a sector perspective, Jeff, and for us, it seems like we still saw in the first quarter the major growth in the retail, on the technology side. As Kurt said, we are seeing sequential strengthening in the manufacturing of wholesale durables as we've moved through the quarter. So it's looking a little bit better as we move forward.", "Jeffrey Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Okay, thank you. And the follow-up, you made a comment on the freight forwarding side that I thought was interesting is that you were able basically to purchase your capacity at better rates, which would seem to fly in the face of we've got great strength in the international markets. Is it more on the Ocean side, is it more on the custom side, or is it just that you are able to fully pass on price increases to customers?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, it's more on the Air side. And we think one of the real opportunities, Jeff, for us is to take advantage of this very unique business model we have where we are both an airline and a very large freight forwarder. And 1 of our top priorities over the last 6 to 9 months has been really perfecting our buy rate capabilities and knowing when to use our network and when to buy capacity. So with the softness in Asia, especially because of the Chinese New Year, there were some opportunities to do some spot buys at attractive rates. So if you're opportunistic and you've got comprehensive systems and you can look at alternative ways to get goods to move, there's some real opportunities to get good margins.", "Jeffrey Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I just had a couple of quick data questions. The first was, Kurt, could you just talk a little bit about the size of your B2C business now and the growth rate in the first quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, B2C remains, Bill, a little bit over 1/3 of our volume. And it certainly was stronger in the first quarter.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Stronger than B2B?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Stronger than B2B, yes. The B2C growth continues to be stronger, certainly, especially at the lighter end of the market where there is a lot of focus.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, the follow-up question here is just on the buybacks, I guess, given how good the first quarter cash flows were and how well you actually did in 2009, I realize there's uncertainty in the world, but I would think that your buyback could be a lot more aggressive. And I'm just kind of curious what holds you back.", "D. Davis", "Well, we guided to a fairly substantial increase, up $2 billion for the year. We increased the dividend almost 11%. Having said that, Bill, I think you're correct that the cash flow outlook is strong even with all of those distributions. Our forecasts are for an increase in cash balance, and we'll continue to look at that. But right now, we're executing around what we guided, and we did purchase about 25% of the annual amount. We do some of it. We're doing systematically and some opportunistically, and we'll continue that way. So...", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. No, but you're raised your earning guidance, so I thought maybe you'd raise this as well.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, we'll see. We'll see.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson Davis.", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis & Co", "It's Thompson Davis & Company, and thank you very much. I heard your kind of favorable comments about Forwarding and the Supply Chain Solutions divisional profits, but assuming that the Freight division sort of broke even versus a loss a year ago, there wasn't a lot of growth in earnings in the Supply Chain business. What happened there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, I don't think that's true. No. We saw significant improvements in both fronts. Our Forwarding group increased, and we did see good improvements in our Freight. David, you're correct. The UPS Freight segment, overall, was approximately breakeven, did had a real great March, which had a little better weather, but the flexibly of the LTL isn't as much as package. So we did see some headwinds in January and February. But overall, the segment's up 44%, and our Forwarding unit did see substantial improvements in margins versus last year.", "D. Davis", "The LTL margins didn't lose $40 million last year's first quarter. It's much less than that.", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis & Co", "Okay. So you're optimistic about that forwarding operations in the second quarter?", "D. Davis", "Yes, we are. We think we've got the global network put together. We're continuing to enhance our forwarding capabilities. We're expanding cold chain capabilities as we target the healthcare market, and there's clearly a lot of opportunity for high-quality forwarding with temperature control capabilities. So there's a lot of ways we think we can continue to differentiate our forwarding capabilities across the globe.", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis & Co", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David Ross", "First question is on the other operating expenses. Outside of fuel, which we know why that was up more than rest of -- repairs and maintenance was up significantly more than the others, is there any weather impact in the repairs and maintenance line, or is that because the fleet is getting a little bit older, you kind of due for some normal maintenance checks?", "D. Davis", "I think it is not atypical for us to see repair and maintenance jump in a quarter or 2, and this has primarily driven the, I think, engines and airplanes with maintenance there. Now that will vary by quarter based on timing of C checks and those type of things. So nothing out of line there.", "David Ross", "Okay. And then, if you look at the UPS Freight segments with yields up high single digits, can you give us a little bit of a breakdown in terms of how much of that was maybe fuel surcharge, how much is mix-related, and how much pure pricing is going up right now in the LTL market for you guys?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. Fuel was a little more than half of the 8.5% revenue per hundredweight. So we still had very good solid base rate improvements. And so we think we're striking a real good balance of steady, prudent growth, and also very firm yields. So we're pleased with the progress we're making. We continue to show great results in broadening our market share, especially in the middle market. And aligning our capabilities, so customers can move back and forth between freight and small package.", "David Ross", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Matt Brooklier of Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Thanks. We heard your comments regarding weather's impact on volume, 2 percentage points at domestic packages. Is there any way to quantify the incremental cost you guys saw during the quarter from weather?", "D. Davis", "That was the weather and the timing of Easter.", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, we really haven't broken out the cost. It was -- although, certainly, there was some, as I said, probably the net operational impact was greater in freight than in package. Our package network is highly flexible, but we did see demand impact. And our sense is that we'll ripple through into Q1 GDP estimates or that, that will be coming out shortly. So it was a headwind for cost, but it was a balanced mix of both the revenue reduction and some additional increase in expense.", "Matthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay. When we got your guide for '11 at Supply Chain and Freight, all in, with respect to the revenue growth, any chance you want to provide some color on the out margins at that division in '11?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, we do think it will continue to show moderate improvements in margins. And we feel pretty good about the progress on that. Clearly, we're not going to show 44% improvements every quarter. The comps to last year were a little easier. Frankly, this quarter, they'll be a little tougher in the second quarter. But we think, in general, we're going to see good solid upper single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion.", "D. Davis", "And KL is normally stronger in Q2 and Q3, which will help us.", "Matthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Right. Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, thanks. You guys have commented a couple of times on trends in Asia. I just wonder if you could develop or build on that a little bit. Just kind of what you have seen, particularly in March and April, as we came out of the Chinese New Year holiday and if we've seen strengthening in that region.", "D. Davis", "I think we are seeing strengthening. And I think, January and February started off a little bit slow due to the factory closure in China. But I think, March has strengthened, April is staying strong. The unknown right now obviously is the impact to supply chain from Japan. Right now, it's not had a big impact to our volume and revenue numbers. But as we go forward, that could be a bigger impact, overall, for the economy. I heard a lot of things yesterday, I think Johnson Controls mentioned that big reduction in parts and imports for them from Japan going forward. So I think, clearly, you're going to see an impact on the automotive sector. The technology is unknown at this point in time. It's really hard to see. There's lots of rumors of parts shortages. At UPS, we're big a procurer of technology. We have not seen shortages at this point in time. So it could have an impact, but overall, we're seeing a pretty good strength out of Asia and global trade should stay strong.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And just on the back of that, when you think about your guidance for the full year, marrying in the price of fuel and what we're seeing out of Asia, I'm guessing, could you just give a little bit of color of what your -- underlying assumptions there, particularly as it relates to fuel? And then what we're seeing, I guess, as Japan, have you included anything in your forecast as you look forward, I know you mentioned domestic is a bit of the driver for the increase going forward?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, we really have not factored in an explicit Japan impact. We've looked at that and you can come up with numerous positives and negatives. I mean, we have seen some customers reaching out to us to help them relocate their distribution capabilities. So depending on how it ripples through the supply chain, there may be movement from Ocean to Air. Certainly, there's going to be some demand disruption. So with the Japan factor, we've really not explicitly quantified. We have estimated fuel to be somewhere $105, maybe a little more than that for the year. So there's maybe a little exposure there. But remember, that the big issue for us on fuel is rapid change. So when it moves rapidly, as it has this year, we do suffer a 2-month lag. And certainly April has a headwind because we're overlapping February, and then early March's increase. But if that's stabilizes, even at its current level, then there shouldn't be too much downside risk.", "D. Davis", "And we have factored in, as our GDP baseline we've knocked it down a couple tenths of a point, primarily due to fuel. As we said before, the fuel's running about $105, $110 a barrel, we'll probably have a couple tenths impact in the overall global and U.S. GDP this year.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great. That's helpful, guys. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rob Byde of HSBC.", "Robin Byde - HSBC", "Just a question on the expansion of your Asia Europe Air bridge. Can you say a bit more about the reasons for expanding at this time? For example, has there been a particular shifting capacity put on by T&T, DHL or another competitor? And then, just to sort of follow-up, can you give us a bit more color on the mix between heavier freight and parcel? So is this additional activity more freight forwarding than parcels?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Robin, let me start with the second half of your question first. The separation in our reporting is pretty clean, that our international export growth is definitely package growth. So that 7-and-plus percent that we showed was legitimate small and medium-sized packages. The freight really shows up elsewhere. So that, even though we do see in the U.S. a fairly significant difference between the freight growth and the small package, the spread is not as great internationally, although that's probably a company-specific story. We did decide to add those direct flights from Hong Kong and really exercise our structural advantage after seeing a number of competitors did frankly. And we do have the capability of linking Asia to Europe in a way that no one else does. And so it did seem that it was an appropriate way. We put up our 747 direct flight, and it's operating very well, and we are seeing good demand for that. So it's both matching some competitive challenges, but also raising the bar, and that we're comfortable to do that when the returns are there.", "Robin Byde - HSBC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. Scott Flower of Macquarie Securities.", "Scott Flower - Macquarie Research", "Scott and Kurt, couple of questions. 1 is, and I sense obviously the competitive environment is fairly benign. And you have a lot of noise in the volume numbers in first quarter, but are you at all worried that maybe there's some share loss seeping in on the Ground side because obviously that number is a bit weaker than I would have expected, understanding there is weather and some noise there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Scott, I wouldn't characterize the market is benign. The market's extremely competitive. Customers have multiple choices, and so we're out there competing like crazy. The comparisons to our competitors are a little confusing because some of them are use a different calendar. FedEx, for example had the December in their last quarter, which makes comparisons a little unusual. And we haven't heard yet from the post office, which is another very large player. We suspect they'll show negative results. So we do think the economy was a little softer. We're certainly watching carefully, and we think over the longer term, it's been clear that we've been able to maintain share, and our expectation is we'll continue to.", "Scott Flower - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then the other question is, and I know obviously, from a soft first quarter, things should improve, but I'm just wondering, with some of the potential depressing effects of oil and obviously,  you could already bet, 1-year impact or 2-year impacts, that comes in a lag basis and government cut backs and some of the impacts maybe of the euro on exports. Why you feel other than sort of a pickup from 1Q, that there might not be some softness as we go a little bit later, with some of those impacts that may lag a bit?", "D. Davis", "Scott, you're right. There are a lot of clouds out there in Japan and gasoline prices near $4, and tightening in China, but there's a lot of positives out there also. I think if you look back at Fed funds they're still near 0, very accommodative. Credit conditions, as I mentioned earlier, are improving for small and medium-sized businesses. Emerging markets are likely to continue to drive growth. I think profits are strong, corporate balance sheets are strong, and you're seeing great numbers, good IP numbers and good retail numbers. So there are some risks out there, but I think there's an awful lot of strengths also.", "Scott Flower - Macquarie Research", "Will the euro strengthening at all hurt your European export business?", "D. Davis", "It certainly hasn't to date. We just show strong growth there and then obviously ought to get better U.S. exports with the weak dollar.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And actually the strongest area we're accessing is Europe to Asia where the comparisons aren't as difficult. Scott, maybe just to put an edge on this, we did increase our guidance for the year. It's not based on an estimate of increased demand across the globe. What it really is based on is our increased confidence in the UPS business model to adapt to conditions and to continue to generate good economic results. So it's more an affirmation that we feel the company is operating well than that the global economy has got a lot of upside. We're not gloomy on where the world's heading, but we're also cautious, but we're confident we can adapt to conditions as they occur.", "Scott Flower - Macquarie Research", "Great. Well, thank you, all.", "D. Davis", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "That does conclude our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dolny for any closing remarks.", "Andy Dolny", "Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Scott for some final comments.", "D. Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Well, this past quarter presented significant challenges for many companies across the globe. It reminds me of something, our founder, Jim Casey said, way back in 1947, he said, \"Determined people make conditions. They do not allow themselves to be victims of them.\" His observation of over 60 years ago, still rings true today. UPS is not to write the quarter off when faced with challenging conditions. We rose to the occasion and demonstrated the resilience and flexibility of UPS. And it's evidenced in results that we announced today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, UPS Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Andy Dolny. The floor is yours, sir.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and our expectations going forward. Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language.", "Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2010 Form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports.

", "Now to begin our review, I'll turn the program over to Scott.", "D. Davis", "Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Today, UPS reported another quarter of impressive results, however, it was not without some difficulty, given the uneven nature of the global economy. While fuel prices have come down some and Japan appears to be recovering, high unemployment and weak consumer confidence continue. The end of the second round of quantitative easing and the government debt issues only add to the uncertainty. 2011 has been a difficult year to forecast economic growth. For example, according to the Wall Street Journal, back in February, in the middle of the quarter, 51 leading economies expected first quarter U.S. GDP to grow 3.6%. And as you know, it ended up at only 1.9%. ", "The current forecast call for second half GDP growth of more than 3%. Given all the uncertainty that exists in the U.S. economy, it could end up being anywhere from 1.5% to 3.5%. Bottom line, economic growth expectations have slowed from where they were at the start of 2011. And as I said last quarter, the increasing U.S. exports is a key component in creating jobs here at home and helping our economy grow. I'm hopeful the Congress will act soon on the pending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But clearly, they are not acting fast enough. I can assure you that UPS is not sitting back waiting for the economy or trade agreements to keep us growing. We are creating our own opportunities to ensure that UPS keeps moving in the right direction. For example, in June, UPS held the Sixth Annual Healthcare Forum. More than 85 senior-level healthcare executives from 60 companies attended the Washington, D.C. event to discuss key supply chain issues and opportunities. Events like these give us insight into the challenges and opportunities in the industry. We continue to invest in expansion of our healthcare capabilities.", "Last month, UPS made a significant announcement in this space, the global broadening of a relationship with Merck. We have been working closely, developing a deep understanding of their needs and have a strong network in place to support them. The relationship with Merck will expand to include Europe, Asia and Latin America. UPS will provide a broad range of services, including distribution, warehousing and transportation. UPS's industry-leading technology, unmatched breadth of solutions and strong global presence were some of the many factors that allowed us to win this business. ", "A year ago, we strengthened our presence in Asia by opening our Shenzhen facility. Since this have opened, we have significantly improved Time-In-Transit for more than 100 intra-Asia lanes, enhancing service levels for UPS customers and key business centers like Beijing, New Delhi, Mumbai and Seoul. We just announced another recent development in Asia, the expansion of the UPS Air network to serve the important Western China City of Chengdu. This new flight provides express services to Europe and the Americas from this rapidly emerging center of technology and manufacturing.", "Not only did UPS expand its global network, we added to our unmatched portfolio of solutions. We introduced UPS Returns Exchange, another tool in the reverse Logistics portfolio to support the needs of our customers. They're excited about how this product will improve visibility and inventory management and enhance the post-sales experience for their customers.", "Overall, it was a good quarter for UPS. In fact, it was our highest second quarter EPS ever. Despite slowing economic growth expectations, I'm encouraged by the progress we are making. Our strategy is sound, and hard work of UPS's around the globe is paying off. ", "Now let me turn it over to Kurt.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Another solid quarter for UPS, with earnings up 25% on revenue growth of more than 8%. We had over 30% improvement in U.S. Domestic profit, strong International export volume growth and the best quarterly profit ever in Supply Chain and Freight. ", "In fact, the $1.05 earnings per share set a new high for UPS in the second quarter. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 12.6% despite higher fuel costs and an increasingly challenging global economic environment. UPS growth strategies, combined with our focus on quality of revenue, as well as network efficiencies produced these results.", "Now let's take a look at how the segments performed for the quarter. U.S. Domestic operating profit climbed 31% on revenue growth of more than 6%. Domestic volumes were flat as a result of the slow U.S. economy and our continued focus on revenue management. Operating margin expanded by 240 basis points to 12.7%, demonstrating the leverage inherent in our integrated network. ", "Revenue per piece climbed more than 6%, due primarily to stronger base rates and higher fuel surcharges. In fact, stronger base rates contributed roughly half the improvement. Technology solutions continue to improve our network efficiency, delivering big operational savings as demonstrated by reductions in both direct labor hours and miles driven.", "These savings partially offset cost increases associated with wage inflation, pension and the 401(k) match. The lag in the fuel surcharge had a minimal impact on profitability as energy prices did moderate during the quarter. As high energy costs continue to prevail, we are vigilant in the pursuit to reduce usage. And UPS continues to evaluate a wide array of solutions, including various operational technologies, alternative fuels and new vehicle designs. One example is our new prototype composite package car. The weight of this vehicle is 1,000 pounds lighter than a traditional vehicle, and it's 40% more efficient. We are testing 5 of these vehicles to determine if they can stand up to our demanding needs, and we'll have one of the vehicles on display at our Investor Conference in Louisville on September 14.", "Now let's turn to the International segment. Revenue was up more than 13% on strong volume growth of 6.2%. Export volumes increased over 8% with growth around the world. Europe and China continued their momentum of solid growth, although we did see slowing in the rest of Asia. Non-U.S. Domestic volumes improved 5%, led by double-digit growth in France and Turkey, along with solid increases in Canada, Germany and Mexico. International package deals were up 4% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by higher fuel surcharges and base rates. Our International operating margin of 15.8% was up 40 basis points compared to the first quarter and remains industry-leading. Operating profit was $497 million. This is down $24 million from last year. Currency translation and hedging programs had a negative impact to operating profit of more than $50 million, and fuel was also a slight drag for the quarter. ", "Remember when comparing to last year, the second quarter of 2010 presents a very challenging comparison. For example, International operating profits were up about 80% over 2009, driven in part by a 40% growth rate in UPS Asian exports. We continue to invest for growth and have significantly increased air network capacity in Asia since the beginning of 2010. While this additional lift does create a temporary drag in operating margin, it positions us very well for future growth.", "In addition to the new Chengdu flight that Scott mentioned earlier, during the quarter, UPS made other moves to improve service and increase capacity on our global air network. In Latin America, UPS upsized 19 weekly flights, effectively increasing our payload capacity in key markets by more than 50%.", "Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment. Revenue was up 7% to $2.3 billion, led by UPS Freight's 19% gain. Operating profits increased more than 40% to $187 million, while margin expanded 200 basis points to 8.1%, both our new highs for this developing segment. Clearly, the long-term investments we've been making over the years are paying off. The increase in operating profit was driven primarily by the Forwarding business, with UPS Freight also contributing. ", "Forwarding revenue growth was muted by tonnage decreases, although operating profit improved significantly due to revenue management initiatives and market conditions. Capacity increases outpaced demand, pushing our buy rates lower. UPS Freight's jump in revenue was driven by strong LTL tonnage and shipment growth. Revenue per hundredweight was up 11%, driven by both higher fuel surcharges and increased base pricing.", "As expected, UPS Freight improved profitability this quarter. Our strategy of focusing on the middle market, leveraging the Small Package sales force and driving operational efficiencies are paying off and continue to move us in the right direction. The Distribution business continued to see solid growth in the Healthcare sector. Operating profit growth was relatively flat due to our substantial investments as we expand our global capabilities in this strategic vertical. UPS recently opened 3 dedicated distribution facilities in Canada, Brazil and Singapore, bringing the total healthcare compliance space to more than 4 million square feet across 30 facilities around the world.", "Now let's talk about cash flow. UPS continues to excel in this financial metric. For the 6 months ending June 30, free cash flow was more than $2.3 billion, even after making accelerated pension contributions of $1.2 billion. We continue to reinvest in the business with first half capital expenditures approaching $1 billion. UPS has taken delivery on 6 additional aircrafts. The capacity created by the four 767s and two 747-400s allows UPS to further expand the reach of its networks to markets across the world.", "With respect to distributions to shareowners for the 6 months ended June, UPS paid dividends of more than $1 billion, a 10.6% increase per share. In addition, we repurchased 14.4 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion, more than doubled last year's level. ", "Regarding our outlook for the remainder of 2011. We are reaffirming our earnings per share guidance of $4.15 to $4.40 a share. Regarding the U.S. Domestic segment, UPS will continue to benefit from its focus on yield and on improvements in operational efficiency. Keep in mind, however, starting in the third quarter, we begin to lap the benefits of the U.S. restructuring. That being said, the shape of the next 2 quarters may not reflect typical seasonality.", "Given the softness in the U.S. economy, we expect third quarter volume growth to be slow and operating margins to be similar to last year. In the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year operating margin expansion. In International, we expect second half operating profit growth of mid-to upper teens, compared to last year as the impact of our hedging programs is mostly behind us. The Supply Chain and Freight segment will continue to see the margin expansion and revenue growth, as we expect to experience operating profit growth in Freight and strong operating margins in Forwarding.", "To wrap this up, as Scott indicated, economic conditions have slowed since we last provided guidance. A good example, U.S. GDP growth expectation for 2011 was at 3.1%. It was revised downward to 2.9% and now sits at 2.5%. These trends may reverse the summer projecting or they may continue. Clearly, economic conditions in the second half will impact where we fall within our range. That being said, our guidance for full year EPS growth of 17% to 24% remains unchanged, and 2011 will be a record year for UPS. ", "Thanks for your attention, and now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Let's look at International, as you expand your International network and you build out your International network, are there start-up costs that are still incurring which could impact margins?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, certainly, the addition of capacity does create some time period to get utilization back up to where it is. And it's just not visible utilization, it's really the revenue maximization. So especially in Asia, we've had fairly significant capacity expansions. You've heard about us continue to improve service through there. And for the first few quarters, anyway, of a new flight, typically, there's a higher portion of cargo and freight on the plane, so the revenue yield is not quite as rich. So it's a little bit of a headwind right now, but in general, we feel pretty good, and we expect International to show solid double-digit growth for the rest of the year.", "D. Davis", "And clearly, Kevin, I think going to areas like Chengdu, we're going there because our customers are asking us to go there. We're going to see a tremendous growth in Western China over the next 5 years, and we think we're positioned very well to serve that market going forward.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Kind of a follow-up, and talking about adding to your Asia air network, are you shifting capacity around? Or is this new capacity you're introducing to your airline fleet?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It's primarily new capacity, as we are either upscaling aircraft, making additional stops or new aircraft, so we're doing it prudently. We want to make sure we don't get ahead of the market, but as we bring some of these new efficient large aircraft in, it does make sense to put them on the international flights.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Scott, you gave a pretty wide range for GDP of 1.5% to 3.5% for the second half of the year. Should we interpret that to mean that you can meet your guidance range even if it's only 1.5% GDP? And then, does that suggest kind of material upside to your guidance that second half is closer to 3.5% growth?", "D. Davis", "Well, I think we have not narrowed our range, Scott, for the year, primarily because of the uncertainty in the economy. So I think I'm comfortable saying that we will be within the range at 1.5% economy or 3.5% economy. Clearly, where we are in the range will depend on how strong the economy turns out. As you know, we have some positives out there with the energy price decline and Japan supply chain getting back on. But obviously, with the debt ceiling hanging out there, the uncertainty that causes, big issues, I think last night's national media didn't give anybody more confidence that this will get resolved. I think we expected it to be the last minute before it get resolved and will get resolved but a lot of uncertainty. Consumer confidence is down because of it. Unemployment is still weak, so a lot of uncertainties right now, but we feel comfortable with the range we gave.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Okay, that's helpful, and just a follow-up. Just trying to understand why Domestic Package volumes are still soft. I mean, we're certainly seeing better than flattish GDP and IP growth. I'm just wondering, do you think you're losing share because of the pricing strategy, maybe a small package overall losing share because of high fuel and consolidating into larger shipments. Just any color there would be great, and any expectations you have specifically for volumes going forward?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, sure, I'll talk to that a little bit, but I think over the -- maybe talking about the market in general, first off, that in any given point in time in an economic cycle, Small Package may outperform or underperform. Typically, in a recovery phase, it may lag IP and some of those things, but if you take a look over the last 7 or 8 years or so, really watching the full length of the cycle we've been through, Small Package growth has outperformed both GDP and IP. Granted, the numbers haven't been exciting, given where the U.S. economy has ended up over that time period. So I think as you smooth out over the cycle, we still feel pretty confident that the Small Package industry will continue to be a good place to be. As we look at the overall industry, we think the overall Small Package environment has been relatively flat the last couple of quarters, if you look at all the players. It's multiplayer market and clearly, the post office continues to show some declines. So we feel that we're holding on to share right now, frankly. And that we are focusing on getting good strong yields across our entire portfolio that does require a level of discipline and patience in some cases, and we're pleased with the results we're seeing. Clearly, the yields continue to be strong, and we feel confident that trend is going to continue.", "D. Davis", "And I think some of the fastest growing markets is International Package market, and we've continually, over the last 10 years, grown faster than the market.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Any volume expectations going forward?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, we just commented that we expect Q3 to continue to be fairly slow, frankly, unless there's a big catalyst. But we do expect to see a little stronger growth then moving into Q4.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jon Langenfeld of Baird.", "Benjamin Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "This is Ben Hartford in for Jon this morning. If I could start on the International side and get your sense on what some of the pressure on the margins were this quarter. It looks like, based on your expectation from mid- to upper teen EBIT growth in the back half of the year, that the pressure start to normalize, but can you talk a little bit about the pricing dynamic on the International lanes?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, well, we feel pretty good overall on the pricing. We warned you last quarter that there was going to be some real headwinds for our International business. The currency, in light of the hedging we did this year versus last year, the euro plummeted last year, and we did protect ourselves back then and sold away some of the upside. So currency, overall, was about a $50 million headwind for us. And fuel also was a headwind in International although it was fairly neutral for Domestic. If you add those 2 back in, you actually get a pretty darn good result with margins approaching 18%, so I think those are 2 onetime events that did impact Q2, and I think we've been trying to warn you guys that, that was coming. Clearly, the fuel was an addition on top of that. So that was the short-term issue that really created the decline in profits even with great growth and firm yields. Looking to the second half of the year, we do expect to see a double-digit profit growth again. Overall, the macro environment internationally is moderating slightly. We did mention that Asia has cooled, although China continues strong. So there are some, I guess, bit of mitigating factors a little bit, although, clearly, with us showing 8% export growth, we're still gaining share, as Scott said, and creating good results. So we see this as a solid period for International, but the market, we think, is maybe catching its breath a little bit, and we'll see what the next leg is.", "D. Davis", "Yes, Ben, I'd say that the first half of the year International performed about exactly what we thought it would, probably the only surprise was maybe Asia being a little bit slower than we've expected, Europe being a little bit stronger than we've expected and Germany continues to just outperform. Germany's GDP expectations have climbed dramatically from what we saw at the start of the year, so Europe is staying strong, and overall, we're confident with the second half of the year.", "Benjamin Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay, great. And on the Supply Chain and Freight side, but just specifically looking at Supply Chain, very strong performance here, particularly on the Forwarding segment. It looks like if you exclude Freight that EBIT margins in that segment on the Supply Chain are approaching best-in-class levels. So I'm wondering if, one, you would agree with that statement, and two, is this type of margin performance sustainable? And where should we think about margins in that segment going forward from here?", "Kurt Kuehn", "A lot of pieces of the puzzle there you asked me. But we are -- we're very pleased with the progress we've made in Supply Chain. It's a great example of kind of our long-term perspective of investing for a decade, refining the business model and building a global footprint. And with us aligning it into all of our other capabilities in technology, we feel very good that we've built something that will last and will create shareowner value. We do think we're  approaching best-in-class margins. The Forwarding group is clicking very well. We did mention that actually distribution is investing deeply right now. As we had these major healthcare facilities around the world, that's clearly an investment. But even with that there, they're holding in there well. The Forwarding margins do cycle. In periods of weak buy rates, the forwarder does well and the airline makes a little less money. So you've seen that balance this quarter, where as some of the rates have come down, we're not making quite as much on our airline capacity, but we're doing great as a forwarder. So margins will fluctuate, but having that balance of capabilities is great. And there's still a lot of headroom on the UPS Freight side. We've remain very disciplined. We're showing both growth and very strong yields, and so I think that story is still there to be written, and we look for good things for that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I wanted to ask you, I guess, a thought on Domestic Package margin. The first 2 quarters of the year, you've shown this nice formula of pretty significant Domestic Package margin improvement despite volumes which were flattish essentially, I guess, maybe down slightly in first quarter. And then in third quarter, I recognize you lapped some of the U.S. restructuring, so that is a difference in the comparison in the cost side. But is the formula still in place that you have nice margin expansion on pricing and cost? Or is your comment on third quarter domestic margin being flat, is the formula changing a bit, again, in terms of you're doing well despite flat volumes?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, Tom, I do think it is -- we do want to be pretty clear on what we see going on in the Domestic. We do expect in Q3 anyway for margin cost to be fairly flat to last year. A lot of that's driven by our expectation of a continued extremely sluggish U.S. environment. So that's the primary driver on that front. But also, as we look at our comps year-over-year, Q3 of 2010 was an exceptional quarter for us. We did have good strong recovery growth, and there were some -- the third quarter is usually the quarter in which we do some of our true-ups for workers comp and some of the health trends. So that was an area where we benefited last year. We don't expect to see quite as much benefit this year. So a little bit of a breather in Q3, but the operational efficiencies and the yield management and the focus on growing profits remains, and we think you'll see that back more clearly on a year-over-year basis in Q4. So a little bit of tougher comps, certainly ramping the restructuring which has been incredibly successful for us, it has added at least $0.10 a share, so some of that tailwind mitigates as we lap that. But we still think the other 2 trends are strong and will continue to show good results, especially starting on the Q4 again on a comp basis.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So how much of that third quarter difficult comparison and flat Domestic margin is -- you mentioned accrual, how much of that story is kind of onetime and you'd say, well, you hit that in third quarter, and how much of it is well if you have flat volumes than the margin kind of trends towards flat even though you're getting pricing?", "D. Davis", "Certainly, the economic cycle is the biggest driver. I mean, the onetime events of workers comps and summer time of that which happen in Q3 typically is not a huge issue, that's just one of the mitigating factors. But we're continuing to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Clearly, if there's no volume and growth in the industry for an extended period, it will slow the rate of profit growth. But we anticipate that we'll show increases in both margin and profit in Q4, given most scenarios that we've looked at.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay, and that's because your volumes get better in Q4, or what's -- I guess, I still don't see what the difference is in the 3Q and 4Q views?", "D. Davis", "It's a combination both of some, certainly, some expectation of firming and also the comparisons become more normal.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Dave Vernon of Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Just a quick question on the strength that you're seeing in the LTL volume relative to weakness in Package. This is sort of a follow-up to an earlier question, but do you see that maybe some of the volume is being pushed back towards LTL in the ground?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, it is a fluid process. And we frankly try to make that as easy as possible. We carbonized our shipping systems so customers on a daily basis can shift between LTL and package. And clearly, in the last couple quarters, the LTL industry has shown much greater growth than the package industry. So there may be some slight shifting on the increment. We have seen actually though, even though LTL held up fairly strong in the second quarter, we have seen things begin to moderate a little bit in July. So we're positive on the LTL as an industry, but clearly, there's some risk I think also to growth there.", "D. Davis", "David, if you look at previous cycles, I think you do see where the LTL seems to come back a little bit quicker than Small Package. And clearly, during the recession, we saw the Small Package market dropped quite a bit, not as far as IP, but it always seems to lag coming back, so it's not unusual occurrence.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay, and then maybe just a follow-up on the LTL space. With respect to the fact that you're getting better rates, where do you guys stand relative to the industry in terms of driver pay? Would you say you guys are sort of average, above average? I'm just trying to understand maybe how much of that rate increase you're going to be actually able to retain versus what's going to flow through towards driver pay increases?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We've got a very reasonable contract in place that will show modest below inflation increases in wages. So that's an ongoing process. We do have a contract, and so we're not quite as volatile as perhaps the market rates, which I know are getting squeezed right now. So we feel good that we've got a good outlook for the cost structure. Clearly, the Freight business continues to get more effective and streamlined, and we did accelerate the way the rate increase into August, which will also be beneficial on the yield side. So we feel like the formula was good. We've got a very high-quality service, superior technology and the customers that are using a blend of package and freight to match shipment characteristics are the ones that are seeing tremendous savings. So it's a win-win for us, if we can keep it in the network and help customer choose on a daily or weekly basis.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "If I could just start off with kind of a follow-up on the International, the currency exchange. Kurt, was that -- the $50 million, was that all due to the currency exchange? Or can you kind of dig into that, that $50 million and then looking forward, what should we expect on the impacts into the second half, the third and fourth on the International side?", "Kurt Kuehn", "The $50 million is a combination of the direct currency impact and hedging losses, frankly. Back last year, when the euro was in the mid-$1.20s, we put some collars in place that protect us on the downside and cap the upside. That creates a hedging loss, Ken. That was the primary impact for us in the second quarter, and those hedging losses will mitigate dramatically in the third and fourth quarters. So that was the biggest specific impact on us.", "D. Davis", "In fact, Ken, what will happen in 2012 will actually benefit from currency hedging because the price we paid this year is going to help our comparisons next year. So going forward, probably the next 6 quarters or so, our currency should not be a drag and probably will be a little bit of a help.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So including into the back half, you won't see any residual impact?", "D. Davis", "Right.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then, as you look to the slowing economy, you made some comments on that earlier on. Looking at Next Day Air volumes being down, you talked about adding planes domestically. What signs do you look for to either slow the ads or postpone or go back to parking? How dramatic does that step have to be where you then go into that cost-cutting mode again?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, I think, on the Domestic side, really block hours are almost flat, so we've not been adding anything significant in the U.S. Occasionally, if a lane gets heavy, we'll upscale a plane, and we've got a very highly compatible fleet, so it's very easy to move from like a 75 to a 76. So it's always a balancing act of throwing the ball a little bit ahead of the runner. So you catch the demand when it's there but not getting ahead of yourself, and we've been pretty pleased with our ability to keep high utilization. Being a freight forwarder also helps to fill it up in the Domestic market, specifically. Clearly, the North American Airfreight, we did have a competitor decide to exit that market, so that should be good for demand and for yields, we think, in the Domestic Airfreight. So we watch all of those things very frequently, and we get a lot of insights because we sit in virtually all the markets and can watch what's happening.", "D. Davis", "Ken, as you recall, our CapEx is still in 4% revenue, so our CapEx is at a historically low level at this point in time. And you saw during the recession, our ability to flex our fleet. I think we've got probably the biggest strengthening in the industry, adjusting our feet to that demand. So we're very confident we're in a good shape. We still expect there'd be some growth out there going forward though.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So if I could just jump in down on that, how do you think about peak shipping season, do you anticipate kind of that tighter season as we move deeper into August?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, we've -- I think, so far at least looking at Asia, which is really where peak begins, we've not seen very strong indications at least on the ocean front. So if the -- I know last year, actually, we had a little bit of an early blip on ocean, and typically, August is really our ocean peak. And at least, so far, our temperature checks don't suggest a very strong peak that way. Now that may manifest itself into one Airfreight boom later if demand picks up, but we are cautious, I mean, and clearly, you hear us talk on that.", "D. Davis", "Ken, it goes back to what I opened up with on the uncertainty of economy right now. If Congress and the President resolves these debt season issues satisfactorily the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly, and you can see demand picking up. Europe has made some progress in their sovereign debt issues. So the mood can change pretty quickly to resolve some of these issues in front of us. So I wouldn't say we're pessimistic about the future, there's just a lot -- we're uncertain about how much the economy will grow.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Malat of Goldman Sachs.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "The first is on the deferred in ground volumes were up a little bit more than Next Day Air. I just -- I think you tweaked the fuel surcharge program that did narrow the pricing gap between the modes, especially when the fuel prices rise. But can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of trade-downs, how much yield are you seeing?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It is -- certainly, the spread is much narrower than it was back in 2008 when we had the 20%-plus differences between the Air and Ground surcharges. So we think this current environment is much healthier. It allows customers to maintain their normal mix of premium products and standard products, even in the rising fuel. I think if you look back early in the quarter when fuel was bumping 110 or more, we did begin to see some real discussions and some revisiting the supply chains. And so there is a threshold of that which certainly begins it begins to more materially impact the supply chains. As it began to moderate, and it's now sitting below 100 at least, it seems to settle down a little bit. So we watch that pretty carefully. Our intent is not to make this disruptive to customers. It's just really to have a way for us to minimize our volatility, and so far, it's worked pretty well.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then the other one was just -- I'm not sure how much you'll be able to say about this. I know I've gotten a lot of questions on it, and hopefully, you'll speak more detail at the Analyst Day, but I thought I'd give it a shot. Is there a way you can you help us think about the long-term top line growth rate for the company? I mean, a lot of people break it down and get to the numbers of 7% or 6% or 7% or 8% in those kind of ranges, is that too low, and how much can you help us with that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "You're going to have to make the trek to Louisville to hear that, I'm afraid. We'll clearly give some update on our long-term expectations. And we're such a diverse company that you really have to break it down into 7 or 8 categories with Domestic Package, the International package, Freight Forwarding, the Distribution, the LTL. And so we'll speak in detail about our long-range outlook. This really isn't the point to get into to that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "I wanted to see if I could follow up on this topic of customer response to some of the pricing initiatives. If you look at places where you have been successful at, say, implementing significant price change, are you really not seeing anything different in terms of volume behavior there than you're seeing in the broader business?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It's a nuanced issue. I think on the increment, certainly, there are conditions or cases where we may win a little less volume or perhaps have the discretion to part ways on some negotiations. We think, in aggregate, the market has been very realistic and realizes that the market rates have been underperforming over the previous years. So we are continuing to be very disciplined on that, and it's the discussions we have at the executive level anyway about the strategies and how we fit together. Ultimately, the way for us to assure strong yields is to keep improving of our value proposition. So the capabilities we built, the product enhancements, those are the ways we can do this in the long term. And so far, we feel pretty good on the progress we're making.", "D. Davis", "And I think a lot of the customer surveys that have been done over the last 12 months say that the customers are seeing a lot of value for what they're paying for. So I think right now the customers are pleased with the value proposition, as Kurt said.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "I want to see if you could give us a little bit of flavor for what's going on in terms of weight per package. And if possible, if you could differentiate, I don't know if your calculation includes like a rated weight factor, given what you did with the dimensional weights earlier this year. And if you could maybe break that into sort of core weight gain, and what's just sort of optics because of some of the pricing change?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, it's a good question. I think the best overview, I guess, just to give you the footnotes version here is the Ground is up slightly. We're actually seeing slight declines in the overall air products, if you adjust everything out. Not anything dramatic, but we're seeing a little bit of a slowing on the Air Package side anyway, and a slight increase on the Ground.", "D. Davis", "With B2C movement we're seeing on the Air side, more goods being shipped, and B2C the difference is lighter weight products.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and that's core weight you're talking about, not rated weight, right?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "I wanted to talk -- like actually, that's a great transition from that previous question in terms of a little bit of bigger picture. Obviously, near term, we have a lot of uncertainty in the economy, but one of the drivers that I think we're talking a little bit more about over the next 3 to 5 years might be the impact of the e-commerce activity in the Domestic business. And I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, and what you're seeing and how you're positioned there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, I'll kick it off, and then Scott may want to add a little more view for the longer term, but the e-commerce component of our business continues to grow pretty robustly. It's an increasing form of purchase for increasing array, and it's not just a U.S. phenomena. Frankly, we're seeing strong trends on that across the globe. So that we continue to look for ways to best serve that model. We have added or expanded our direct-to-consumer injection in the post office with our SurePost solution. We're very light weight, low value, that's working very well. Plus frankly, we're looking across the globe at ways to help our customers create really global footprints for B2C, and we think that's a long-term trend.", "D. Davis", "Well, I think that's fair. I think it's here to stay and we think B2C will become -- every year will become a little bigger piece of the pie. We're working very closely with some of our bigger customers and how do we solve their problems. I think we're very proud of our reverse logistics portfolio. We talked about the new Returns Exchange program we're going to introduce later this year. We continue to make it easier for our B2C players to be competitive. We have to help them be competitive. It's got to be a pleasing experience for their customers, which means they have to be able to return products if they don't work, if they don't fit. So I think -- and that's why technology is a big advantage for UPS. So we'll be the forefront of this, and it's going to be a fast-growing market moving forward.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Then my follow-up would be, if we, and I know that there's, again, couching the uncertain environment, but if we ended up at that lower end of that GDP forecast, does that start to impact some of the yield initiatives in terms of your ability to pass along those prices? Or as you had said, just a moment ago, the value add that customers are seeing, does that offset that?", "D. Davis", "Yes, I think we've been at the lower end of that. I think you're going to see the second quarter not much better than the first quarter, maybe not as good for GDP. So we've been there, done a very good job on revenue management and growing yields. So I don't see that changing in the near term.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "With the improvement in the results out of the freight division now, I think you guys have done a fairly good job at kind of keeping that infrastructure, the status quo, while you were going through this downturn. Are you starting to see results at freight now? Or you think maybe it's time to start investing more heavily there and trying to grow that footprint much more aggressively?", "Kurt Kuehn", "At least if you're speaking specifically of the UPS Freight segment, we're doing prudent and incremental expansions as it's needed. We'll be likely increasing our investments a little bit in the fleet, but we don't see any huge step functions. It's fairly inexpensive to put up Freight terminals compared to package terminals because of a significantly reduced high-tech equipment in it. So it's not a huge investment for us, probably the major area would just be fleet expansions.", "D. Davis", "We pay a lot of attention to the capacity than market place do. And if that changes, that could change our answer.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay, all right. That makes sense. And then lastly, given how public the postal service's problems have become and with all the rhetoric anywhere from getting rid of Saturday delivery to 15 years from now going to 3-day delivery, whatever it may end up being. Have you seen -- is that uncertainty around their service creating any further opportunities on the parcel side now? Or do you think that, that bears fruit 2 or 3 years from now?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I don't think it's a big issue in the short term. Most of the very deep integrated B2B business is not with the post office, and those are the ones where a long lead time would make a big difference in the supply chain. So they're focusing on finding their strengths and working on the last mile. We are collaborating with them and competing with them. Clearly, the post office have to make dramatic changes to improve their financials, but I don't see that as a big issue for day-to-day customers decisions.", "D. Davis", "Yes, John, I think the Saturday delivery is probably the most imminent issue right now for customers. And there are some looking for different solutions, so that could have a more immediate impact on us. If they do go eventually down the road from 5 days to 3 days, that changes the game pretty dramatically, but that's down the road.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Matt Brooklier of Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies", "A question on Domestic Package. If you can walk us through the quarter from a demand perspective, April, May, June, I don't need numbers. But just generally, how did the quarter progress? And then maybe operating what you're seeing in July at Domestic Package versus June?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It's actually been relatively flat. We had expected coming out of the very bad weather in the first quarter to see things pick up a little bit, and that was kind of our guidance. But as the dust settled on April, and you factored out the holidays and all of that, we think the trends have been sluggish but stable all the way through to the present anyway. So there's really not a big story there.", "Matthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay, there hasn't been any change in July versus what you've witnessed in June?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Not anything that we would consider to be statistically significant.", "Matthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay. And my second question, International  package, can you talk to the new aircraft that you received. When do those aircraft go into service, just generally? And is that part of the improvement on the utilization on those new aircraft and routes? Is that part of the story of the op margin improvement at International Package in the second half of this year?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, absolutely. As we mentioned, we have added a number of planes, and it wasn't -- it's not just this year, we've certainly been taking a lot of 76s and the 747-400, which is the big workhorse for the long-distance flights. And so as we've added those, and there hasn't been any one specific date they've been added ratably over the course of the last year or so. We have -- but we've added significant amounts of capacity, and I guess, the one sequential story we have seen is in the last couple of months that clearly Asia has been slowing. China continues to move pretty strong, upper single digits, but Hong Kong, especially, has seen some headwinds. The comps are a little tougher, but we think still there's true sequential slowing there. And we've been effective with our Forwarding capabilities of keeping our aircraft pretty full. So if you look at the utilization reports, they're doing pretty well. But as we said, the revenue yield on those assets is lower at that rate. So as we continue to grow, and we did see 8% unit growth for package in the International, which is above any of our competitors, that revenue yield mix in our aircraft will improve. So that's the story of -- there's a little bit of a step function in this. And at least right now, we're kind of a point at which we've added a lot of capacity and we've got to maximize the yield in that over the next few quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "I wanted to follow up on the LTL side. You called out a bit of moderation in July, is that beyond seasonal? Just typically, July should be a weaker month, and I was just curious if you're seeing something that's outside of what you'd normally expect?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we think a little more than seasonal. And I don't want to draw too sharp a point on it, but it does look as though things may have moderated a little bit coming into July.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, and around your commentary on peak season and looking out at the back half, curious to just get a little bit more color, what your customers are seeing from an inventory perspective. We've generally heard inventory to sale still feel pretty low. Obviously, that's kind of been consistent throughout this recovery, but would belie, as you said the potential for either ocean freight to pick up in a more normal seasonal time frame, where we see it kind of in the late summer into early fall, or as you said, the possibility of our Airfreight to really pick up. What are your customers telling you? And have they given you any indication of timing, or is your uncertainty based on a fact that they really haven't given you much of anything?", "D. Davis", "I think inventories just aren't tight. I think -- I don't think anybody is building inventories and back  that same overused word of uncertainty. I think people, they are not quite sure of what's going to happen. They've been running on tight inventories. If we can get confidence up a little bit, you may see that rebuild starting. We've seen prior years where they went to the peak season with too low inventory levels and got stuck in the sales opportunities. So we'll watch, but I think the things we have to do in this country, the U.S. is starting with this -- get this debt ceiling resolved, and get some of these behind us, I think confidence will go up, and you'll see people starting to restock inventories.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "I couldn't agree with you more on the debt ceiling. Japan, curious, as auto production comes back in the back half of the year, you guys indicated that you're seeing that return a bit more than normal. How does that impact your business levels? I mean, where do see that the most? I'm assuming on the International air side, but if you could give us a sense of where we could see that impacting volumes in the back half of the year, obviously, predicated on the strength of any kind of auto recovery, but it would be helpful to get some color there.", "D. Davis", "I think the most dramatic impact on us what we saw in the last quarter and obviously next quarter is intra-Asia business, and we have a real strong intra-Asia business that certainly involves Japan. I think that got slowed down dramatically in the second quarter, and we expect that to pick up as we head into July and August, and we're seeing some pick-up there. So I think more dramatic on the intra-Asia for UPS.", "Operator", "Our next version will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I'm just wondering if I can understand sort of the commentary in the third quarter. I think about this year as being a pretty big year for a rebound in pricing, given that we had a couple of rough years there. And yet, the fact that margins aren't likely to go up suggests that unit costs are also kind of rising in line with where the pricing per packages at least in the Domestic market. Am I missing a piece there? Or are we going to have an acceleration from here in pricing? Why wouldn't we be seeing pricing sort of trump everything at this point?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, I think in general, it is still. And if you look at the Q2 to Q3 trends rather than year-over-year, it depends how you frame this, you'll get a little better view. So no, we're continuing to see good results. Our unit cost is expected to continue to grow at a rate below our net yields. So we're not changing the whole story. We've got a blip here in Q3 that we talked to for the specific reasons of very sluggish growth and the tougher comps and some onetime events last year. So that's why we're confident we will show both margin expansion and profit expansion get back into Q4. So if you frame it as a quarter-over-quarter, it looks pretty smooth, the year-over-year, that's why", "We try to be very clear on it. So I wouldn't put too fine a point.", "D. Davis", "I don't think Q3 domestically is much over than Q2 internationally. And Q2 internationally, the trends didn't change. The comps were very difficult. I think we're seeing the same thing domestically, all that to expanding margins in the fourth quarter.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then if we look at the overall sort of guidance, you're sort of saying, \"look we think things are slowing, but we'll still do our guidance.\" Does that suggest that we should be more aggressive here on buybacks? Or are you sort of looking at the balance sheet and saying, \"no, we're comfortable with the rate that were sort of managing at, and we've got to save some dry powder in case there's opportunities.\" Or how do you want to think about the balance sheet?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We ratcheted up the buybacks a little bit in Q3. Clearly, if the market gives us an opportunity to buy back shares at a bargain, we've got tremendous amounts of cash. I mean, you can see on our balance sheet even with the fact that from early in the year we used $1.2 billion to accelerate the pension funding. We're building back up very large reserves of cash. So that's the great story here. We've significantly increased distributions to shareowners, and we meter that a little bit based on what's going on in the market, but we do intend to continue to purchase substantially and could accelerate it if need be.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "I want to follow up on the question John asked with respect to the post office. There is an announcement just yesterday that the post office was going to close about 3,600 locations. On one hand, you compete with them on a number of services. On the other hand, you utilize parts of their delivery network. If the post office were to close 3,600 locations, is this a net opportunity for you? Would it be kind of a net push with some offset? How do you think about that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think anytime a competitor pulls back capacity and access, it's an opportunity. So clearly, we will look at the gaps that are there, and we've got a wonderful footprint with the UPS Store and offering consumers and small businesses good access. So we'll look for opportunities where it makes sense. As Scott mentioned, the more dramatic their network changes, then the more opportunity. At the same time, we'll look for collaboration alternatives as the post office looks to outsource some parts of their network, maybe where they're not best-in-class, so it's a balancing of competing and cooperating.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "I guess, maybe just a more general question on just your view on customer. Scott, you mentioned a couple times, kind of clearing up some of the situation in Washington may help the consumer sentiment perspective. I guess, do you get any sense from your customers that there is some pent-up demand that could start to be seen if we were to get a little bit more policy clarity going forward?", "D. Davis", "I think, clearly, there are -- we've seen the last year and a half, the small business has not participated in the recovery like multinationals, the big business, and I think that once they feel more comfortable with policies going forward, that you'll see them invest more money and hire more people. And we have to get unemployment rates down in this country to get consumer confidence up. So I think that nothing is more important right now than policy certainty for our small business customers.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, and I guess speaking financially from the company's perspective. Certainly, a stronger rebound in the middle market and mainstream would be very positive for us. It's a healthy environment whether there's a broad range of small and medium-sized businesses tendering volume to us. So as Scott mentioned, the largest driver of growth has been multinationals, which is great for filling up the network, but not necessarily as good for yields and margins.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "Sure, so you could see some pick up on the domestic side, that would be my guess there. And then just one final follow-up. Just trying to understand the parsing out a little bit in the Asian market slowdown relative to what you're seeing in Japan. I know you've commented a couple of times on that. I'm just trying to get a sense of the kind of how much of the slowdown you see, maybe still be some lingering intra-Asia effects here or if it's kind of Domestic. Is it U.S., Asia or Europe-Asia type of volumes that you're seeing that sequential slowing?", "D. Davis", "I think in Asia. I mean, certainly China did some of themselves by tightening up reserves. I think they're trying to control inflation. So some of that impact was obviously physically driven. I think some of the impact is driven by lack of consumer confidence both in Europe and the United States. I think that what we're seeing here is a lack of consumer confidence, not buying goods. Imports were not very strong in the U.S. in the second quarter. So I think it's a combination of tightening in Europe, tightening in Asia and lack of consumer confidence both in the U.S. and Europe.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line Elliot Waller of Jefferies.", "Elliott Waller - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "It's Elliot Waller on for Peter. Two quick questions. First, deferred area yields were especially strong, and it didn't look like there was any volume shift from Next Day Air or Ground. What do you think was happening there in terms of yield in deferred air, and was it expedited shipments from Asia or some other factor? And do you think these type of 8.7% yield improvements are sustainable?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, most of the -- typically the direct expedited shipments at Asia which show up in our International products. There's no real strong factor to call out on that. I mean, there's a little bit of moves both ways. We have had success in our revenue management impacts. We do see the market very stable on that area. So I wouldn't -- there's not a real strong point either way, but we do feel confident that these yield management trends would continue. So you may see blips a little bit, plus or minus, product-to-product. But in general, we do feel very confident that the strength of revenue management is holding up even with a sluggish economy and that we're going to continue to execute.", "Elliott Waller - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, good. And second, how much of a drag do you estimate fuel was for the overall quarter. I know you talked about certain segments on company-wide. And then also, what do you expect in 3Q? Has the surcharge caught up at this point?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, it should. Assuming that things stay relatively flat within the range of plus or minus $5 or so, we're probably in good shape. Our guidance assumes upper 90s for fuel. So it should be less of a story. Overall, though, because fuel kind of broke in the middle of May, I guess, and then dropped for Domestic the lag was not material. Although there was a modest headwind on the International side.", "Operator", "And due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Real quick on the air and ocean buy rates, you mentioned the Forwarding business benefited from better buy rates in the quarter. Can you just give  a little more color around what you're seeing from the International air cargo markets, ocean markets? Is one market looser than the other? And are there specific lanes on which there is specifically good pricing for the forwarders?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think, certainly, ocean right now is under a lot of pressure with the peak not showing up, and there's plenty of anecdotes outside of our own experience. So we do see quite a bit of capacity. There have been a number of providers that have added capacity. And at least right now, as Scott mentioned, imports into the U.S. are not super strong. Air is much more lane-specific, but in general, it's a little softer just because the level of activity is down. So these things can change, but at least right now, those are the trends we're  seeing. ", "So we are going to wrap this up pretty soon. In some ways, this call has been as much about the economy as it has UPS. I guess, at least from my perspective on this, the economy will come and go, the cycles will come and go, and clearly, it's impacted our guidance. But the performance of the company is continuing well, and if there's anything you're guys invest in with us, it's adapting to multiple cycles. So we did feel it's important to be clear on these economic trends, but I just still want to focus you back that, that's not all that UPS is about. So Scott?", "Andy Dolny", "We're going to go to Scott for some final comments.", "D. Davis", "Okay, we reported put it strong numbers for the second quarter. UPS like others have made difficult decisions over the last few years. To get leaner and more customer focus, and clearly, we're benefiting from those decisions. Unfortunately, as Kurt said, U.S. economy has not been recovering as quickly as most expected. Grid-locking on Asia's capital clearly is not helping this cause. We need the leadership in Washington to step up and solve the debt ceiling stalemate, approve the free trade agreements and eliminate the uncertainty that's causing many companies to put their plans on hold. As for UPS, I assure you that we're focused on providing superior service to our customers and great returns to our shareholders. Thanks for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to seeing you all in Louisville in September. Thanks so much.", "Andy Dolny", "That concludes our call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now our pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Vice President Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I want to point out that during the call today we will make references to our recent investor conference. For those of you who are unable to attend, all information presented is available on our website. I encourage you to watch it. Based on feedback from those that have, I think you'll find it worthwhile.", "Now regarding our earnings. I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and our expectations going forward.", "Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company.", "These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2010 Form 10-K and 2011 10-Q reports.", "These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Today's call is being webcast, and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website.", "I want to remind you of an adjustment we recorded in the third quarter of last year. The adjustment was related to the sale of real estate and increased net income by $61 million or $0.06 per share.", "As a result, in their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS' third quarter 2010 results excluding the impact of this gain.", "Additionally, all 2011 full year references and comparisons to 2010 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance.", "Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the Financial section. [Operator Instructions]", "Now to begin our review, I'll turn the program over to Scott.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. It was great seeing you at our conference in Louisville. I hope you came away with the better understanding of our many capabilities and the investments we're making for the future. UPS delivered another good quarter of earnings growth.", "Highlighting the balance of our global business model and its ability to perform in the face of challenging economic conditions. Results like these reflect the value that UPS solutions are providing customers. There is increasing uncertainty in the global economic environment, most notably, exports from Asia, which slowed significantly during the quarter.", "On the other hand, it appears that the U.S. economy has stabilized and continues to show modest growth. Despite all the concerns of the European economy, our business there continues to perform well with exports up 9%.", "The outlook for the remainder of the year is for continued slow growth. Because we have seen less buildup of inventories heading into peak season, UPS could benefit if consumers respond with stronger than expected holiday purchases just like it did in 2009. We really won\u2019t know this until the 2 weeks prior to Christmas as peak has become more compressed.", "Taking a step in the right direction, I want to congratulate Congress and the Administration for approving the critical trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.", "Export growth in these countries will provide economic growth and create jobs here at home. I'm encouraged to finally see some bipartisan cooperation and hopeful that our leadership in Washington can continue to work together to stimulate our economy like a jobs bill that delivers real results and tax reform that encourages business investment.", "Here at UPS, we are not standing by waiting for the government or the economy to lead us. As we demonstrated during our conference, we continue to innovate and invest in the technology and solutions that our customers value.", "Recently, we rolled out several innovative, groundbreaking products. The most notable being UPS My Choice, which provides consumers with unparalleled delivery options. This service puts controls in the hand of the residential customer. As a secondary benefit, it helps UPS lower costs by eliminating multiple delivery attempts. Since the recent launch of this product, we have over 100,000 subscribers and that number continues to increase rapidly.", "To support our continued growth in Europe, we announced a significant expansion of the Cologne air hub. This $200 million project will include state-of-the-art UPS technology and boost capacity by more than 70%.", "Capital investments like this allow us to grow our network efficiently and achieve the return on investment capital goals unveiled at our conference.", "As we outlined there, UPS' solution-based approach spans the entire Supply Chain. These global capabilities are unmatched and customers recognize the value UPS provides. The conductivity across business units and the reach of our network continues to drive results.", "Though economists expect global economic growth for 2012 to remain below historic trends, I am confident in our ability to perform, rewarding share owners during both the current period of uncertainty and over the long term.", "With that said, let me turn it over to Kurt.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. On last quarter's call, some thought that UPS was a little ahead of the curve with our economic outlook. However, during the past few months, we did witness the effects of economic slowing and continue to see the near-term outlook pointing to slow but steady growth. Now let's discuss UPS' third quarter results.", "With the exception of the International segment, UPS performance during the quarter held up well, especially considering the economic conditions and increased uncertainty.", "UPS experienced strong revenue growth of 8% and once again earnings per share improved at a double-digit rate, up 14%.", "Now let's take a look at the segment performance starting with U.S. Domestic. Operating margin is the highest we've experienced in 3 years, improving 60 basis points to 13.1%. Clearly, this segment is on the right track. Revenue increased almost 7% on flat daily package growth. Our focus on quality of revenue is paying off as yields were once again strong, up 6.5%.", "Base price increases of about 3% and higher fuel surcharges were the key factors.", "UPS Next Day Air volume gains were encouraging, up more than 1% with strong growth from packages offsetting the decline in letters.", "Operating leverage was apparent as improvements in productivity and investments in UPS technology helped produce operating profit growth of more than 11%.  In fact, we once again experienced reductions in direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours.", "During the quarter, we took another step in extending our early morning delivery advantages when we announced the expanded coverage of UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. We've added or improved coverage on 1,300 zip codes, which solidifies our market-leading position.", "Now for the International segment, which is both about slowing economic activity and challenging comparisons to strong results last year.", "If you recall in Q3 '10, we experienced 47% volume growth in the Asia-to-U.S lane. This year, in the third quarter, UPS International operating profit declined slightly due to excess capacity, higher fuel prices and a slight drag from currency fluctuations.", "Remember, during our second quarter earnings call, we mentioned that due to macro conditions, exports from Asia were starting to exhibit softness. This eventually turned into volume declines on the Asia-to-U.S. lane.", "UPS acted swiftly to take down aircraft and full capacity out of the market, but not quickly enough, and margins were negatively impacted.", "Bottom line is, we built a network expecting a certain level of growth that did not materialize. Because of this we have now reduced our airlift capacity out of Asia while still maintaining our recently added service enhancements. If demand continues to soften, we can make additional adjustments.", "On the other hand, UPS is capable of adding back capacity if the surge and consumer demand occurs before peak like it did in 2009. Despite this slowdown, UPS' International revenue jumped more than 14%, driven by solid volume growth in other theaters. Export volume was strong, up 6.5%. UPS continues to lead the industry in international export growth. However, during the quarter, this growth occurred in the shorter trade lanes, such as within Europe or within Asia, as well as across North America.", "Non-U.S. Domestic volume increased 3.5% with strong growth in Germany, France and Poland. Package yields were up more than 9% as a result of currency, higher fuel surcharges and base rate increases. These were offset somewhat by changes in product mix as the growth in our transporter products outpaced Worldwide Express. On a currency-neutral basis, yields grew 3.2%.", "To support our International growth, we announced the expansion of UPS WorldShip to 25 additional origin countries, bringing the total number to 63.", "Now let's discuss the Supply Chain and Freight segment. As a perfect example of leveraging our technology across the entire portfolio, we have extended the UPS Paperless Invoice to include airfreight shipments. Now our customers can enjoy the most comprehensive, digital customs clearance option offered in the industry.", "Revenue for the segment was $2.3 billion, up more than 5% compared to last year. Operating profits were $195 million, with margin expanding to 8.3%.", "UPS Freight lead the way with margin expansion and solid revenue improvement to 15%. LTL revenue per hundredweight was up over 13%, resulting from higher fuel surcharges and stronger base rates.", "Revenue in the Forwarding business unit was muted due to excess capacity in the airfreight industry and the slowing demand from Asia. However, margin expanded and operating profit grew slightly.", "As expected, the Distribution business experienced a mid- single-digit increase in revenue while margin expansion was impacted by investments in the health care sector.", "During the quarter, we continued to expand our global health care distribution presence with the addition of facilities in Brazil and the Netherlands. These new buildings bring the total UPS health care compliance space to more than 4.5 million square feet.", "Regarding taxes. We have lowered our expected tax rate for 2011 to 34% based on the geographic mix of taxable income and other items. This impacted the third quarter and will impact the fourth as well.", "Now let's talk about cash flow. For the first 9 months of 2011, UPS generated free cash flow of more than $3.7 billion after capital expenditures of $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion in pension contributions.", "Distributions to share owners accelerated during the quarter as UPS significantly increased share repurchase activity. Given the weak market conditions, we jumped at the opportunity and increased share buybacks to more than $1.1 billion in the quarter.", "So far this year, UPS has repurchased 32 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion and paid dividends of $1.5 billion, an 11% increase in dividends per share.", "Regarding our guidance for the remainder of 2011. As I indicated at the Investor Conference, we are reiterating our earnings per share guidance of $4.15 to $4.40 per share. As we think about peak season, it seems a lot like last year where customer sentiment is mixed and cautiously optimistic.", "In general, inventory levels are tight and consumer demand for the holidays remains to be seen. As we have experienced in the past, the last 2 weeks before Christmas can have a meaningful impact on fourth quarter results.", "In our U.S. Domestic business, we expect year-over-year margin expansion similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, as we continue our focus on quality of revenue and improved efficiency. Daily package volume growth is expected to be 1% to 2% for the quarter. International volume and revenue growth is expected to outpace the market once again. Revenue should increase approximately 10%, driven by strong growth in inter-regional shipments. We expect the growth environment out of Asia to improve a bit. Operating profit is expected to be slightly above last year's level with operating margin in the mid-teens.", "For the Supply Chain and Freight segment, we expect moderate year-over-year revenue growth and continued margin expansion.", "So to wrap this up, UPS continues to produce quality earnings growth in an environment of moderate economic activity. We remain confident in our ability to succeed in these conditions and expect to produce record earnings per share for 2011.", "Thanks for listening this morning, and now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Jon Langenfeld of Baird.", "Jon A. Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "On the Domestic side, the International piece, I know you had a pretty tough comp there, margins came in better than you had talked about. But if I think about that over the next couple years and kind of playing out a relatively subdued growth environment, is there still enough room from the pricing offsetting the cost to move this higher as we progress over the next couple of years?", "Andy Dolny", "John, this Andy. Are you talking International Domestic or U.S. Domestic?", "Jon A. Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I'm talking about the Domestic -- overall Domestic on the profit margin side.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. We feel pretty happy about our continued momentum in the Domestic business, even in a muted growth environment with a focus on yields and the broad productivity improvements leveraging many of the things we talked about at the conference. We are continuing to see margin expansion. Clearly, it's a lot easier in a more robust economy and time will tell how 2012 looks. But as long as we keep focusing on our effectiveness and improve the value proposition with things like My Choice, we feel pretty bullish about the long-term Domestic opportunity.", "D. Scott Davis", "I think, Jon, we'll stay in a rational price environment, which will also help us enhance the margins.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Andy, you talked about -- or Kurt, I guess you talked about the story of decreasing letters going on for years. I just want to know, as you talked about the focus, we could see kind of a sharp rebound into the peak season here, so can you talk about -- when you talk about Next Day Air, is that kind of where the focus will feel at first? Do you see ground kind of feeling some of that in a rebounding economy and kind of on the mix changes within that Next Day Air? Does that impact it as well?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Ken. Clearly, we've been pleased with our progress in the Air business with the financial industry continuing to struggle and the housing industry weak. It does negatively impact the Letter business, but we've seen good growth in our Next Day Package, both with the a.m commitments and with the afternoon commitments. So we do see most of the growth in the package arena as supply chains continue to speed up and that is accentuated in an improving economic environment.", "D. Scott Davis", "Ken, I think the lean inventories that our customers are stocking right now could certainly lead us to stronger both International and Domestic Air Express business in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Could you talk a little bit about the tax rate changes, and how that will be or not be sustainable into the fourth quarter and beyond?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we had guided at the beginning of the year to a range of 34% to 35%, and we do expect overall that the rate will come in at the low-end of that range at 34%. And it's a combination of the geographic mix of our earnings and some minor specific settlements. So it really just means that we are coming in at the lower end of the range and we'll probably see a similar adjustment in Q4 as we had in Q3.", "D. Scott Davis", "And David, in January, we'll talk about the rate for next year as we look at the expected earnings, distribution of earnings.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JP Morgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to ask you about the International side and get a sense of how significant the cost take-out and network adjustment is on transpacific, I guess, in terms of how much cost reduction we can look at in fourth quarter. And then also if you want to comment on pricing within International given that capacity utilization came down a bit.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I think, Tom, the good news is, is that the pricing has remained stable in the International environment. It is a rational environment. Clearly, on the Cargo and the Freight side, the pricing is a little weaker and that benefits our Forwarding unit. We do expect to see the International demand firm up a little bit in Q4 with some product launches that last year were in the third quarter that are now in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, though, we did take a substantial amount of capacity out so we've lowered our year-over-year capacity out of Asia by about 10% or so and we'll continue to look at that. We did -- we have made, though, over the last year, 1.5 years a number of substantial enhancements with the direct flights to Europe and some of those things. And we do think that investing in that and continuing to leverage that platform is wise, but we'll adjust and adapt as the economy tweaks it. But right now, we feel like we're in pretty good shape, and borrowing further declines, we should be pretty well-calibrated.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Morgan Keegan.", "Arthur W. Hatfield - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Kurt, given your comments about pricing, can you talk a little bit about the sequential decline in yields. Was that -- my assumption was that fuel had been -- surcharges had been flat throughout the quarter, was that a -- was I wrong about that, one? And 2, was it a mix issue?", "Kurt Kuehn", "The international showed -- did see some impact and that's really that demonstration of the mix. As we said, we showed continued strong growth. European exports, most of which stay in the continent, grew upper single digits. North America trade continued strong, so there's a mix within that International export that did have an impact and if you take out the currency and the fuel, certainly that was a somewhat negative impact on yields. But we think on a same-package basis or a same-store basis that yields remain firm and there are some mix changes, but all in all, we feel very comfortable both domestically and international that the value proposition is such that we're able to sustain good yields.", "D. Scott Davis", "Domestically, the yields between the third quarter and second quarter were very similar, there really was no degradation, whatsoever.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue comes from the line of Mr. Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "The International profitability just feels like it's been an issue now that that's more than just a slowdown in demand and your International volumes weren't that terrible. International has a lot of things going on. Is there some part of the world where profitability is becoming a bigger issue relative to what you saw most of the last 5 or 6 years?", "D. Scott Davis", "First of all the question is Europe, that's not the answer. Europe has stayed very strong. We\u2019ve had -- we're very pleased with performance and profitability out of Europe. I mean, clearly, this was an Asia issue. And as you know, we had the most leverage both positive and negative coming out of Asia and it's tough to get the network cut down quick enough. But clearly, issue here was Asia in the third quarter and the second quarter.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And I guess I will comment that we're just showing a very slight decline of profits, 2%. Just the impact of fuel and currency would more than account for that. So we're not pleased with the third quarter results, but we're taking steps and we feel very confident that the International segment is going to continue to outgrow and we had a pretty sudden change in Asia. We telegraphed that in July and talked about it also in September. So it is a challenge, but we still feel very positive on the long-term prospects for the International.", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Can you talk to the Asia capacity in terms of what you were built for growth and what capacity you took out and so what you're aligned for growth right now from Asia and what the volumes actually were in the quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It's all -- you really have to look lane by lane, Ed. We did actually go to negative on the U.S. to Asia lane, and clearly, that's a lane that we have substantial capacity. The other lanes remained positive. Actually, Asia to Europe continued to look good. And as I said, we did take out approximately 10% of capacity in the quarter, and barring continual declines, we should be in better shape.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I was a little distracted early on in the prepared comments. I think you said that core pricing was up 3% year-over-year. And I was hoping you could you just elaborate on that data point a little bit more? Is that a mix neutral sort of same sales number, #1. Is that just Domestic? How did that compare to the last couple of quarters and do you sort of see that number being the base level going forward?", "Kurt Kuehn", "That was a Domestic reference, and it was weighted average of all the products. The Grounds, probably a little higher than the average, and the Air is a little lighter than the average. Clearly, that's not a big change. And in general, those trends are pretty darn similar to Q2 if you x it all out. So as you know, we continue to focus on creating as much value as possible and pricing accordingly, and that's gone very well this year.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Is that mixed neutral or does it incorporate the mix so that if mix deteriorated modestly to slower modes during the quarter, that sort of the same-store pricing might have been a little bit better than that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "The only place that would be relevant a little bit might be in some of the premium services where we are seeing high -- little higher growth in the afternoon services versus the a.m. So yes, you could adjust that out. We're seeing a similar trend, although slight in the International too, with a little higher growth in our standard services.", "Andy Dolny", "Just a reminder, please. One question per caller, and if you have a second, please get back into queue.Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "As you look across the International environment, you said you parked some airplanes to manage the decline in volumes in the third quarter. Have you seen any improvement in October volumes? And how much of an uptick do you need to see to bring capacity back online?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We have seen, I guess, it differs by theater a little bit. Asia, we are seeing some firming. Certainly, some of that is due to these major product launches that you read about in the paper. Europe remains fairly stable, although clearly, we are probably a little bit cautious on Europe with all the headline risk. And the U.S., perhaps a little bit softer, but not a big change in trends.", "D. Scott Davis", "I'd just say just in the economy in general, we're probably a little more optimistic than we were 1 or 2 months ago. We've had a lot of good economic reports. In the U.S., retail sales are looking -- better last month, unemployment claims are improving, manufacturing is getting better, bank loans are increasing. So I think we feel a little bit better. And that's been the problem on Asia exports, the demand of the U.S. has slowed down, and somewhat in Europe, demand has slowed down, so I think if we can get some decision-making done in Washington and Brussels, you'll see a firmer demand going forward, which obviously will help Asian exports.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Kurt, just some data points, if you can provide them, FX impact and if you have some sense for pension for 2012, pension expense that is.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Bill, we clearly show the FX impact for the -- on the revenue side and there was fairly significant impact. On the P&L though, we actually had a slight negative impact for FX, cost us about $0.01 or so. It's a combination of some of the collars we put on where it capped our coverage and also some strengthening in Asia against the dollar. So it's a mixed issue, not a huge trend, but it was headwind.", "D. Scott Davis", "The pension, Bill, is going to be obviously determined by the discount rate at December 31, so we can't calculate that yet. Returns on our plans have been pretty good this year despite the turmoil of the market. So it's all going to depend on the discount rates. So we won't know that number until we announce it in January.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Rob Byde of HSBC.", "Robin Byde - HSBC, Research Division", "Just on Europe and the Cologne hub. Night flyings are recently being banned, at least temporarily, at Frankfurt Airport. Is this likely to be a concern for your plans at Cologne?", "D. Scott Davis", "We feel pretty comfortable with the relationship we have at Cologne. And certainly, as we discuss these expansions with the administrators at Cologne Airport, we've got assurances that we're in good shape for many years to come.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "When you think about the fourth quarter outlook on the International side, is that supported by kind of the product launches and the firming that you've been seeing in Asia? Or is there -- do you need to see any ramp-up going into the holiday season or would that all be upside relative to your expectations as it stands right now?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, certainly, if there's a little bit of an inventory squeeze, and I'd say there's a decent probability of that, then there is some upside. As Scott mentioned earlier, especially those long transpacific routes, there's incredible leverage on. And so to some extent, you make your bets and you see how it comes through. There does seem to be a little uptick as Scott had said in sentiment right now and that could create the need to speed up supply chains. Clearly, the flooding in Southeast Asia is a challenge that may also lead to some late hurry-up orders to catch up on supply. That's one of the reasons we've been, I guess, balanced in our capacity reductions, taking enough out that we don't feel like we've got too much, but at the same time, keeping enough infrastructure in place to capitalize on the benefit.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I wanted to talk a little bit as we talk about some of the trends shifting internationally more from maybe exporting to more of the intra-regional trade networks within Europe and Asia. I was wondering if you could talk a little about what you're doing to take advantage of that and what kind of growth opportunities you see as maybe some of those economy shift a little bit?", "D. Scott Davis", "We talked, Nate, a lot about this the last quarter at the Investor Conference that we really have invested pretty heavily in our intra-Asia network as it is probably the fastest growing business in the world right now. So we've obviously improved Time-In-Transit. We've added a lot more flights between locations over there and we'll continue to invest heavily as we go forward, but I think, generally, we're focused on, we're paying a lot of attention to and probably made our heaviest investments this year.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And really the combination of the intra-Asia flights as Asia trades more with itself and the continuing migration of integrated supply chains in Europe tends to drive the intra-European shipments also. So we remain very focused and bullish on both those theaters.", "D. Scott Davis", "And again, I think we're not writing off Asia exports to the U.S. I think, as the U.S. economy stabilizes, you're going to see more demand for Asian products. So I think you will see a pick-up then. But this quarter or next quarter, you're going to see exports in Asia the U.S. pick up again.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Christopher Ceraso of Credit Suisse.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So it seems like most of the weakness in your International margins are the declines in Asia, maybe some mix going to shorter haul flights and some FX, but was there any hit from your expansion in Germany because you've got extra capacity or you're  spending there? And if not, is that something you think might weigh on results in Q4 or Q1 of next year?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Not material. I mean, we certainly have been in the growth and in expansion mode in International, both with aircraft and with the sales resources and some other things. So we have been investing for growth and we continue to see the benefits of that with UPS far exceeding any of our competitors' profits and growth rates. So we are probably a little bit heavier on the investment side than on average, so there's some exposure if growth doesn't materialize, but no single -- the Cologne expansion is the -- would be the biggest capital investment in Europe, and clearly, that hasn't really broken ground yet.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, I want to reiterate though that Europe has stayed strong. Kurt talked about upper single digit growth. Last quarter, our profits were good. So we're comfortable. I mean, everybody is worried about the headlines, about Europe's economy, but our business has stayed strong and we expect it to stay strong going forward.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel Nicolaus.", "David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "On the LTL side, it looks like you guys are still in freight selection mode. Can you talk a little bit about excess capacity that's in the network and when you think you want to chase volume and add density?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we continue to be pleased with our progress there. As we said, freight shipments were basically flat this quarter. We think that's pretty much in line with the industry. We do see the market proceeding towards a more healthy outcome. Clearly, we've been consistent on our revenue management policies, but many of our competitors have been pretty erratic. So we're continuing to focus on value and offering a unique proposition to customers and we will dial-up our aggressiveness on market share as we see the right time in the industry. But at this point, we're pretty pleased with the progress we're making.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Brooklier of Piper Jaffrey.", "Matthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I think you may have talked a little bit to it, but wanted to get kind of the all-in impact from fuel in the quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Fuel was a modest tailwind for the Domestic and a modest headwind for the International. It wasn't a huge number either way. But in International, the absolute level of fuel is more important, whereas, in Domestic, it's primarily a timing issue. So in aggregate, it's not a big story, but it did help the Domestic a bit and was a headwind for the International.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "It's Rob Salmon on for Justin. There's been a lot of talk, I guess, about the aircraft capacity coming out of Asia. You guys indicated you took out about 10% of capacity out of those lanes. Could you give me a sense of how freight load factors trended in Q2, where we were in Q3 and kind of where they are directionally thus far in October?", "D. Scott Davis", "Clearly, with the softening in Asia, capacity utilization across the freight networks dropped fairly substantially. And Ocean Freight clearly was kind of underwhelming this year with the normal peak being certainly smaller than we expected. We've really not written a story yet on airfreight, as I said. We think there is certainly a decent probability that there'll be a bit of a squeeze in the next couple of months, but at least so far to date, the air buildup has been fairly modest. So we remain cautious in that theater. It is a benefit for the margins on our Forwarding group and certainly, helped us to generate the 8.3% margin in that segment, but we do remain cautious. There are a lot of players and there's some risk of overcapacity, certainly.", "D. Scott Davis", "This time in 2009, we did not see the airfreight peak that happened. So it's -- because holiday season is so compressed, it is down to just a few weeks in December now. You won't see it for a while, but at this time -- this call in 2009, we did not see peak that we're heading into. So can't say it's going to happen in 2011, but it's  showing possibility.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "When we're thinking about kind of how full the planes are coming out of Asia, could you give us a sense of the magnitude of where we are in October versus where we had been in Q3, kind of following the adjustments you guys have made to the network?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It's really too soon to lock that in, I guess. With the product launches and some of the normal volatility, it's too early for us to make a call on -- if we've nailed capacity and demand perfectly on the balance. Remember though that we do have the ability to, as a very strong forwarder, to help smooth out the utilization of our airline with utilization of our forwarding capacity. So in aggregate, if you look at both business segments combined, it does reduce the volatility.", "D. Scott Davis", "What I'll say, we're planning on growth out of Asia in the fourth quarter, and we have less capacity so that should help utilization.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Some of these have been answered already. You mentioned the $0.01 per share impact of currency. You mentioned fuel was a drag on International, so if I had to look at the International decline in profits versus a year ago, how much did the fuel impact that? How much of that was more volume mix impact? You've already identified the currency aspect.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, if you factor out the 2 commodities, the fuel and the currency, clearly, we would've shown decent profit increases, probably, mid-single digit profit increases, maybe a little better. And then the product mix jumps around on us and this was one of the most volatile quarters. I mean, if you think of where we were at the beginning of the quarter and the whole roller coaster we've been on with demand and expectations around this global trade, that we were pleased that we continue to see growth in those regional shipments but with a high leverage. Those long-distance runs has clearly had an impact on the margins.", "D. Scott Davis", "I think, Jeff, again, a lot of this was driven by concern and uncertainty in the United States when after the first and second quarter GDP numbers came out and got revised down. There was a lot of concern of a double dip and people stopped buying, stopped consuming. In the last month or so, we're starting to see actually better economic numbers. So there's more optimism out there and that could change -- that could turn things around. We're still expecting a slow growth in economy, but I don't think it's negative as people were thinking 2 and 3 months ago.", "Kurt Kuehn", "So we are confident that the International segment will be back on a profit growth trend and continue to market share gains. How rapid that profit growth is will depend somewhat on the mix of how the next couple of months come together.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "You identified a 2014 LTL EBIT margin of 6% as a target. I guess I'm wondering, in addition to volume and price improvement, are there some operational changes required to achieve this?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Certainly, continued leverage of technology in our freight operation is a big part of the margin improvements. We had a good quarter this quarter, about 2/3 of the way to that goal as far as margins are concerned. But we're leveraging a lot of the technology that we manage our business with both on the line haul and the pick-up and delivery to streamline the freight. And that's part of the synergies that we bring. Much as we added paperless invoice to our airfreight shipments to streamline the customs clearance, we're also bringing the operational technology to the UPS Freight. And it's likely we'll have some other exciting announcements continuing on the UPS Freight both for the customer benefit and the operational.", "Operator", "Have a question from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Company.", "David P. Campbell", "I think my question has been answered. But just to make sure, is there a quarter of tonnage, and the Asia-Pacific region was up for you, but I assume that when you talk about product mix, what you mean in the fourth quarter is that there will be more growth or less of a decrease in your Package business in the fourth quarter and that's what's driving a better results and higher yields per tonne. Is that one way to look at it?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No, David, you're a little too optimistic. We actually did see volume declines in our International business on the Small Package. The Forwarding was down also, but sometimes the volume that hits our planes or doesn't hit it can move around. So no, we did see low single-digit declines in exports out of Asia, which is unusual for us. We are expecting that to get back up to modest increases for Q4. But no, there were real sequential or year-over-year declines at least, but was part of the problem.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Wanted to see if I could get a little bit of flavor for some of the moving pieces in the Domestic segment. I clearly hand you that the comps are getting a lot tougher from a margin perspective, but you still have pricing that I think you said up 2% to 3%. Volumes looked actually okay in that segment, better than at least I was expecting. So just curious if there's sort of something going on, on the cost side that is slowing that down and whether or not that's something that could look better in future periods if these trends continue with volume and price the way you've been seeing them.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, it's a good question. Clearly, we did pretty well in a flat growth environment. We improved margins 60 basis points, but the comps versus last year on the comp and benefits were tougher and it was part of why we had fairly cautious guidance on that. But typically, the third quarter is a quarter where we true-up our self-insured liabilities, workers comps, some of those things. And the adjustment we made in 2010 was a much larger credit than what we saw in 2011. So that did cause the comp and benefit line to be a little higher in comparison to volume than normal. We don't -- that is basically a onetime event, although, it does get adjusted every year. So we continue to be optimistic, that's why we remain committed to the range we've done and are seeing great operational results and are expecting volumes to begin picking up a bit in the fourth quarter.", "D. Scott Davis", "Key ways we talked about in the past to improve the margins, Gary, is to get, our average weight rate is still high because we're not growing the business enough. And right now productivity is same as half of that in wage increase. We can get that average weight increase down by bringing in lower seniority employees, that's going to help us an awful lot. So instead of saving half of the wage increase can save much more than that with the productivity improvements.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just to be clear, the things you were mentioning, Kurt, like the workers comp, et cetera, those are not things that are uniquely hurting 3Q. Those are things that we should expect to continue in the run rate looking forward, right?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It's really primarily a this year, last year comparison for the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jason Seidl of Dalhman Rose.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "If we look at the volumes in Asia, you mentioned they're expecting to pick up a little bit here in 4Q due to some of the product launches. Were you expecting to be up a few x out the product launches in 4Q?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It's almost impossible to factor that out. There's always product launches going on, as to whether it would be positive or not, I'm not sure. We've had estimates of some of the product launches and you have some for multiple companies every year. But we do see Asia without the product launches getting a little firmer. I guess, that's the bottom line.", "D. Scott Davis", "It really comes down though -- it comes to your, I guess your projections of demand out of Europe and demand out of United States. And right now, there's some cautious optimism, as Kurt said earlier, on the peak season in the United States where the National Retail Federation is calling for a 2.8% increase in sales, which is actually higher than average for the last 10 years. Not as good as last year, but higher than the average for the last 10 years. If that happens, that will create demand. But as I said before, it's a compressed season, so we'll have to wait and see.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Rob Pickels of Manning & Napier.", "Robert F. Pickels", "Just following up on the International market. You talked about demand in your own capacity. I'm curious a little bit about competitive capacity. I mean, one of your biggest competitors has been buying a lot of long-haul planes. Is that a chief sort of competitive capacity issue or you're also seeing it from smaller competitors or airlines? Just comment a little bit on that, and then are you seeing any of your competitors take down capacity as you have?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No. We are seeing some of our competitors react and take down excess capacity. Some of them have rechanged their routes to improve their utilization, and may be doing some fuel tech stops. But it's not just the express carriers, as you mentioned, there are other players, some of the foreign flag aircraft that have added some capacity. So we do think the market is rational, but clearly, when you make those big investments, you have to plan for the long-term. And so far, though, we do see people adjusting and taking some capacity out. So we don't think there's much risk of this thing getting drastic with a dramatic imbalance, but we do have to be cautious.", "D. Scott Davis", "We're taking out capacity and we generate probably double the margins of our competitors, so you think there's got to be a lot of pressure on them to reduce capacity going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JP Morgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Some kind of follow-up question for you in terms of the pension beyond 2012. Going into this year, you had put in large cash contributions, I think, I guess, in 2010, then you had a pretty large contribution in January this year which offset some of what would have been the pension expense pressure this year. I'm wondering if you would consider -- if it looks like the discount rate is lower and going to cause pressure on pension expense in 2012, if you would also consider a large cash contribution which would mitigate some of the potential expense pressure in 2012.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Tom, we'll talk in certainly much more detail on the next quarter about our expectations for that. We did have about $0.07 headwind this year for increased pension expense. And with these frustratingly low discount rates, it does create some real challenges at least from an accounting perspective on the earning side. However, we feel pretty confident that over time, these incredibly low rates will come back up to a more normal historical level, which would do wonders for some of the plans. Having said that, our plan is in great shape as you mentioned, with the funding we did early in the year. We're pretty much 100% funded. So if rates stay this low through the end of the year, there will be some headwinds on our, at least our reported expense for the plan, but it will still be very well funded. And at least at this point, we're not planning for major additional funding, anything that would be outside the normal.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on the European volume story. Kind of within Europe, are you seeing a different mix as far as the transporter standard versus kind of overnight inside of Europe?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, a little bit, a little bit. The blessing and the curse of this grade integrated network is it's very easy for customers to move up and down the portfolio. It was a tremendous strength for us during the recession because customers could trade down to the portfolio to save money rather than trading out. So we're seeing a little bit of that. Is it the beginning of a trend or is it just a blip, we're not sure yet. But we have seen, in the last quarter, a little bit of an acceleration in the growth in our more standard products and slower growth in our premium products. But all in all, Europe exports grew upper single digits, which is, I think, far above the market. We'll hear from some of our other competitors in the next couple of weeks and see, but we remain very confident that we've got a very strong value proposition there and are helping customers compete in a challenging environment.", "D. Scott Davis", "I might add, we do very well on profitability in our transporter standard. So just because you're trading down, doesn't mean you're hurting your profitability.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Yes, I was going to ask you, so is it a similar delta than the premium to differ in the U.S. versus in transporter Europe or is it a little less?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I guess the trick in the short term is that the premium products tend to have more fixed costs, and that the extreme is the Asia to U.S. lines. So it's mainly an issue for us of adapting our network, rightsizing, getting the right size plane and the right assets. And so over time, as Scott says, we can adjust and continue to generate the incredible margins that we're able to, no matter what the product mix. But in the short term, it can create some challenges to adapting the assets.", "Operator", "Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel Nicolaus.", "David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Could you talk a little bit about the guidance range, Kurt? You didn't narrow it at all going into the fourth quarter and we only have one quarter left. Kind of looking at, the expectations you've laid out for the fourth quarter looks as if you're going to be in the lower end of the guidance range and so there's a lot of upside there. Is the fourth quarter, you mentioned that the consumer spend is better than people expect, is that much upside leverage to the model where you could potentially hit the upside of that range?", "Kurt Kuehn", "David, I don't want to get in detailed specifics on it. Clearly, we've migrated over the last couple of years to an annual guidance. If we think there's a risk of going out of that, either the positive or the negative, we would adjust. But it has been a bit of a roller coaster in the last few months anyway. We've taken a hard look at it. We are very confident that we will complete the year in that guidance. And with the uncertainty in the U.S. on the holidays, with the volatility we've seen across the globe, we figured we'd leave us a pretty wide range and not try to thread the needle for the remainder of the year anyway. So we remain optimistic, but we do think that since peak becomes more and more intense and more and more short, we thought it safe just to go ahead and stay with this current annual range.", "D. Scott Davis", "David, I said last quarter, I thought that the economy could be anywhere between 1% and 3.5% in the second half of the year and where the economy ended up could drive where we are in the range. So I think there's a good chance we're going to be somewhere in the middle of it, in that economy, the economic forecast of 1% to 3.5%. So we feel pretty comfortable keeping the range where it is. Still, as Kurt said, the holiday season has a big wide range on the results, so we left it where it was.", "Operator", "That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Dolny.", "Andy Dolny", "Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Scott for some final comments.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Now UPS produced solid results as we managed through the economic soft patch in the third quarter, but now we're starting to see a number of developments that give me optimism. U.S. economy is stable in showing modest growth. We've started to see important decisions being made in both Washington and Brussels, although much more action is needed there. UPS is ready with a global integrated network in place to support stronger growth going forward. As we look for the rest of the year, UPS is prepared to meet the needs of our customers and finish up the year with a strong fourth quarter as we achieve record earnings per share for the year.

My name is Stephen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations' Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning, everyone. I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO; Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and expectations going forward. Before they begin however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. ", "Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of the operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2010 Form 10-K and 2011 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast, and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website.", "On Friday, January 27, UPS announced an accounting change relating to expense recognition for company-sponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans, adopting a mark-to-market methodology. This new method implemented in the fourth quarter of 2011 is preferable and will result in simpler, more transparent financial reporting.", "As we said on our call last Friday, mark-to-market pension accounting provides several benefits. It's simpler, as gains and losses outside of the 10% corridor are recognized in the year incurred rather than amortized. It provides more transparency to UPS' underlying results, and it's considered preferable by GAAP since it more closely aligns with fair value principles. And remember, there is no impact on benefits to participants, pension plan funding or UPS cash flow. It is an accounting change.", "As we outlined on Friday, as a result of adopting this new methodology, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by $0.03 for the fourth quarter and $0.12 for 2011. In addition, a 2011 mark-to-market charge of $827 million was recorded in the fourth quarter. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter and total year will be reduced by $0.51 and $0.41, respectively. This is inclusive of both the benefit from the accounting change and the mark-to-market adjustment.", "This accounting change must be applied retrospectively. As a result, 2010 adjusted diluted EPS and GAAP diluted EPS were reduced by $0.08 and $0.15, respectively. To assist in comparisons, revised results for prior periods back to 2007 have been provided. The impact to UPS financials are shown on the web schedules and described in detail in the presentation we distributed last week. The presentation and the web schedules are available on our website.", "I wanted to point out that we included a few extra financial schedules in this morning's quarterly package. For both the fourth quarter and 2011 full year, we provided 3 selected financial data schedules: One that provides adjusted and GAAP results under the new pension accounting methodology, a second under the previous method and a third that reconciles the two. We hope you find this information helpful. Separate from pension, in the fourth quarter of 2010, UPS recorded a net $58 million gain on the sale of certain non-core assets in its Supply Chain and Freight segment. The after-tax benefit was $32 million or $0.03 per share. ", "During this morning's call, all 2011 fourth quarter and full year references and comparisons to 2010, will refer to adjusted results unless otherwise noted.  We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations' website in the financial section.", "Finally, in an effort to allow maximum participation on today's call, each participant will be allowed one question and then be required to get back in the queue for any follow-up. I hope you understand. And thank you for your cooperation. Now, let me turn it over to Scott.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. I hope all of you had a safe and Happy New Year. I can tell you that during December, we were very busy at UPS, ensuring holiday shipments arrived where they needed to be all around the world. In fact, we experienced our busiest peak ever, delivering almost 500 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And UPS wrapped up the year with record EPS, free cash flow exceeding $5 billion and a new high in return on invested capital.", "In the U.S. we saw a robust growth in e-commerce, while traditional retailers experienced mixed holiday sales. Continued migration to B2C contributed significant growth in UPS' residential shipments. This rapidly expanding market segment enables more and more opportunities for consumers to experience the unique solutions provided by UPS. Solutions like UPS My Choice, the industry's first offering that puts receivers in control of their shipments. UPS delivered almost 3 million packages to My Choice users during the quarter. Enrollment exceeded expectations approaching 0.75 million subscribers, not bad for a service offering in its first 3 months of existence. All in all, the U.S. market performed very well, growing at a faster pace than we projected.", "Turning our focus to other parts of the world, in Europe, recession concerns, the debt crisis and the instability of the euro dominated headlines. But for UPS, solid growth continued. While in Asia, economic output and our volume lagged expectations. Looking to 2012, global economic expansion is expected to be slightly below the rate seen in 2011.", "The U.S. is one of the few economies where expectations are greater than last year. Some countries in Europe are expecting growth while others are facing contraction. And in Asia, although there's discussion about slowing, growth there is still projected to outpace the rest of the world.", "Businesses in Asia understand the power of global trade. And clearly, their economies benefit greatly. The U.S. needs to pick up the pace of exports and increase the participation of small and large companies alike. Recently, 3 key trade agreements were approved. These pave an excellent avenue for growth.", "Small and medium-sized businesses are currently underrepresented in global trade. UPS is actively engaged in enhancing the export process for them through our broad set of solutions, expertise of our people and the reach of our network, bringing it all together through the power of UPS technology.", "Companies throughout the world face many challenges today. In parts of China, supply chains are stressed by rapid wage inflation, while in other parts of the world volatile energy prices, natural disasters and social unrest provide additional strains. Companies also face more industry-specific challenges as they look to serve the global market. Take healthcare for example, where companies encounter increased regulations, greater competition from generics and a heightened focus on cost control.", "As a result, more businesses are trying to diversify the components of their supply chains. And they are looking for reliable outsourcing partners so that they can focus on their core competencies. As these shifts occur, the complexity of the logistics model increases. UPS is uniquely positioned to assist customers worldwide with their distribution and transportation needs as they evolve. This evolution will require further investments on our part to develop new innovative solutions, increase channel access to our global network and expand our unmatched logistics capabilities.", "We, at UPS were encouraged by comments made during the state of the union address that supported all of the above when it comes to alternative fuels. We have talked quite a bit in the past about our rolling laboratory approach; not just one alternative fuel solves our needs. Expanding the availability and the use of natural gas is one answer in improving the environment and reducing dependence on oil. ", "We were honored to be recognized recently by President Obama for our work in this area. But finding solutions that improve processes is what UPS-ers do every day. And for that reason, I want to thank UPS-ers around the world for their hard work and dedication in providing excellent service. Each of them impacts how UPS is perceived by our customers and communities. All in all, a job well done. ", "As I told you a year ago, 2011 was going to be a great year for UPS, and it was just that. We experienced solid top line growth in a challenging economic environment, continued gains in productivity, 20% improvement in operating profit, record EPS and on top of that, we had strong free cash flow, enabling UPS to continue our trend of significant distributions to our shareowners.", "Now let me turn the call over to Kurt.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning. Before I get started, I want to explain how I will discuss fourth quarter performance in light of the pension accounting change announced last Friday. To make comparisons to past trends easier, I will review our results as they would've been under the old methodology first. After covering all segments, I will bridge results to the new methodology and then guidance, of course, will reflect the impact of our new pension accounting.", "Now let's get started. A year ago, we announced that UPS expected to achieve record earnings per share in 2011. I am pleased to report today that we did just that, exceeding our previous peak earnings per share of $4.11, generating earnings per share of $4.23.", "Not only did we set a new high in earnings per share, UPS also achieved record revenue of $53.1 billion, up more than 7%, and we surpassed the $4 billion mark in consolidated package volume for the year. All of this was accomplished during a period of uneven global economic conditions.", "In the fourth quarter, revenue climbed 5.6% on average daily volume growth of 3.6%. Operating profit approached $2 billion, up 12.6% over last year. And operating margin improved to 14.0%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to 2010.", "Notice that the tax rate during the fourth quarter came in higher than expected at 35.3%. This was due to a greater portion of profitability in the U.S. than planned, as well as some year-end adjustments. For the full year, our tax rate was 34.3%. Despite this additional tax expense, earnings per share for the quarter were $1.25. These results are impressive considering the macro trends that Scott outlined.", "Overall, UPS had a fantastic peak season with global average daily volume exceeding 27 million packages on 2 days, and exceeding 25 million on 5. UPS technology provided customers and receivers visibility into their shipment as never before, handling almost 58 million tracking requests on peak day.", "Now let's review segment performance during the quarter starting with U.S. Domestic. The segment saw strong revenue growth of 7.3% on a 3.8% jump in average daily package volume. Our Deferred Air products rose 12%, while ground was up 3.5%. All products benefited from the surge in online shopping, as we experienced robust gains in B2C volume, especially in our suite of lightweight solutions.", "Revenue per piece was up 3.4%. Higher base rates and fuel surcharges were somewhat masked by a decline in weight per shipment and changes in both customer and product mix. Growth from large e-commerce customers outpaced smaller accounts, impacting both customer mix and package characteristics. As a result of this rapid growth in B2C, UPS experienced a meaningful decrease in weight per shipment, down almost 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.", "We successfully adapted to this changing product mix, with an operating profit increase of 24% and margin expansion of 200 basis points to 14.9%. The U.S. domestic operations executed one of their best peak seasons, demonstrating the benefits of scale, as well as the flexibility and efficiency of the UPS network. And of course, a little help from Mother Nature never hurts. Key operating statistics, like direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours, all grew at a slower pace than volume. ", "Moving to the International segment. Challenging economic conditions existed in many regions of the world. UPS export volume out of the U.S. declined, as the dollar strengthened against the euro. Meanwhile, UPS remained resilient in Europe and continued to produce solid results. And though our growth rate in export from Asia improved slightly compared to the third quarter, it was basically flat with last year and below expectations.", "These conditions and a nearly 2% unfavorable currency impact, contributed to the UPS revenue growth of 3.5%. UPS did set a new benchmark in export daily volume, surpassing 1 million packages. The increase of 4.5% was driven by high-single-digit gains from Europe, as well as strong intra-Asia and Asia to Europe trade. What makes this new high in export volume even more impressive is the fact that the Asia to U.S. lane was down by almost 3%.", "Non-U.S. domestic volumes were up a little over 1%, as strong growth from Poland, Turkey and France helped offset weaker demand in other markets. Operating profit declined $40 million to $497 million. The year-over-year comparison was negatively impacted by approximately $30 million, due to currency fluctuation and our hedging programs.", "Despite the challenging impact of changes in product mix and shifting trade patterns, UPS once again generated the highest operating margin in the industry, in line with our expectations of 15.8%. We experienced a shortening in trade lanes as a result of solid intra-regional shipment growth and weakness in the Asia to U.S. Lane.  International yield was up 2%, negatively impacted by a currency translation. Neutralizing this, it was up almost 4%. ", "Also, during the quarter, UPS made available several improvements for International shippers. These included enhanced return logistic solutions, as well as expanded availability of our customer-facing technology, including mobile apps.", "Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment. Operating profits increased 8.5% on revenue growth of a little over 2%. Operating margin expanded 50 basis points over last year to 8.2%. UPS Freight led the way with good operating profit improvement from gains in productivity and the solid increase in revenue. Though LTL shipments and tonnage were down 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively, revenue per hundredweight was up almost 9%, driven by revenue management initiatives and higher fuel surcharges.", "The Forwarding business unit experienced a decline in revenue and operating profit, as overcapacity and weak demand in the airfreight market put downward pressure on both tonnage and rates. Margins, however, remained strong.", "Our Distribution unit continues to be a success, exhibiting growth in both revenue and profitability, while expanding operating margins. This was accomplished even as the business continued to invest in its healthcare capabilities. In fact during the quarter, we opened the 33rd dedicated UPS healthcare facility and have plans to open 4 more this year. UPS also completed a healthcare acquisition during the quarter, purchasing the Italian pharma logistics provider, Pieffe. With these added capabilities, UPS is positioned to serve pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies doing business there.", "Moving on to review our cash position. During 2011, UPS generated more than $5 billion in free cash flow, after making capital expenditures of $2.0 billion and pension contributions of $1.4 billion.  In 2011, UPS increased its share repurchase program significantly and stepped up dividends. In fact, for the year, we repurchased 38.7 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid dividends totaling $2 billion, up 10.6% per share. This demonstrates UPS' continued commitment to distributions to shareowners.", "Before discussing our expectations for 2012, I want to take a few minutes to build a bridge to UPS' results under the new pension accounting methodology. This new method implemented in the fourth quarter 2011 is preferable and will result in simpler, more transparent financial reporting. It will be the foundation used for results from this point forward, and will be the basis for comparisons noted in guidance. Keep in mind, as Andy mentioned earlier, that historical financial statements reflecting both methods are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.", "So looking at the fourth quarter, the new methodology had a positive impact on adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.03. Earnings per share came in at $1.28 per share, an increase of 21% over prior year results, on a 17% improvement in operating profit. 2011 operating margin of 14.3%, increased 140 basis points over the 12.9% in 2010. And looking at our full year 2011 results, adopting this new methodology resulted in an increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.12.", "Total company earnings per share came in at $4.35 per share, an increase of 25% over prior year results on a 20% improvement in operating profits. And 2011 operating margin of 12.9% increased 140 basis points over the 11.5% in 2010. Remember, the pension accounting change we adopted has no impact on cash flow or plan funding. In fact, we ended the year 94% funded for UPS-sponsored pension plans. ", "Looking towards to 2012, even though we adopted this new method, we still project that ongoing pension expense will increase on a year-over-year basis by more than $100 million, due to additional service cost and an approximately 35-basis-point decline in the discount rate. Continuing with our outlook for 2012, recent economic news about slowing in Europe and Asia is in contrast to the more optimistic tone we are seeing here in the U.S. Our expectation is for mixed economic growth around the world, with modest improvements in the U.S. Overall, we expect global economic expansion to be slightly less than the growth rate seen in 2011.", "In spite of this macro outlook, UPS expects another strong year of earnings growth and we are anticipating earnings per share in the range of $4.75 to $5 per share, an increase of 9% to 15% over our 2011 earnings of $4.35.", "For the full year, U.S. Domestic segment average daily volume is projected to grow around 2% to 3%. Revenue is expected to be up mid-single digits. Base rate improvements of 2% to 3% are expected, although these may be masked somewhat by continued growth in lightweight solutions that serve the ever-expanding e-commerce market. Operating profit should grow at an upper single-digit pace, as we anticipate continued margin expansion.", "In our International business, we expect revenue to increase at a mid- to high-single digit rate on a 5% to 6% growth in export average daily volume.  Domestic volumes are projected to be similar to last year's levels. We expect operating profit growth of about 10% with some margin expansion.  The first quarter is expected to be flat to last year, due to more challenging comparisons and the current weakness in the euro. Although as the year progresses, we do not anticipate currency to have a meaningful impact on year-over-year results.", "For Supply Chain and Freight, the first half of 2012 comparisons will be more challenging, due to strong performance in freight forwarding last year. Given this, operating profit growth will most likely be flat to down slightly. For the full year, we expect both revenue and operating profit to increase at a mid- to high-single digit pace. Continued gains in UPS Freight will be somewhat offset by healthcare investments in the distribution unit. The Supply Chain and Freight segment overall is expected to maintain a strong operating margin of approximately 8%.", "Looking at total company results for the first quarter, due to the items highlighted in both International and Supply Chain and Freight, we expect year-over-year growth in earnings per share to be a little less than the average for the year.  Our overall tax rate for 2012 should be between 34% and 35%. We expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be approximately $2.2 billion. Regarding cash flow for 2012, UPS expects strong cash flow conversion to continue, exceeding 100% of net income. We remain committed to distributions to shareowners, with planned share repurchases of $2.7 million. And as always, dividends will continue to be a priority.", "So to wrap this up, 2011 was a record year for UPS as our business model generated outstanding results. The robust fourth quarter performance that we experienced gives us momentum as we move into 2012. We entered this year with the expectation of delivering strong earnings growth with earnings per share in the range of $4.75 to $5.00, up 9% to 15% compared to 2011 earnings of $4.35.", "Thanks for listening this morning. And now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color into the guidance as it relates to the pension impact and maybe shedding some light on that, I know that we have the $0.12 impact in 2011. What would have been the impact in 2012 if we were to normalize for the old pension accounting?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, we would've seen, certainly, an increase in pension expense for 2012 under both methodologies. And as I mentioned, we do expect more than $100 million, actually about $115 million, in additional pension expense for 2012. But I guess one thing to keep in mind, that the increase is, perhaps not necessarily as drastic as many of you projected, really due to 2 facts. Number one, the plan did exceed its expected rate of return. We actually generated a 9.4% return. And the discount rate did decline by about 35 basis points and certainly there were some estimates that estimated higher. And as far as the 2 methods, going forward, in some years, the old method results in more expense and in some, it results in less. You could see that in 2010 and 2011. So you saw this in our restated results were we've shown those results. So the best reference point, really, is from the base that we've restated 2011. We do expect to see about $115 million increase in pension expense, and you could adjust accordingly based on that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give a bit more perspective on how much of the volume improvement was, really, just a very strong peak season and your, obviously, good traction with your products to serve online, those shipping online sales. And how much is, I guess, either a change in your share performance or a change in the economy? Because it's a pretty notable difference in your Domestic Package volumes versus kind of flat in the third quarter. And your guidance in 2012 also implies, I think, a better volume trajectory than you saw in 2011. So I wonder if you could give more color on that.", "D. Scott Davis", "Let me start, Tom, with kind of the macro approach. I think that we certainly are seeing a better U.S. economy than we would have thought back in, probably August, September, back at Investor Conference time. I think that, back to that time frame, people were talking about a chance for a second recession. You don't hear that anymore. Clearly, we saw a strengthening economy and a strong holiday season. And frankly, it stayed fairly strong into January. So I think the U.S., while I wouldn't call it a robust economy right now, I do think the small package market is performing better than we would've thought 4 and 5 months ago.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. That's right. So at a macro level, clearly, we feel a little better about where the U.S. is at. Looking more specifically, I guess, to your question, Tom, we clearly were pleasantly surprised by the demand surrounding the holiday season. Really, this is the first peak where we've really had our full suite of lightweight product offerings in place. And about half of the additional growth we do, we did see in our basic and SurePost products. If you recall, SurePost really was just launched in 2011. So we did see a big uptick and clearly, this fits into the trend of lighter-weight products, computers moved to tablets or portables and a lot of small products. And then the e-commerce growth continues unabated. We estimate, in general, e-commerce was probably up about 15% for the holiday season. So basically, we were in place with a new suite of products that was able to both attract volume and at the same time, handle it very profitably. So we were pleasantly surprised, frankly. I think, that combined with the increased focus we've had on B2C with My Choice and really differentiating our residential products, created a nice uptick. We also saw, the other number that might have surprised you a little bit, was the substantial growth in deferred air. And a lot of this is also surrounding the e-commerce trends, I guess, that there were a number of Internet retailers that decided to differentiate their products by offering a tighter Time-In-Transit. So we're seeing some pieces moving around. But all in all, we were thrilled that our business model and our product offerings were able to generate a great quarter.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Do you think there's a difference in share dynamic or competitive dynamic, is that part of this as well?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I wouldn't comment on that. I think, in general, it was a good holiday season. The market moved pretty well. So we'll see how everything else settles out.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the B2C trends, obviously, quite strong in the quarter. So it sounds like, deferred strength was driven partially there. But you also talked about a mix shift that's occurring. So maybe you could put some numbers around the growth in B2C that you saw in your business this year versus last year, some expectations going forward. And then, maybe help us think about why that weight per shipment is lower and how that affects mix from a yield standpoint?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. As I guess a ballpark number, I think there's a couple of parts to it. Number one, B2C is growing robustly, especially through the e-commerce venue. Clearly, the e-commerce branches of companies seemed to do a lot better than the brick and mortar. In fact, in December, B2C volume was over 50% of our volume. December, it always spikes. So we are continuing to see that grow. The other nuance, and this is more company specific, is the substantial success of our SurePost product, which for the first time has offered a broader suite of services for lightweight products, lower values. So that was another big part of the success. So the combination of the trends in general, UPS positioning and us being able to differentiate. And as we mentioned, sign up 0.75 million customers for the new My Choice service, we think really puts us in a great position to capture some of the benefit of these trends.", "D. Scott Davis", "And Justin, I think you'll also see these trends internationally; it's not going to be unique to the United States. I think the whole global B2C phenomenon is still in the early innings and we'll see that grow going forward. But the key is that UPS is adapting the operations to be profitable in this business.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Can you guys just remind us, SurePost, that\u2019s the competitive product with SmartPost on your primary competitor side?", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes. SurePost is for lightweight, relatively low-value products where we do postal injection. We also, though, have a basic product that's a mix of both UPS delivered and injection.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. [Operator Instruction]", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you talk on the International side, you talked about the slowing of growth or the expectations for a bit slower, particularly out of Asia. When you think about your CapEx, I guess, you talked about increasing it 10%, is that -- can you talk about what you're doing in terms of are you slowing down or shutting down any lanes and where are you increasing that CapEx?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, we did certainly make some adjustments in the network after the fairly significant slowing we saw during the third quarter. And as we said, the Asia ended up being a little slower than we'd anticipated, most notably on the U.S., Asia to U.S. lane. Yes, we have tweaked our network. Actually, if you look at Asia, specifically, we reduced capacity about 10% over the last couple of quarters maintaining service levels in all markets, but some of the duplicate flights and additional lift we took out. And that allowed us to sustain still a pretty good margin, although we will continue to adjust. Trends so far for this year are a little hard to tell because the Chinese New Year is coming a little earlier. But we'll stay responsive in monitoring where things are at in Asia. On the flip side though, Ken, we did see yet another quarter of solid intra-Europe growth. So in spite of the headline risks in Europe, we are continuing to see good growth there and some of our investments for next year surround the expansion of our Cologne air hub in Germany, that helps to support all that.", "D. Scott Davis", "And in general, Ken, our CapEx is still historically quite low. It's going to be still around 4% of revenue. If you recall, we used to spend between 5% and 8% of revenue. So we've had, really, a 3 low years. I mean 2009 was extremely really low, 2010 was low and 2011, what, 3.8%, I think 2011, and about 4% for 2012. So still, it\u2019s still quite low.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "On the Supply Chain and Freight side of things, you mentioned that you saw a decline in revenue and operating profit due to mainly overcapacity and weak demand in the air freight market, but that margins were strong. Did margins actually expand year-over-year for the Freight Forwarding segment?  And also, if you could comment on ocean and what you're seeing on the ocean side of things?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Margins expanded slightly year-over-year. But yes, there's clearly been a reduction in demand, not surprisingly, and rates. And there is certainly some challenges with margin squeeze. Ocean, we did pretty well on, although I think, clearly, the market remains very slow. But we've done a lot of work on our expanded ocean portfolio less than container load. But it remains a minority part of the business, air freight is the primary focus.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Wanted to talk a little bit about the disconnect that I'm kind of picking up on a little bit between the very strong U.S. e-commerce activity through the different channels, coupled with the kind of slower import growth in terms of wondering where, in terms of the shift in production, a lot of those e-commerce products then might be coming from or how the supply chains are moving?", "D. Scott Davis", "I think, in general, it's been all about inventory levels. And I think that we did not, even though inventory seemed to add to GDP in the fourth quarter, we feel that most of the inventories are still pretty slight in the United States. I think we saw the holiday season, a lot of people are running out of product. We have seen a pretty strong January. I think those people had to replenish inventory levels. So I think that, that because of low imports from Asia you're going to, hopefully, see some improvements in the near term as people replenish the inventory levels.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I think we are fairly bullish though on production within the U.S. seeing somewhat a renaissance. If you look at the cost of energy with natural gas so low, you look at the fact that wages on a global competitive perspective have improved in the U.S. And the fact that people are realizing that it's nice to have local sourcing in addition to global sourcing. We feel generally bullish that the U.S. economy is seeing a bit of an uplift and will next year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on kind of the intra-European volume flows during the quarter, and maybe what you're seeing in the first month of this year?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. As I said, Europe continues to be a good story. And I think it's really 2 components. One, is the UPS-specific success in offering European shippers an integrated solution. And the other is I think the, and we heard some of this from Davos, that the core business activity is probably a little better than the headlines would suggest. So I think, we did see upper single-digit growth in shipments within Europe, that is a little slower than some of the previous quarters, but reports of Europe's demise have been exaggerated a bit.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, we really are -- have built our plan on a pretty flat economy, probably slightly negative European economy in 2012. But again, that small package market should grow even in that environment.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I hate to ask you this one, but it's polluting my inbox right now. Could you just clarify, Kurt, you said when you were giving your outlook, I thought what I heard you say was flat international profit and that EPS at the corporate level, you were thinking was going to be lower growth in the earlier part of the year than in the back half. I think some people might have heard that it was flat EPS with, I think it's $0.88 last year. Could you just clarify? Could you just go back over that and clarify exactly what you were trying to communicate there, please?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Great. I'm glad you asked that if it was confusing, because that was not the intention. We had said that the first quarter for international is likely to be flat, really, because of some of the trends we've talked about, plus we do have a pretty strong euro headwind in the first quarter. We're currently hedged and protected at about 1.30; last year, it was at about 1.36, so that was purely a quarterly guidance. Overall, for the company, we expect earnings increases in the first quarter. They'll just be probably a little less than the average that we guided for, for the year. We guided a 9% to 15% range. So that was solely a comment about the first quarter, Gary.", "D. Scott Davis", "And the currency drag, Gary, is euro is primarily in the first quarter, our hedging program will protect us pretty well from Q2, 3 and 4.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Morgan Keegan.", "Arthur W. Hatfield - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on that. To make sure we understand your guidance correct there, Kurt, what numbers are you using, the quarter numbers for the year and for the full year?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, overall, we're guiding to a 9% to 15% increase, $4.75 to $5.00 a share. We've said, in general, we expect Q1 to be a little more challenged. So it'll show earnings growth but at a little lower rate than the rest of the year, primarily because of the headwind in international. And also the comps in supply chain are tough, given the current margin squeeze.", "D. Scott Davis", "So remember, Art, we guide annually to help you a little bit on the quarterly, but we guide annually.", "Arthur W. Hatfield - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "No, that's helpful. I was just curious which base you were using.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "No, all bases are against the restated. We're moving past the old numbers. I wanted to review and give you some sense since you'd anchored on those for Q4. But we have a base earnings of $4.35, that is the methodology. And all the guidance is based off of that base. And as I said, we do have a pension headwind heading into next year. But virtually, everything that we talk about and you see from now on will be based on this improved, more transparent approach. And we feel good about the year, but we do feel Q1 will be just a little more challenging.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. William Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Kurt, can we just come back to the impact from the changes on the pension accounting. Will that affect any of the long-term guidance that you gave us back in September? Did those numbers get affected? I assume there is some impact, but how would we think about that impact?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Bill, they really don't. When we restated, 3 of the years went one way, and 2 of the years went the other. So if you paint me a scenario of different discount rates and market returns, yes, it may be different. But as we've looked at it, it's not a material change over the longer term for margins or any of that. Well, it may make the results slightly different year-over-year. So we went back and looked at that, and we really don't see a scenario. If discount rates rise and markets do well, this method is a drag, because we are not going to take credit for those market returns on our quarter results. Conversely, if we stay with these incredibly low discount rates with 10-year treasuries under 2%, then we -- this method may pull some of that, those investment losses or at least the discount rate impact out of core earnings. But long term, our guidance that we gave in September remain. Probably, the only notable difference in guidance is we are actually a little more optimistic on 2012. If you remember, we gave guidance of 10% to 15% to earnings in September, but said that 2012 would be more challenging because we believe there would be below-trend growth in the global economy. But we do think it's going to be below-trend growth but clearly, we're giving earnings guidance very close to that long-term momentum.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Question on the international cargo revenue that's booked within the International Package segment. That number is sort of lower than it's been since the recession and I was wondering how much of that decline is due to less space on the brownfield aircraft for cargo revenue or just very weak rates for the filler freight you are taking on?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "It's a little bit of all of those. A, we did reduce capacity out of Asia, so we had less excess capacity to use. Rates have also softened a little bit. Plus some of that space is used by our forwarder and would not show up in that cargo line.", "D. Scott Davis", "But clearly, the excess capacity has driven down rates and that\u2019s going to have an impact on the revenue.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I have a question on the pension. What's driving the increase in service cost? Did you change benefits? And also, what is your plan for cash contributions? Are you putting anything in the plan in '12?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. Service cost is just going to be up as kind of a normal continued growth. Each of us clicks another year on the pension, I guess. The biggest impact is the lower discount rate. And as far as contributions, we expect to make about $400 million of direct contributions to the pension plans, and another $400 million or so to cover our post-employment benefits retiree, medical and some of those things.", "D. Scott Davis", "And everybody is living a little bit longer, so mortality tables have an impact on it also.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "If we got the model together fast enough before the call, it looked like deferred air yields in the U.S. Package business were up 2.5% year-over-year in 4Q, which was kind of a notable step down from the 9.8% in 3Q. And again, assuming we got the model together is fast enough, is there any kind of trade down that's happening in that business or is there anything else that may be impacting the yields there?", "D. Scott Davis", "On deferred air, it's really trade up, if anything, from ground. The big issue there is the weights are significantly lower. That was the product hit most significantly by reductions in weight. So a lot of e-commerce volume with lightweight volume being shipped. So we're very conscious of it, the base rates underlying, as we said, remains strong 2% to 3%. But a 4% reduction in weight for deferred air, clearly, caused a big impact.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then a brief follow-up and I'm done. Any conversations around Brent? Oil prices these days, north of $100 here for a couple of months. Is that starting to creep up again and shift our conversations?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Really not. Over the last several years, we have migrated gradually some of the new normal for fuel into base rates. So the absolute amount of the surcharge is lower than it was in historical. And our plan for the year assumes fuel somewhere plus or minus near the $100 rate anyway.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So wanted to talk a little bit about the pricing guidance. I think you mentioned 2% to 3% pricing in the U.S. And I know that's in line with the longer-term expectations, but seems like a step down from what we got in 2011. And wanted to understand kind of the drivers of that, is this just being conservative or is there something changing in the pricing market that's not letting you get in '12 what you got in '11?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "No. We think the core momentum as I was -- certainly, something we've been looking at very closely. The core base rates are continuing very stable. We did see in Q4 significant impact of customer mix with our lightweight product suite, really kicking into gear. And we do expect that momentum to continue for a while. So the overall reduced weights, 3% in Q4, and that trend may continue given the customers and the e-commerce that we're seeing. It does create a net impact that shows lower yield. But as you can see, we are able to profit on that. So all in all, we think the market pricing is stable, it remains a very high priority for us. You're just really seeing a fairly significant market change and also a significant change in mix to UPS as we've really hit our stride with this light rate e-commerce volume.", "D. Scott Davis", "As Kurt said, the market is rational from a pricing standpoint. What can help us obviously is, Kurt referred earlier to the manufacturing increase in the U.S. If we see that throughout 2012, that certainly can help the weight and help the yield.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Yes. Well, I guess, I mean, I understand the negative mix impact from lower weight. I guess, I would've thought, though, with an improving macro outlook that there could have been an opportunity for better than 2% to 3% underlying pricing, and just trying to understand the drivers of that if it's just being conservative or what?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "It's consistent with what we talked about in September. Our long-term goal is to, in the domestic environment, is to generate 2% to 3% base rate increases. As long as we can keep yields moving at that rate and be able to keep our unit cost below that rate, we'll see gradual and positive margin expansion. So Scott, we think that's a very disciplined and appropriate approach. It maintains a stable relationship with our customers and we're very pleased if we can continue that positive balance of yield and unit cost.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I just want to clarify. You said going forward you were looking for about $400 million direct contribution of the planned $400 million postretirement benefit contributions. So $800 million versus the $1.4 billion I think that you talked about making last year. In terms of longer-term modeling, we should think of the $800 million as a base plus or minus being outside the corridor with your 94% funding?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "It's hard to forecast perfectly, but that's probably more normal. Clearly, we were catching up and fully funding the new plan that we had over the last year or 2. And frankly, that's one of the good news stories on our cash flow long term. Scott mentioned that CapEx should remain at or below 4%. The pensions are, even after what has been a tough year because of lower discount rates, we\u2019re 94% funded. So yes, the pension plans will not be a major hit on cash flow for the foreseeable future.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes. Even from a tax formula standpoint, we're actually over 100%, and that really was what drive your contributions going forward. So we feel good. Now we would have said a year ago that interest rates wouldn't have dropped. So I wouldn\u2019t expect them to drop going forward long- term rates, which could have an impact. They go up, that improves our funding position.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Robert Pickels of Manning & Napier.", "Robert F. Pickels - Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC", "Hope it's not a repeat, I think it's a little different from Tom Wadewitz's question. But I'm just wondering how all of this growth in e-commerce is changing the seasonal nature of your business. It seems like the e-retail might make 4Q even stronger than some of the other quarters on a go-forward basis. And I'm just wondering how you manage this. Is it significantly different? Do you have to take capacity up and down more than you used to? Just comment on that, please.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. Robert, you're absolutely right. And we've done a lot of work studying this. If you look at the seasonal factors of how different quarters and different seasons compare to themselves, we are really seeing that the fourth quarter become more and more important. And really 2 issues, I guess, number one, the demand for the fourth quarter has really created almost 2 peaks. We were extremely busy after the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period, that was a peak. Settled down and then, certainly, the last week of the holidays was another peak. The one piece of great news and this is reflected in our earnings results, is that the big challenge for us in the past of a large peak was tremendous amounts of training, a lot of disruption in our operations. As you guys saw in our investor conference, we have done a tremendous amount of work to, through operational technology to streamline our jobs, to deskill, so we don't have to train as much, and to optimize in real time. So what you really saw in the fourth quarter was a great demonstration of operational performance, driven by data-driven operations. And so the good news is we can handle these peaks and this growth in e-commerce very productively.", "D. Scott Davis", "And in fact, in the fourth quarter, our productivity improvements offset the entire wage rate increase. Now you'll see that because of the large scale in the fourth quarter, you won't see that necessarily in Q1, 2 and 3. But it does come through in a large-scale period like the fourth quarter.", "Robert F. Pickels - Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC", "Does it make it harder for the -- is it possible the fourth quarter is less indicative of broader economic trends because of the e-commerce?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. I think that's a valid point. I mean, if you look at overall retail, it was a little better perhaps than expected but not hugely. With our bias with the e-commerce hitting our industry more heavily, you do get a little bit of an outsized gain.", "D. Scott Davis", "But it's still tied somewhat to consumer sentiment. And if consumer sentiment is negative, you're going to get impact in of the fourth quarter or the first quarter.

Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a quick question on International. Kurt, I heard your commentary around you're reducing flights and that type of thing out of Asia, took out some of the duplicate type of businesses. But I'm kind of curious, it looked like the incremental margins domestically were very strong, some degradation on the international side. Is there anything else you can do to manipulate that cost structure to maybe get the incremental margins positive again on international? Or is it just a matter of kind of letting that [indiscernible]?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Absolutely not. I mean, you know us, John. We're working very hard to make sure that we've optimized the network, that our cost infrastructure is appropriate. As we did mention, we had about a $40 million decline in profits, $30 million of that was purely due to the euro hedge comparison. We'll face a little bit of that in Q1 but after that, as Scott had mentioned, our hedges put us in very good shape. So if you factor out that currency issue, we came pretty close to holding profits even in an environment where trade flows are changing substantially. So we're going to stay on our toes, make sure we've got the right assets in the right place and that our productivity and efficiencies cover it. One of the big trends that we're working on is taking some of the operational technology that we showcase that's used primarily for domestic and beginning to migrate that over to our international environment. So there's still more to come.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Company.", "David P.

Scott Davis", "Well, I think, David, that yes, with certainly Asia exports to Europe and the U.S. have not been that strong for -- really, for us it started in August, we saw the fall off. But intra-Asia has stayed strong. Certainly, as time goes on and consumer optimism keeps improving in the U.S. that will help demand, help imports from Asia into the U.S. We're guarded right now. We think there's some room for improvement, but we're just pretty guarded as far as what we see in 2012.

I'm wondering is this handled in existing sort facilities?  Is the order of magnitude below a percentage point of ground volume and I imagine ground margins -- or margins, are slightly lower in SurePost than they are in your own network?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. The concept of unique SurePost facilities is a misnomer. This is another product in the UPS suite portfolio. Virtually all of the SurePost volume comes to us from customers that give us multiple times volume in our traditional networks. So really the only difference with SurePost is the last final mile of lightweight volume going to the post office. But the pickup process, all of our sortation and our feed networks, that really remains in the UPS network. So it's traditional UPS taking advantages of the economies of scale and integrating it. So it is just one product in the suite of products that our customers choose from.

And the Mexico trend does seem to be an interesting one. It's hard to call it a groundswell but clearly, in our supply chain discussions with companies, there is a lot of discussion about should the next unit of capacity be closer to home. It's not necessarily that people are shutting down operations in any area, but there is a lot of interest. I think if you look over the last year or 2, whether it's floods or earthquakes, supply chains are very extended and can be fragile, as Scott mentioned. And so we do see a lot of interest in near sourcing.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes. We saw it peak in 2008, when oil got to $145 a barrel. So if oil and energy prices were to peak again, we'd certainly expect to see more of that.", "Operator", "Our next question will be a follow-up from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to get your comments on cost inflation and productivity within the domestic network in 2012, I don\u2019t think I've heard much of that on the call. And given that you expect positive volumes, could you see your seniority begin to come down and kind of how would you view the per hour inflation when you look at the labor side in Domestic Package in 2012?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. Tom, we do expect those trends. Certainly as the business grows and we're able to add new employees or see turnover as people find full-time jobs that are part-timers today, we will see some benefit. And our wage rates mitigated and moderated just a touch in the fourth quarter. It wasn't a huge driver but it was a slight positive. We do expect to keep comp and benefits somewhere between 1% and 2% increases year-over-year as opposed to volume. So as long as we're able to do that and at the same time manage the yield environments above that, then we're pretty confident we can manage margin expansion.", "D. Scott Davis", "Again, we are confident that our product [indiscernible] will offset probably half of the wage rate increase, which is consistent with what we've been doing.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted go back to the conversation about the tax rate and understanding that it came in lower than you expected because of the international profitability. What was it -- obviously, you adapted during the quarter, you tried to reduce capacity to combat some of the international weakness. It sounds like that didn't have quite the offsetting impact that you were expecting. Can you elaborate a little bit on that and then just help us think about of how you think that will play into the New Year and how things will improve during 2012?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, Gary, sure. Yes, the impact of our year-ending tax adjustment did reduce earnings by about $0.03 versus what we had guided to. As we said, one of the primary areas is, as we rolled up our profits from around the world in the 200 countries we operate, certainly, the lower international profits are taxed at a lower rate. Plus, the U.S. had a very strong quarter. So the U.S. rate's just about the highest in the world, so you've got a weighted average mix that drove our rate up and did impact profits by $0.03 or $0.04 a share or so. It's just part of the normal mix of business. Clearly, we're doing a lot of work to improve the international. We do expect to see profits up, approximately 10% next year. So we still feel great about the International business, but the tax accounting can be challenging when you've got dramatic changes in mix.", "D. Scott Davis", "And always, in the fourth quarter, Gary, we true up to returns we've filed from the prior year also, which results in some adjustments. And unfortunately, this fourth quarter, they went the wrong way.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Morgan Keegan.", "Arthur W. Hatfield - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I'm sorry. My follow-up has been answered.", "Operator", "And due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. William Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "If you look at what you did on rates in 2011, I think they were basically in line with your guidance sort of in this 2% to 3% range. But I think it also, correct me if I'm wrong, I think it benefited from some unique changes, things like dim weight, if I remember correctly or maybe I don't. So can you just clarify sort of are there any unique attributes to the rate changes for 2012 that we need to keep in mind when modeling?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "There's always moving -- multiple moving parts within the rate structure, Bill. I mean dim weight was a visible one, but it wasn't material outside the scope of normal adjustments we do for rates. So we expect a fairly typical rate environment for the coming year. We did announce our rates for both air and ground last quarter, and do expect base rates to remain in the 2% to 3% level. The guidance, really, is just that with this changing mix and the influx of lighter weight e-commerce packages that's coming in at a greater-than-expected rate, the top-level rate may look a little lower than that. But if you get to the bottom of it, the core rates will remain strong.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes. The yields, you mean, right?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Right.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the floor back over to your facilitator, Mr. Andy Dolny.", "Andy Dolny", "Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Scott for some final comments.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy. We finished 2011 on a strong note with an exceptional peak season. UPS produced strong Domestic Package margins in the fourth quarter. In the period we've talked about where e-commerce and B2C dominated our growth, we've been able to adapt and we'll continue to adapt our business to meet the demands of the marketplace. As Kurt said, despite a mixed economic outlook for 2012, we expect earnings growth to be in line with our long-term targets. We look forward to another record year.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations' Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning. Today, I'm joined by Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and future expectations.", "Before they begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2011 Form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "In the second quarter of last year, UPS reported a net gain of a $33 million as a result of 2 nonrecurring real estate transactions. These adjustments resulted in an after-tax benefit of $0.02 per share. In Scott and Kurt's comments today, references to 2011 results will exclude the impact of this gain. We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance.", "Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the Financials section. As a reminder, any guidance that we provide will not include the results of TNT operations, nor any synergies or post-closing integration expense associated with the acquisition.", "As always, today's call is being webcast and is also available on the UPS Investor Relations website. [Operator Instructions] I thank you in advance for your cooperation.", "Now let me turn it over to Scott.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy, and good morning. UPS's second quarter results were driven by the performance of our U.S. Domestic segment. We continue to benefit from the efficiency of our streamlined and integrated network. Our unique portfolio of solutions has allowed UPS to adapt quickly to the evolving needs of e-commerce shippers and do it profitably. On the other hand, our International segment results continue to be impacted by declines in exports from both Asia and the U.S.", "Economies around the world are showing signs of weakening, and our customers are increasingly nervous. In the U.S., uncertainty, stemming from this year's elections and the looming fiscal cliff, constrains the ability of businesses to make important decisions, such as hiring new employees, making capital investments and restocking inventories. This will further restrict economic growth.", "In fact, this is already evident as June's manufacturing ISM and growth in retail sales numbers were the worst we've seen since 2009. In addition, employment gains have started to slow down, all of which had a negative impact on commercial volume growth. Given these trends, we think current second half economic forecasts for the U.S. are too high and that GDP growth will likely be closer to 1%.", "In Europe, the debt crisis lingers on as more countries struggle with austerity measures that are pushing them into recession. Despite this, UPS export volume has continued to grow, although at reduced rates. While economies in Asia are still expanding, expectations have come down in the last 3 months.", "Overall, GDP forecasts around the world are declining. Historically, global exports grow at a higher rate than GDP. This is not the case today. In fact, global trade is lagging GDP. This has only occurred once in the past 10 years, and that was during the last recession. We believe this is temporary and that as GDP growth begins to accelerate, a more typical relationship between the 2 will exist.", "Though the macro environment gives us concern, we have confidence in our strategy and remain focused on current objectives. One strategy, demonstrating the power of logistics, will be on display during the 2012 London Olympic Games. As the official logistics express delivery supporter, UPS is responsible for the staging the largest peacetime logistical undertaking in the world, providing the warehousing, distribution and logistics to produce the games while delivering 30 million items, everything from tennis balls to goal posts. UPS is eager to demonstrate the industry's most advanced supply-chain capabilities at this year's games and further strengthen our brand in Europe.", "Now for an update on our offer to acquire TNT Express. This transaction will diversify our global revenue, increase our portfolio of solutions and expand our geographic footprint. The complementary strengths of both companies will create a customer-focused platform, delivering unparalleled access to the world, while at the same time, enhancing shareholder value.", "During the quarter, UPS made significant progress towards completing the purchase, including the announcement of our financing plan and the publishing of the Offer Memorandum. Over a week ago, UPS announced that the review process with the European Commission will move to Phase 2 as there are certain areas that require more time to analyze. We expect to close the transaction during the fourth quarter.", "Another recent development I am pleased to note is that UPS and the Teamsters have agreed to get an early start to negotiations. Formal talks are expected to begin soon.", "This brings me to my final point. As 2012 continues to progress, keep this in mind: During our 105-year history, UPS has dealt with many different economic conditions and changing marketplaces. And through it all, we have proven our founder, Jim Casey, right. Determined UPSers around the world working together can accomplish anything. I assure you, we'll make the necessary changes to adapt and respond to the current challenges as we've done so many times in the past.", "Now Kurt will review our results for the quarter.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning. The second quarter results released this morning, which produced earnings per share growth of 7.5%, are solid, considering the change of pace in the global economic environment that Scott alluded to earlier. On a consolidated basis, UPS daily volume improved 2.7%, and operating profit was up 4.6%, with 40 basis points of margin expansion. This points to the flexibility of our product portfolio and the efficiency of the UPS network. We provided UPS customers with solutions needed in this challenging economic climate, and we're able to generate the industry's best margins.", "Let's take a look at how the segments performed, starting with U.S. Domestic. E-commerce in the U.S. continues to expand, benefiting the segment. Operating profit growth was up over 12% with margin expansion of 100 basis points. Strong operating leverage resulted from the volume growth, base rate increases and continued network efficiencies. I also want to point out that the quarter did benefit by over $60 million from the fuel surcharge lag.", "Daily volume was up 3.5%, driven entirely by B2C. One concern of note was the lower manufacturing ISM numbers that point to lower purchasing activity. This is contributing to a deceleration in our critical business-to-business volume growth.", "Air products outpaced ground during the quarter with Next Day Air volume up 5% while deferred increased by 8.6%, driven by growth in our Saver and the residential shipments. UPS experienced gains in Next Day Air letters again during this quarter, reversing a long trend of declines.", "Ground package volume was up 3%. Over 1/2 of this growth was attributable to a 25% increase in lightweight products. Revenue improved a little over 4%. As expected, average revenue per package was up less than 1%.", "Yields across all products benefited from base pricing but were offset by faster growth from large customers and changes in product mix. We continue to see rapid growth in lightweight and Saver products, both of which have lower yields. Although they do have lower yields, this volume continues to contribute to our productivity gains.", "Average daily volume was 3.5% higher, while miles driven and direct labor hours were up only about 1%, and block hours actually declined. Savings in direct payroll costs were not enough, however, to overcome growth in benefit expense. Health care jumped over 7%, while pension-related expenses were up more than 10%.", "Overall, a good quarter in the U.S. Domestic, aided somewhat by the fuel surcharge lag. Importantly, current trends, such as the lack of B2B growth, are concerning going forward. But we are taking the necessary steps, implementing both revenue and cost initiatives, as well as making adjustments to the UPS network.", "Now for a review of our International results. Slowing global economies, shifting trade patterns and negative currency translation resulted in a 4% revenue contraction. Double-digit declines in high-yielding shipments from Asia to both Europe and the U.S. produced a notable drop in profitability. That's not surprising considering the infrastructure required to support Asia. We made adjustments to our network during the first half of the year and are implementing additional cuts to mitigate this trend.", "Operating profit in the International was down $51 million from last year. Expenses related to M&A activity accounted for a drag of about $15 million. However, our margin is still the industry's best at 15.1%. In contrast to the significant decline in transcontinental demand, intra-regional shipments continue to increase. Overall export volume was up by 1%, as growth in Europe was mostly offset by the declines in Asia that I mentioned.", "When faced with today's economic challenges, customers continue to trade down to less costly alternatives. As a result, we experienced faster growth in our transborder standard products and even saw some trade-down from small package into freight.", "Non-U.S. Domestic volume was down 3.2%, reflecting yield improvement initiatives in Germany and Turkey. Fiscal austerity measures in Southern Europe contributed to double-digit declines there. But keep in mind that although this is a fairly steep drop in volume, it had only a small impact on segment profitability.", "Export revenue per piece was down 3.5%, the primary factor being the year-over-year currency fluctuations. In fact, currency-neutral revenue per piece was flat, reflecting base rate increases that were offset by changes in trade lanes and product mix.", "So it's been a challenging environment for our International group over the last 12 months. But during this time, we've implemented various revenue and cost initiatives, including reductions to our network, and we will continue to do so as we are planning another 10% reduction in our Asian air network. This will position us better for the future.", "And now for the Supply Chain & Freight segment. Operating profit increased by 3.6%, and margin expanded 50 basis points to 8.9%, the highest margin this segment has seen. Revenue declined 1.6% due to slowing international airfreight demand. Although the forwarding units saw an increase in tonnage, revenue was down as rate per kilo continues to be challenged in the key Asia outbound market. Operating margin was still strong due to effective revenue management and cost controls.", "In UPS Freight, revenue growth was flat as improvements in LTL pricing were offset by a decline in shipments. Operating profit and margin increased during the quarter due to productivity gains. Revenue in our Distribution business was higher, primarily from continued growth in health care and UPS lightweight solutions. Investments in technology and infrastructure to support the company's health care initiative did impact operating profit.", "Looking now at cash and our balance sheet. For the 6 months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.0 billion in free cash flow, up more than $600 million. Capital expenditures were $949 million, which included the delivery of 6 767s.", "So far this year, UPS has paid dividends totaling $1.1 billion, representing a 9.5% increase per share. In addition, we've repurchased 11.3 million shares for approximately $870 million. Regarding share repurchases, we are on track to spend $1.5 billion in 2012, and outstanding share count in the third quarter will be similar to the second. As we prepare to complete the TNT transaction, you will notice that our cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet have reached over $7 billion.", "Regarding guidance, the macro environment that we expect in the second half of 2012 calls for slower growth than originally anticipated when we set our initial guidance range back in January. Given this, we now expect 2012 diluted earnings per share of between $4.50 and $4.70. This represents a 3% to 8% increase over 2011.", "I do want to take a couple of minutes to provide more insight into the segments, starting with the U.S. Domestic where we see some concerning trends. Average daily volume growth is expected to moderate, reflecting the macro environment. We anticipate some deceleration in premium product growth, and B2B volume is expected to deteriorate further with pretty much all of our growth coming from B2C. As a result, revenue will increase between 1% and 2%.", "On a year-over-year basis, comp and benefit expense will be about 1% higher in the second half than what we saw in the first. This is primarily a result of increases in health care costs. The combination of the mix changes and the higher benefit costs will result in operating margin being slightly above what we saw in the first half of the year, but it's still less than last year.", "Turning now to International, where daily export volume is expected to grow at a slightly faster pace than what we saw in the first half of the year. This is not indicative of economic expansion but is more a result of beginning to lap last year's slowdown in Asia. As previously mentioned, we have taken the necessary actions like air network capacity cuts and implementing in-country cost controls. And as a result, we anticipate operating profit to grow at a mid to high single-digit pace with more growth in the fourth quarter. Operating margin in the third quarter should be slightly below last year, while the fourth quarter margin will expand on a year-over-year basis.", "Regarding Supply Chain & Freight, we expect mid-single-digit revenue gains, and operating profit growth will be in the mid-teens with margins reaching 9%.", "For a little more detail on the earnings per share for the second half of the year, we anticipate that in the third quarter, they will be below last year. Let me remind you that in 3Q '11, we recorded a 32.9% tax rate that added about $0.03 per share. Fourth quarter earnings should show solid improvements.", "To wrap things up, our first half results have been respectable, with the U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain & Freight segments performing well. However, we are seeing indications of a weakening global economy, creating challenges for companies in the quarters ahead. Of course, we at UPS are prepared to make the right moves in any economic environment to ensure the company's long-term success. UPSers around the world are working diligently to make the necessary changes to our network while providing the service excellence that UPS customers have come to expect.", "Thanks for listening this morning, and now Scott and I will be happy to answer your question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I had wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on the time lag that you would typically experience in terms of taking out cost and adjusting to some of the changes in volume. So if you could comment both on the time lag in your International operations, where I would think things are a little more fixed, and then the time lag with respect to cost takeout in Domestic.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. Great, Tom. I think you're right on target with that. As you know, we've been wrestling and working through the International trends for the last couple of quarters. Frankly, the velocity of the declines, being double digits in Asia both to Europe and U.S., were a little higher than we anticipated, but we have been in the process of making network changes and expect another 10% to come out during the next quarter. So we feel like we've pretty much caught up to the changes in International, and that's why we're actually guiding for profit improvements in the second half of the year. The weakening environment in the U.S. and, most notably, with the B2C trends is a little more recent. Frankly, we began to see that get more notable in the second quarter. So we're a little bit behind as far as the time schedule on that. And so there is probably a quarter, maybe 2-quarter lag for us, really, to fully implement the changes, and that's really the top priority right now.", "D. Scott Davis", "Now, Tom, clearly, on the Domestic side, the direct labor hours, we react to very quickly as we adjust the workforce. I think what takes us a little bit longer on the Domestic side is also the revenue side of it. So it's not just looking at cost. We have to do things on revenue management side to improve that side of the ledger. I think we're looking at things, looking at account strategies. We need to focus more on the middle market. I think a lot of our growth, the first half of the year, came from large customers. So we have kind of rededicated ourselves to look at the middle market. I think the small and medium-sized enterprises are really not -- are suffering right now with all the uncertainty in the country, but they still have shipping needs, and we'll focus on them.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "You talked about customer behavior changing as they move around the supply chain, trading down to more deferred products. Where are you seeing the largest behavior changes? Is it air to ocean?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "No. Probably most notable is within products going from, perhaps, an express to an afternoon delivery, the Saver and our Next Day Air. In Europe, we've seen significant trade down from our transborder express to transborder standard, although we have seen a few structural changes on some of the global exporters, perhaps moving away from express, moving freight movements and then distributing them once they get across the border. Clearly, we have products like Trade Direct to help address that. But this is a period, I think, when we're seeing companies try different things. I don't think it's been hugely material, but there is some mode shift and some speed changes.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes. I think the surprising thing, and I talked about it in my comments, Kevin, was this -- the global trade in general. To have exports growing at a lesser rate than global GDP is really unusual, and we think that is temporary and it'll change going forward. But trying to figure out what's going on, I think the biggest driver of that is the slow demand in the developed world. I think there is a lot of people trying to analyze what's going on. But frankly, Europe and the U.S. both have low demand right now, and that's what\u2019s causing those negative numbers out of Asia. The other areas that will be a challenge going forward is U.S. exports to Europe. I think Europe will not be a big consuming country for a while, so the U.S. exports will remain quite weak to Europe.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "On the U.S. Small Package business, I was curious what the trends look like in the quarter, April, May and June. You called out the uncertainty, and it sounded like, to Tom's question, that you alluded to further actions that are going to have to be taken within that business to right-size to what you're kind of expecting volumes on the B2B side to look like in the back half. 3.5% volume felt good, and obviously, there's mix stuff going on there. But did we see any kind of precipitous fall-off in June? Or are you seeing that as we've come into July that's got you guys worried? I'm just trying to get a better sense of where we're going here.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. I think kind of a soft landing maybe is the best way to think of it. We've seen -- we were very pleased and a little surprised that the demand have picked up in the fourth quarter and burned through the second -- or the first quarter. We saw over the course of the quarter, and really into July, just a gradual softening, really, with the B2B being the most notable change. That's why you don't see it as much in our aggregate volumes, because the B2C has continued to be very strong with our service offerings. But I think just kind of this continual moderate slowing in the rate of growth and then into the trends that we're seeing.", "D. Scott Davis", "Now, Justin, it was clearly -- clearly, our macro concerns start with the fact that we saw lousy numbers in the last couple of months, and ISM manufacturing, clearly, was bad. Retail sales was weak in June. As we get closer to the fiscal cliff, there's just more uncertainty out there than ever. It's hard for me to say how it's going to turn around until we get some policymaking done in Washington. We have a 3- or 4- or 5-year horizon, and people cannot make decisions without that. So I think it's going to get tougher before it gets better. It will get better.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe a question just on Europe, if you could just give us a sense of kind of what the trends were there. Sounds like you had a little bit of growth on the volume side, but I just want to get an overall sense if you are seeing a deceleration in that region as well.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, we saw a little bit of a deceleration, although, frankly, Europe continues to be a good story for us. One of the macro shifts, or at least changes in trends, we are seeing is that the intra-regional shipments within North America, within Europe are continuing to show growth. Intra-Asia continues to show growth, and then the intercontinental shipments are a little weaker. So we're clearly seeing trade-down in Europe, so the premium products are not doing as well. But our trans-European shipments on the standard side are healthy. We have seen some declines on the Domestic volumes within the EU, although some of that is just revenue management activities. But we do see the economic declines a little more in our Domestic segment. But Europe's continuing to trade within itself, and that's why we continue to focus on it, to help Europe become more and more efficient.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Kurt, you mentioned the -- you're looking to decrease some costs. Can you kind of walk us through? It sounds like on the International move, you've made the move to pull out the 10%. Maybe on the domestic move during the downturn, you had kind of shut down some regional facilities. I don't know if they had reopened. What kind of steps can you -- can we expect to make, and what kind of cost leverage should we look for from that?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. I think on the International side, we've really made the decisions in -- and are making the big network changes, although, clearly, there's a tremendous amount of in-country work that can still be done internationally. It's just they're probably 70% to 80% on the way to getting it done. Domestically, I don't anticipate huge network restructuring, although we are looking at our capacity and usage, both in the air and the ground network, to make sure we're adjusting appropriately. We'll be looking at a typical range of costs, looking at initiatives, discretionary spending, really just making sure we've recalibrated the network. And, Ken, if you really look over the last 3 to 4 quarters, we've seen a pretty dramatic mix shift, volume coming from different areas going to different areas. And so we're looking at this as an opportunity, really, to step back and adjust the network and our expenses to match conditions and, at the same time, as Scott mentioned, also to revisit broadly where we are on the revenue and the management of that, both at the account level and also at the product level. So this is the time in which we're going to take a hard look. We've -- we're teeing up a significant number of initiatives to take a look, given this slow patch that we're in right now, to adjust and reposition ourselves to improve our competitiveness.", "D. Scott Davis", "We're really going to take advantage of the decentralization of marketing, where now we have the marketing teams in the districts who can look at the specific circumstances and adapt to it. So it will help us as we come out of this.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess following up from the answer to Ken's question there. As you go through your account and your products review process, does that mean we're still going to see a lot of the focus on the B2C growth, but maybe some better core pricing on the core business?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I wouldn't lead to any one specific result on that. It's just -- it's been about a year or so since we've really broadened the portfolio and focused on expanding the footprint into the lightweight, migrating into that. So clearly the B2C issues, the product positioning will be important. And then of course, given -- looking at the entire part of the core portfolio will be a part also.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Could you help characterize like the -- how much of the reduction in your guidance is from a slowing or less-than-expected recovery in International volumes versus the weakening Domestic picture?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Probably the bigger change in the quarter has been the Domestic outlook. Clearly, the International got a little bit worse than we thought. We thought our export volumes would be up a couple of percent more, and yes, the exports out of Asia really did fall off a cliff. So there were some there, but the more material issue really has been the deceleration in the core Domestic demand and some of the economic conditions I think that Scott has talked about.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, exactly. I think in the second quarter, clearly, International was the biggest culprit. But going forward, I think the challenge is going to be Domestic, and as we said before, just a lot of weak numbers over the last 2 months caused us concern for the next 6 months.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So the outlook has been more affected by the slowdown in Domestic?", "D. Scott Davis", "Outlook in Domestic, correct, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "There is a meaningful step-down in your view, obviously, of the U.S. economy. And I'm trying just to understand, Scott, how much of this is reading the data that you're seeing coming out of the government and how much of this is specific to what you're either hearing from your customers or seeing in your volumes in June and July? And when did you kind of take this step-down in your view of the world?", "D. Scott Davis", "Ed, I think it\u2019s a combination, as you'd expect. I think, clearly, the recent numbers have been disappointing that we've seen over the last 2 months, but I think it's a combination of doing that and talking to customers. And again, the lion's share of our customers are small business. And you talk to them, they are very much concerned with all that's going to happen at the end of this year, with the fiscal cliff. And we all read the impact if all the Bush tax cuts go away and the sequestration hits. And you could have a 4% impact. Our customers read that. So I'd say it's a combination of the 2. They're -- customers are concerned. They're not going to invest. They're not going to hire people. They're not going to stock inventory with all that uncertainty. I think Bob Zoellick said the other day even, \"We're one debt ceiling deal away from getting this economy going again.\" So we got to get that done.", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Is the 3.5% domestic volume throughout the quarter much worse in June than it was in April or in July than it was in June?", "D. Scott Davis", "Just slightly worse, I think, slightly worse.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I wanted to talk a little bit just on the pricing side. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty on the volume. But kind of with some of the trade-down and also just with the worsening kind of outlook for a lot of your customers, how are you seeing the pricing environment in terms of pushing through everything that you would have liked to?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "We think the pricing environment remains fairly stable and firm, and if you do dissect and decompose the mix changes and the customer size and all of that, the pricing is stable, and we are seeing positive core pricing and base rate increases. So we're not overly concerned on the pricing environment. Although, clearly, if the economy slows more, there'll be, perhaps, a little more pressure. So I think for us it's more just a broad portfolio review and making sure that we're balanced and adapted to where we are seeing demand and adjusting where we're not.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can I ask for a little bit of clarification on the comments that you made, I think it was last week, just that UPS does intend to bid on the postal service business, the priority mail contract? I was always under the impression that one of the reasons FedEx had that business was because of the size of their air fleet. Do you have the sort of underutilization in your air fleet that you could handle that? Or would it all go through the ground network? How does this -- I don't sort of know how that would fit into the UPS network.", "D. Scott Davis", "Bill, I think, clearly, we have the air network and ground network to satisfy those needs. USPS has informed us the intent to solicit bids on these air services for September 2013 forward. We've informed them that we're clearly interested in bidding on that business. Today, we already do well over $100 million of line haul with the post office. We've got a strong, strong international air network, world-class network. We have proven logistics capabilities. We think it fit very well into UPS in the future.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So it wouldn't -- there's no capacity constraint for you.", "D. Scott Davis", "No, I mean, we'll have to do some adjustments to our capacity, getting a lot of this done in the 2-day network. We can do some things on the ground. So we can make it fit.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "You mentioned with regard to Asia that it's, in large part, a function of weaker demand in the U.S. and Europe, which suggests that it's cyclical. But are you seeing any things that are more secular? Any kind of relocation of supply chains out of Asia that suggest that even when economies recover, maybe Asia won't be quite as strong as it used to be for you?", "D. Scott Davis", "I think that's overdone. I think that there's some of that going on, but it, clearly, is not the driving force right now between the -- the gap between global trade and global GDP. So I think we're seeing a little bit of it. But we go out and talk to our customers, you see very few instances where they've actually taken manufacturing and brought it back home or brought it back close to home. I think that's more likely if energy prices were to get to the $150 level. Then I think you look at that again. But I think it's -- there's more dislocation in China going to West China, things like that going on, than there is China back to U.S. or to Mexico.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue will come from the line of Mr. John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.", "John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just as you've revised down the outlook for the balance of this year, can you talk about just your CapEx outlook as well? And if things were to decelerate further, how much more quickly could you take your CapEx down as well? Or is there things that you could put on hold or cancel outright and kind of reserve that cash?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, John, certainly, we've got flexibility, although, frankly, we're down to only 4% of revenue for CapEx this year, and we have been for the last 3 or 4 years. So we're -- we are at historically low levels. I guess the other element, at least, looking out a couple of years, is we just got another 2 years of major deliveries of aircraft. And then after that, we'll be in pretty good shape, we think, for the medium term, at least. So CapEx, we'll -- I wouldn't imagine dramatic changes, although things like vehicles and some facilities, we can react pretty quickly on. So we're generating very strong cash flow. So right now, that's the least of our worries. As we mentioned, we've got $7 billion in cash and marketable securities. Some of that's offset with some short-term liabilities, but we are focused on building the appropriate balance sheet to be able to close the TNT deal, really, without having to go out and issue any long-term debt. So we feel very comfortable with cash flow. One of the attributes, I think, of UPS that makes us unique is, even in tough times, we've remained extremely cash flow positive. So we'll look at capital expenditures. We will reduce the things that aren't essential. On the other hand, you look at investments like expanding Worldport through the midst of the recession. We're also going to continue to do those things that add long-term value no matter what the economic climate is.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee & Leach.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Could you discuss the currency effects and how it's affecting you both top line and bottom line and what this looks like for the rest of fiscal year?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, Jeff. It is a turbulent period for currency. And although it's funny with us moving towards the TNT closure, we're not sure which way to vote for the euro, frankly. It had a very significant impact on revenue. If you look at -- without currency adjustment, our yields in International were down 2.5%. But if you look on our web schedules at the next page, it shows that if you currency adjust, they were up 2.1%. So that's almost 4.5% impact of currency on our International revenues, and that doesn't include anything on the Supply Chain & Freight. So it is a turbulent period, creating some challenges for year-over-year comps and also for profit planning. We do have some hedges in place that are helping to mitigate the P&L impact, and currency was just a minor negative in the quarter and, frankly, was more or less offset by a slight positive on fuel. So it has not been a big deal so far, although clearly, over the time, as -- if euro stays very low, then there will be some earnings translation impact. On the flip side, we do have a pretty big check to write to complete the TNT acquisition, and a low euro clearly makes that much less expensive in dollar terms.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "No, that's what I was going to ask. I mean, I guess it got about 14% cheaper this quarter.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "It's dropped quite a bit. And I think at the time that we announced the deal, it was 1 32, something like that. And so it has dropped almost 10% now, which, certainly, in dollar terms is good news.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Company.", "David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company", "My question is on the Olympics. You talked about that during your presentation, talking in terms of 30 million packages. And when I look at the potential international package count in the third quarter, it comes in around 150 million. That sounds like a big increase. But on the other hand, I didn't see any big revenue growth when you did the Beijing games 4 years ago. So I'm just curious as to where we'll see and will we see the revenue benefit from that -- those gains.", "D. Scott Davis", "David, you won't see the revenue there. You won't see the volume of pieces. It's a combination and partly sponsorship. We get compensated for pieces of what we're doing there. It's primarily about brand recognition. I think we did a great job in Beijing, where like our brand recognition went up about 33% in Beijing. We want to do the same thing in Europe, and the timing is perfect for the TNT acquisition coming forward. So it's primarily about brand. You won't see it in the P&L.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Mr. Ben Hartford of William -- or excuse me, Robert William Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I just wanted to get your perspective on inventories and the weakness, the volume weakness that you're seeing on the margin here in the United States. Could you provide some sort of characterization on inventories, where we sit today, maybe retail versus industrial? It seems as though industrial inventory's on balance or slightly heavier than one might have expected to end 2Q. Are we seeing inventory reductions? Are we seeing a pause as shippers manage towards very, very tight inventories? Could you provide any sort of context on that?", "D. Scott Davis", "It's hard to really see the visibility of inventories, Ben. I think it's hard for economists. It's hard for the government to see that. I'm always skeptical on those reports. But I think in general, from us talking to customers, I think inventories are quite low. It's hard to imagine them getting much lower than they are today, I think, across-the-board, both on the manufacturing side and the retail side. Now visibility tools and those technology, that makes it easier to manage inventories, but I would say from our vantage point, inventories are rock bottom right now.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Comp and benefit as a percent of revenue, so that ratio has been falling every quarter since 2009, and we're at record levels now. Well, we were at first quarter. This is the first quarter where that percentage was up. It's been the biggest area of margin expansion since the trough in '09. So I guess my question is, are we kind of going into a 1 to maybe 2-quarter transition period where you realign the Domestic and International networks and then we get further improvement in the comp and benefits line as a percent of revenue? Or are we starting to bump up against really where you can -- where you end up maxing out?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, that's a good question, because, clearly, there's -- we are seeing, as I mentioned, some headwinds, especially on the benefit side. We have had a couple of years of good experience on our health care. And just in the last, I'd say, 3, 4 months, we've started to see some trends of increasing expenses, increased number of lives handled per employee as perhaps more people latch onto UPS insurance, perhaps if the second working spouse doesn't have insurance, and some increased experience. So that's the most notable cost change, and we did guide that, that may drive domestic comp and ben up almost 1%. So there is some headwinds on that side. Clearly, that cycles a little bit, and we'll -- we're continuing to evaluate that and work on it. Other than that, I think with the continued focused on productivity, the automation of our operations, the information-driven pickup and delivery that we've got and the focus on lightweight, which certainly drives less direct hours, we should continue to see positive trends. So we're able to manage that in line with comp and -- with volume levels. But right now, at least, I think you have the health and welfare expenses. Pension also, is driving over $100 million this year. And so that is an element that, at least, for the next couple of quarters is going to be an outlier.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose.", "Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a question on the declines that you're making in the capacity adjustment. So it takes a couple of quarters to bring that down. And then I suppose when things start to turn around, it will take a quarter or so to bring it back. So by making these adjustments now, are you thinking that any downturn is kind of a 4-quarter event? Or how should we think about the potential if things do or when you think things do turn around?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Helane, that's good question. I think you almost have to separate the International and the Domestic. Clearly, we have made some fairly significant reductions in the Asia, capacity to Europe and, most notably, to U.S. There is a lag there for planning schedules and all that. We do think that we'll see some uplift in the fourth quarter though. There are some major product launches coming in the fourth quarter, and at least, we do have some optimism that, that Asia export will pick up then. So we'll plan accordingly. And we can react with ad hoc flights and those things, although they're typically not as efficient. We think in the U.S., this has been a gradual process. And so we're adapting, and clearly, we'll be responsive and flexible if the holiday season comes in stronger than planned. But at this point, we're probably erring on the cautious side.", "D. Scott Davis", "Right, right. Helane, definitely, in Domestic, we can take them up and bring them down quicker than we can in International.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "On the cost side, Kurt, most of the costs were held in check in the quarter, but the other expenses line item rose over 8% year-over-year. You mentioned that there were some costs related to the M&A activity, but what were the other big contributors there?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, one of the things, you do have the credit last year of over $30 million because of the real estate transactions. That's the most notable, and in the other-other line anyway, that distorted things a little bit. Other than that, the network's in pretty good shape. Repairs and maintenance are moderated, little bit of increase in depreciation as we've brought in a number of new aircraft. So the only real notable expenses in the other-other part of it is the last year issue, and frankly, we do have some increased expenses that show up in that line, legal fees and some of those things. So your instincts are right that, that's where some of the M&A expenses show up.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "You mentioned the importance of B2C going forward. Would you mind touching on some trends you're seeing there, maybe uptake in My Choice, any changes in package weight sizes and anything you're doing on the productivity front with B2C?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. We're continuing to see just great success on that front. The -- I think we're up over 1.5 million unique My Choice customers now that have shipped over 13 million shipments, and it continues to be one that's -- that there's a lot of interest in, kind of a viral issue. Once people start getting used to these proactive notifications, their ability to redirect shipments and just know what's going on, it has been very well received. So that's been a great product offering from the receiver or the buyer. And then we are seeing increased interest, frankly, by some of the high-quality Internet shippers in helping their customers become My Choice members, because it really eliminates a lot of the where-is-my-package phone calls. So it offers a direct savings to Internet companies in support and also increases satisfaction. So we remain very excited about that. It still is a very unique and distinctive offering, and that is a big part of our value proposition these days.", "D. Scott Davis", "And that's kind of U.S. focused. We obviously have the global B2C focus, too, and the Kiala acquisition that we announced 3 or 4 months ago is making great progress also. We're continuing to invest in technology there, so we're excited about having the alternative delivery locations available for our customers. So it'll continue to grow. We'll continue to invest in it.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you put any color on what My Choice does for you operationally? I mean, it sounds like there's benefits for you in there as well.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, there is. There is. The -- one of the most frustrating things for any delivery company is when there's a package that needs to have a signature or monies collected and people aren't home. It creates a disconnect. It drives an additional delivery attempt, an added expense, added miles. So with My Choice, people, A, get a prediction of when the package will arrive. And if they want a different time, they can select that for a premium charge or they can redirect it to another location. So there is a direct operating savings also.", "Operator", "Our next question will be a follow-up from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. I wanted to ask you kind of a broader question. When we think about Europe as -- seems to be in recession, and if you look at 2013 and 2014 and you think about that TNT acquisition and integration and so forth, is it tougher to be successful in integrating and holding on to business and producing the results with TNT if the European economy is soft? Or given that a lot of your activity is going to be cost takeout, is that actually an okay environment in terms of if you think about complicated integration of putting 2 pieces together?", "D. Scott Davis", "I'd always pick a strong, growing economy, Tom, if I had my picks. But frankly, I think Europe is not far different from what we thought when we announced this thing back in March. I think it's about where we thought it'd be, so no surprises. We're going to work very well together, I think, and have a customer-focused integration. I don't think what we're seeing right now changes anything. I like a better economy. I like a stronger economy. But the numbers we said and quoted back in March are numbers that will still see as achievable.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess I just wanted to put some context around the 10% reduction in the Asian capacity. Where were you guys, as of now, relative to plan at the beginning of the year, in terms of level below on that air capacity? And then I think, Kurt, you alluded to the potential for a product cycle on the tech side in the fourth quarter. I mean, how quickly can you ramp back up? And where does this 10% put you in terms of critical mass in that market? And how much further could you go down if you saw things deteriorate? Just trying to get some ideas around this cut.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Okay, a couple of folder -- a couple of pieces to that one. Clearly, things are weaker than we thought when we developed plans for this year. That 10% reduction was not anticipated. We have -- we were reacting to the slowdown that began, frankly, about this time last year. We seem to be jinxed with July business trends. And so we had implemented that first 10% reduction, and most of that was in reduced frequencies, maybe 4 days a week rather than 6, that kind of a thing, in some cases, for cargo and for our deferred products, we can catch up to those during the off days. This latest series of reductions has been a tough decision for us, because we have to adjust our costs. But on the other hand, as many of you have mentioned, with an anticipated product cycle that may drive capacity, we've got to be ready for it. So we had not anticipated those reductions, but we've gone through and we still really -- we've held service fully intact across the continents. So it's not that we've made dramatic changes in customer experience, but we may have gone from 3 or 4 flights from a given airport down to 2 or 3. So once again, it's more reduction in the service frequencies and the number of flights, but we are getting pretty tight. We're taking our network down to -- beginning to get to the -- close to the point where we were at the low time in 2009. So it is -- we're fairly lean right now. On the other hand, given the fact that we do expect to see some uplift in the fourth quarter, we're in position for that, making sure we have the assets and can react accordingly. On the tech side, yes, we do expect product launches. We've talked to some of the major OEMs then, so that's all built into our plans, and one of the reasons why, frankly, we are looking for stronger profit improvements in Q4 as compared to what will likely be a challenging Q3. Especially with Europe in August and the weak conditions in Europe, we think this will be a pretty soft August.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to see if we could get just some broad commentary on the upcoming Teamster's negotiations. So if we think back to the last contract that you signed, it sort of had this aspect of, look, there are some pretty big changes that we've made here to gain on productivity, but then, of course, we went into a downturn, and it didn't get the volume growth we expected. So I think -- and you can correct me if I think this is a wrong characterization. But I think, perhaps, it didn't get the quite the savings you expected. Are there any sort of changes in how you'll sort of approach the ask this time around? Or is it more kind of a let's keep going down this path, because we think, eventually, we will have an upturn and get the volume growth and the productivity?", "D. Scott Davis", "Bill, I think that the good thing is that the formal talks begin soon, but even better thing is that we've been communicating regularly since the last contract. And the competition committees that we have set up with the Teamsters and our own people, we address all the issues very frequently. So we look at competitive aspects. I think all the issues that are impacting us and the Teamsters have been on the table already. When we get to the formal talks here in September, I think it's -- nothing is going to be a surprise of what's going on here. So I'm very optimistic that there's no surprises on either sides as we get together in September.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. But clearly, we have to work together to adapt and change, and it will not be a business-as-usual discussion. And so we're looking creatively for ways to allow UPS to grow, and we've seen great examples of that and, at the same time, also allow us to be able to generate profit improvements. We just don't talk about the details in public. But as Scott said, we think the environment's very productive. We talk about both the opportunities and the problems we face and do expect things to be favorably resolved.", "D. Scott Davis", "But to your point, Bill, the world is a lot different than it was 5 years ago. So that certainly is part of the talks.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, right. I mean, just, obviously, it's a recognition of kind of things have changed from last time. So I thought maybe there's scope for a bigger discussion, but I appreciate the thoughts.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So in the context of all the International export volumes being under pressure, and it sounds like you guys are going to be adjusting the network down, but at the same time, it looks like DHL is actually adding aircraft into their international network. Can you comment on the pricing environment in International exports, the long-haul transcon stuff?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I think the package environment looks relatively stable. We have seen some volatility, I guess, in pricing on the Freight side and some of the heavy lift of the large shipments. You've got to separate the wheat from the chaff a little bit on capacity increases and see how much is going on. So we don't see huge amounts of capacity being added to the network, no matter what the press releases say, and we think the market's pretty rational.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So the -- no slowdown in the heavyweight package pricing?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, clearly, Freight yields right now are weaker. You saw that in our Forwarding revenues, that rates are lower right now on the Forwarding and on the cargo side. Our forwarder, though, has operated very effectively. As I said, we had peak margins for Supply Chain & Freight this quarter. I know that there's a lot of other big stuff going on, but that has been a great process for us, and we're on both sides of the equation. We see as -- having an airlift, the package environment is stable. But cargo and Freight rates are certainly weak, but then our forwarder has been able to capitalize on that and generate the -- really, the best margins we've seen.", "Operator", "Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Just on the LTL, there hasn't been much conversation about that. Are you seeing slowing trends there? And can you give some sense of what the operating ratio look like at the LTL division?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. Ed, you're right. That's yet another business that we haven\u2019t had a chance to chat about it. I guess we're getting too diversified. No, Freight had a strong quarter on the profit side. We had mid-single-digit margins with significant improvements over last year. We have seen growth moderating in the industry, and clearly, we were fairly disciplined on the pricing and volume that we targeted. So we do think that the industry is slowing a bit, but we've been very pleased by the productivity, some of the operational technology we're putting in. And so a good, solid quarter for the Freight side, but not -- it's not a super exciting time, we think, for shipment growth.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Andy Dolny for any closing remarks.", "Andy Dolny", "Yes.

My name is Stephen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations' Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Investor -- Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning. Today, I'm joined by Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and future expectations. In addition, in an effort to increase access to UPS leadership, we have asked David Abney, our COO; Dan Brutto, International President; Alan Gershenhorn, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; and Myron Gray, President of U.S. Operations, to participate today and in future calls.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2011 Form 10-K and 2012 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "In August, we announced restructuring of the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund. As a result, in our third quarter earnings, UPS recorded a noncash charge of $896 million. On an after tax basis, the impact was $559 million or $0.58 per share. Excluding the effect of this transaction, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.06. In our remarks today, we will refer to UPS third quarter 2012 results excluding the impact of this charge.", "Additionally, all 2012 full year references and comparisons to 2011 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules, along with the webcast of today's call, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.", "A couple of reminders, any guidance that we provide does not include any operating results, synergies or post-closing integration expense related to TNT. Also, our outlook does not include any potential pension, mark-to-market entry. If interest rates stay as low as they are, UPS will likely record a sizable mark-to-market charge in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, this will not affect cash flow or require funding. While this charge would impact our GAAP earnings, it will be excluded in adjusted results. [Operator Instructions]", "Now let me turn it over to Scott.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy, and good morning. Our third quarter results reflect the ability of UPSers to meet the needs of our customers while making the necessary adjustments in an environment of shifting market conditions. The U.S. Domestic business benefited from e-commerce. International results have rebounded as exports from Asia grew slightly. Europe was steady, however, U.S. exports remained weak. The Supply Chain & Freight segment continued to deliver strong operating margins.", "Now let's take a quick look at the global economy. In Europe, more countries are slipping into recession as they impose austerity measures. Though the economy there has contracted, the small package market has not.", "In Asia, although projections have come down, economic growth there leads the world. Although as I said last quarter, exports continue to lag GDP growth.", "Here in the U.S., where some of the recent economic indicators provide optimism, general economists have lowered their expectations for the remainder of the year. The lack of clear direction on future tax and spending policy has and will continue to slow business investment. This will clearly impact the B2B small package market.", "Regardless of the outcome in November, the U.S. is on the edge of a fiscal cliff, and there is concern whether our politicians can reach an agreement that solves these issues. The lack of political will to fix our debt problem adds to the uncertainty in our economy, just what we don't need.", "That's why we are supporting Fix The Debt, the organization founded by former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson and Clinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles. Our goal is to have a bipartisan debt reduction plan drafted when Congress returns in January, and we believe it's realistic to have it passed in early 2013. If solutions are in place to both reduce our deficit and eliminate the threat of a fiscal cliff, the U.S. will be in a much better position for sustained economic growth.", "During the quarter, UPS began formal negotiations with the Teamsters more than 10 months early. We believe an early start will lead to an early conclusion, and this is beneficial for all stakeholders.", "In addition, UPS successfully completed the largest nonmilitary logistics event ever when the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games closed. I personally want to thank the thousands of UPSers who worked to ensure the success of these games. Great job. The logistic support of the London Olympics is a prime example of our transformation and the trust the international community has placed in UPS. We've invested over the decades to build unique capabilities, trading the world's logistics provider.", "Further demonstrating the UPS strategy of investing to grow is our planned acquisition of TNT Express. We recently received a Statement of Objection from the European Commission. This is not uncommon. We're evaluating this confidential document and will respond in due course.", "UPS still expects to close this transaction early next year. We have committed to complete this acquisition and enhance our position in the logistics industry. We are further strengthening the UPS brand and positioning the company for worldwide growth, well into the future.", "Speaking of brand, earlier this month, Interbrand announced their 2012 list of 100 Best Global Brands, and UPS, once again, ranked #1 in our industry. Finally, UPSers around the world are gearing up for the holiday rush, and I'm confident that no matter what Mother Nature throws our way, UPS will deliver.", "Now Kurt will review our results for the quarter.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Given the economic climate, UPS executed well during the quarter with earnings per share of $1.06. This is down slightly compared to last year, primarily due to a lower tax rate in 2011. Total UPS daily volume grew 2.9%. Revenue was down slightly due to one less operating day while operating profit and margin were flat with last year.", "During last quarter's call, we discussed our concern for global economic expansion, particularly here in the U.S., and we've taken the necessary steps with network changes and other adjustments. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you what we've accomplished over the past 3 months.", "Starting with U.S. Domestic, the segment generated operating margin of 13%. Operating profits were down slightly compared to last year as the quarter was negatively impacted by $60 million in fuel surcharge lag, as well as the one less operating day that I just mentioned. While business-to-business declined a bit, average daily volume growth was slightly higher than anticipated across all products, advanced entirely by B2C.", "Ground rose 3% fueled by both lightweight and traditional residential products. Not only are e-commerce shippers leveraging our extensive Ground solutions, but they also continue to look to UPS premium products to enhance their competitive edge. As a result, Next Day Air volume increased almost 6% and our Deferred air products jumped more than 9%.", "Total revenue per piece declined by about 1%. Base rate improvement was more than offset by significantly lower fuel surcharges, as well as changes in both product and customer mix. The rapid growth in lightweight B2C shipments continue to push average weight per package lower. Ground revenue per piece was up slightly while Next Day Air and Deferred were down 4.6% and 5.1%, respectively. Next Day Saver growth continues to outpace A.M. products as shippers realize its value for residential deliveries.", "Once again, UPS technology innovations contributed to better cost control and efficiency gains in the network. In fact, paid hours, miles driven and aircraft block hours all increased less than volume. While U.S. Domestic results were solid, UPS remains constructively dissatisfied. As B2C expands, we are continuing to adapt both our business model and revenue strategies. UPS technology will ensure that our integrated network remains flexible, providing the ability to react quickly to evolving dynamics in the marketplace.", "Now let's review our International results. This segment rebounded after a few tough quarters in a row. In fact, we had a record third quarter operating profit of $449 million. Clearly, the results of our initiatives are bearing fruit. Network adjustments, combined with in-country cost management, resulted in operating profit growth of 7.7%. Operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 15.3%. Benefits derived from currency exceeded the headwind generated by higher fuel costs. We also incurred about $20 million in acquisition-related expenses, which were offset by other onetime items, including a pension adjustment.", "UPS average daily export volume was up 1.2% with slight increases in Asia and Europe while U.S. exports continue to disappoint. Non-U.S. Domestic average daily volume declined 2.7% due to the slowing global economy and UPS's revenue management initiatives in Europe. Fluctuations in currency and the lower fuel surcharge drove the revenue decline of 3.7%. When adjusted for these, third quarter revenue was up slightly. Looking at revenue per piece on a currency-neutral basis, non-U.S. Domestic improved 3% and export was relatively flat, reflecting the continuing shift in trade patterns and customer migration to less premium products.", "Now for Supply Chain & Freight. This segment, once again, generated an operating margin in excess of 8%. Although revenue fell $75 million, operating profit was down just $15 million. Declines in our Forwarding unit were partially offset by improved UPS Freight results. UPS Freight revenue improved 3.6%, due to growth in LTL tonnage and revenue per hundredweight.", "UPS technology innovations, like pickup notification, have proven very popular with our customers. Yield gains and productivity improvements contributed to another quarter of operating margin expansion. Poor industry conditions due to overcapacity in the Asia airfreight market pushed revenue and margin lower in the Forwarding unit.", "Meanwhile, in Distribution, demand for UPS healthcare solutions was a strong contributor to revenue growth, although investments in healthcare technology infrastructure and facilities did weigh on margins. Recently, UPS opened 3 new state-of-the-art facilities in China and Australia, adding more than 350,000 square feet of healthcare-compliant capacity in Asia.", "Looking now at cash in our balance sheet. UPS generated more than $3.6 billion in free cash flow after capital expenditures of $1.6 billion. The company also paid $1.6 billion in dividends.", "During the quarter, UPS took advantage of market opportunities to acquire more than 7 million shares. Year-to-date, the company has repurchased 18.5 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Our target for full year purchases remains unchanged at $1.5 billion. Total outstanding shares for the fourth quarter are expected to be about 5 million shares lower than in the third quarter.", "The financial quality of UPS was obvious during our recent bond offering, which was oversubscribed sevenfold. The $1.75 billion in 5-, 10- and 30-year notes is being used to replace debt maturing in January. We made the decision to go to the market a few months early, given the historically low rates. We achieved an average yield of 2.45% on debt with an average maturity of 13 years. As a result of this issuance and in anticipation of closing the TNT acquisition next year, UPS ended the quarter with more than $9 billion in cash and marketable securities.", "And now to guidance. The UPS business model performed well during the quarter, and the macro environment was, for the most part, consistent with our assumptions. Given our performance and greater confidence in fourth quarter execution, we have enhanced our full year earnings guidance to a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share, an increase of 5% to 7% over last year. We are basically reaffirming guidance around our previous midpoint, but narrowing the range to reflect the higher degree of earning certainty.", "If you remember, 4Q '11 was a record quarter for UPS. That being said, in fourth quarter of this year, we expect all 3 segments to increase operating profits and to generate margins similar to or slightly above last year.", "In U.S. Domestic segment for the quarter, we anticipate operating margin will once again exceed 15%, and average daily volume growth should be about 3%, driven by B2C in both lightweight and Saver.", "For International, we expect mid-single-digit operating profit growth in Q4 with slight improvement in average daily volume growth trends. This guidance includes a similar amount of acquisition-related expenses to what we saw in the third quarter.", "In Supply Chain & Freight, though we expect the challenging airfreight environment to continue, for the fourth quarter, operating profit should increase moderately on relatively flat revenue.", "Certainly, consumer behavior during the upcoming holidays will affect where UPS earnings fall within the $4.55 to $4.65 range. As we demonstrated during the 2011 peak season, UPS is ready and more than able to handle whatever comes our way.", "But before I turn it over to Alan Gershenhorn for an update on peak season, I do want to encourage all of you consumers out there to indulge during the upcoming holidays, purchase lots of gifts and, of course, have them shipped UPS. Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Thanks, Kurt. As everyone knows, the holidays are a busy time around UPS. Every peak season, millions of customers count on more than 400,000 UPSers to successfully manage the sharp and sudden increase in deliveries. This surge will take our daily average of about 15 million packages up to 28 million on this year's peak day, the most ever in our 105-year history. It is truly awe-inspiring, and in my 32-peak seasons, I've always been impressed for how our people get the job done. This year will be no exception.", "The dramatic rise of e-commerce continues to alter consumer behavior and shipping patterns. Historically, peak season volume ramped up from Thanksgiving to Christmas. This year, we are planning for 2 peak periods: one that revolves around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the other compressed into the 2 weeks before Christmas.", "Speaking to our global customer base about their expectations for this holiday season, they tell us they are cautious. However, they also remain optimistic. Economic uncertainty around the world has them uneasy about how their consumers will respond this year. On another note, the retail inventory to sales ratio is still historically low. So their supply chain is constrained to keep up if demand is more than predicted.", "And although consumer confidence has increased recently, there is still concern relative to political and fiscal uncertainty. According to a recent survey, 70% of Americans say the current state of the economy is impacting their spending plans, and as a result, forecast for holiday retail sales call for lower growth. The National Retail Federation is projecting a 4.1% rise in holiday sales, which is below last year's 5.6% but still above the 10-year average. More importantly for UPS, e-commerce sales are expected to jump 12% over last year, so demand for our lightweight and Deferred air products is expected to be high.", "As the season develops, UPS will be ready. In fact, we already started the hiring process for temporary employees. This peak, they will help deliver more than 0.5 billion packages around the globe.", "And to support both shippers and consumers during the holidays, UPS offers many unique solutions. For example, UPS My Choice, which was launched at this time last year, is unmatched in the industry. Almost 2 million households have signed up and are enjoying the benefits. Advantages like providing delivery alerts by e-mail or SMS the day before your package is delivered, eliminating those \"sorry we missed you\" notices left on your door or the ability to reschedule or reroute deliveries or one of the most popular features, authorizing UPS to deliver without a signature. So if you haven't signed up for UPS My Choice yet, I strongly encourage you to join the almost 2 million who have and enjoy an exceptional package delivery experience this holiday season courtesy of UPS.", "Thanks, and now we'll be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Wanted to ask you about the domestic side and a couple of things going on with mix. Can you give us a sense of how much B2C was up and how much B2B was down? And then also I guess in terms of that topic, how would you look at margins going forward if you continue to see that trend of B2C growth and slower, I guess -- or modestly declining B2B?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Tom, yes, B2C has continued to show slight declines. So we're -- it didn't get significantly worse from Q2 to Q3. But clearly, with some of the challenges in the industrial sector and some of those areas, we're just not seeing a lot of strength there. So B2C was absolutely the primary driver of the volume growth. And as we've said, this is one of the big market changes that we're adapting our business model to, so it -- the B2C is a little more challenging. But as you've seen, both the operational technology side and the consumer side, we're focusing enhancements to address that.", "D. Scott Davis", "And, Tom, our long-term targets on Domestic are 14% to 15% margins, 2014 to 2016. We're not backing off those margins as we move forward.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Can you give the actual numbers of what B2B and B2C were, Kurt, or you don't care to be that specific?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "B2C was upper single digits, and the B2B was slightly negative.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe a question just on the International side. You mentioned the Asia outbound picking up a little bit. I just wanted to get a sense of whether that was specifically around product launches, maybe the sustainability of that, and how we should think about that relative to capacity. Do we get a sense that you kind of got to the right point of capacity relative to demand right now? And how do you think about the fourth quarter?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Right, yes. It certainly was great to see Asia get into positive numbers again, and I think it is a little bit of both of the issues that you mentioned. I'll let Dan Brutto talk about that a little bit.", "Daniel J. Brutto", "Sure. I guess what I would say as far as the network cutbacks, certainly, we've done that. But I would also say that we've also added in aircraft. We just added our fifth gateway in China. It started the middle of September at Hangzhou, primarily for the high-tech sector. And that kind of coincides with what's going on in China, this whole go-west strategy. So you've got a lot of manufacturers now in China that are moving off the east coast to the west. Last year, we opened up another gateway in Chengdu, essentially for the high tech. So we're moving our equipment where the customers are, and certainly, it was good to see, finally, a small uptick in Asia this quarter.", "D. Scott Davis", "We think that this slow global trade is cyclical and that it will come back. I think one of the things we talk a lot about is this fiscal cliff in the U.S., if we resolve that, get the U.S. economy consumer going again, that will help demand, I think, U.S. from Asia. So we see it coming back some next year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. Can you just talk a little bit, Kurt, maybe about what gives you that confidence in the fourth quarter? If I look at the target range, it seems like you're almost raising the fourth quarter by $0.05. Are you expecting a break after the elections? Do you already see that kicking in? And then just on the confidential letter, was there anything substantial in TNT or should that keep moving forward?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I think we're not expecting a significant rebound in the economy. So this outlook is for kind of steady-as-she-goes economic conditions. We've not seen a real change in momentum sequentially, month-to-month and going into October. We're looking for about 3% volume growth, in aggregate, for the fourth quarter, slightly less than the current momentum. But I think based just on the progress and the execution across all of the business units, we've adapted to the challenging conditions. Certainly, you've seen it with International, and Domestic continues to operate well and -- albeit in a changing environment. So we feel a little more confident, at least, with narrowing the range and clearly being able to deliver a decent fourth quarter.", "D. Scott Davis", "Ken, there are also several positives out there, I think, for the holiday season. Housing is starting to improve. We have lower fuel costs, low interest rates, stock market's been strong. That usually correlates to good consumer behavior. So that helps. Now there are negatives, and I don't want to be repetitive on the fiscal cliff, but sometime about end of November, after the election, fiscal cliff will be front and center, and that will cause some uncertainty. So there are some risks. On the question on TNT, the Statement of Objection is absolutely a normal step in a Phase II merger review. It is expected. It happens in almost all Phase II reviews. So it's -- and it doesn't obviously -- it's basically the EC laying out their position, but it does not prejudge the final outcome. We got a lot of work to do on it. We've been working very closely with the commission over the last several months. We'll continue with the open dialogue. We'll respond in the next couple of weeks. But the document is confidential, and we can't share the details of it at this point in time.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.", "Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I wanted to talk a little bit -- obviously, you guys have been kind of doing this and showing great results on the margin side in terms of kind of \"adjusting the network\" to kind of compensate for the new shipping patterns. Could you talk a little bit more in detail of exactly what you're doing, and then longer term, in terms of the strategy to take advantage of that? And also, how with such a big network, how do you remain flexible? As obviously, we've seen that things change so quickly. How do you make sure that you're always in the right competitive position to take advantage of the changes?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, a lot of pieces to that, Nate. I guess, for starters, the big focus that we have with the changing mix of B2C is really the -- our -- enriching our technology, both for customers and operations, so that we can keep the margins. Myron, maybe you can talk at a high level on some of the things we've been doing.", "Myron A. Gray", "Yes, Kurt. We're in a constant transformation of our business model here in the U.S. to adapt to the changing mode of the market, particularly the B2C. Our use of operational technology has real-time optimization that we'll use moving forward. As you've seen in the past, we've talked specifically about telematics. But moving forward, we'll utilize new delivery route optimization that will give us real-time optimization of the routes that will allow us to reduce the miles driven and direct labor hours.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. And I guess one other real component, if you talk to global network, is our fleet composition and our ability to -- we have a very harmonized young feet. So maybe, Dave Abney, you could talk a little bit about how the airlines' reacting to these trade flows.", "David P. Abney", "Yes, certainly can, Kurt. One thing I want to point out about the third quarter, block hours were down 5%. On an export volume, it increased 1%. And that is certainly due to leveraging Worldport to the strategic composition of our fleet, where we've continued to add 767s, bigger containers and our superior technology. In fact, if you go back 19 -- excuse me, 2008 through 2011, you see that we've actually increased our packages per block hour by 15%, and that just shows that we are leveraging this network. And when it comes to the International side, we have reduced our Asian network, cut it down 10% year-over-year. But as Dan said, as we do have trade lanes that demand it, we certainly will put up block hours as necessary.", "D. Scott Davis", "And I think, historically, we've always shown the ability to perform, I think, in good times and bad times better than most of the industry because we have such a flexible workforce, and we can flex it based on the volume on a daily basis.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Normally, the old rule of thumb used to be that you could get a read on the economy based on what was happening in average weight per piece. Obviously, for reasons B2C, B2B, the lower weight per piece might not necessarily be as accurate an indicator as it used to be. But what's your take on that? And kind of if I look at your average weight per package, how do I segregate what's kind of a structural shift versus maybe cyclical weakness?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. That's a great question, Jeff, and it's the stuff we've been looking at ourselves and trying to isolate. I think if you go back to the more traditional view of weight, which was kind of the indicator of how many widgets are in the box, you could see that packages would get lighter during lean times than heavier. There's a slight weight drop if you look kind of at same-store sales on the B2B for similar industries. So there are certainly -- things continue to get a little smaller, and the economy isn't robust. The vast majority of the weight declines, and we are continuing to see substantial ones, is really this B2B-to-B2C mix. Because we have all of that mixed in the same network, it does create some very big changes in average weight and also is the biggest single driver, by far, of the revenue per piece comps that can be challenging. So our trick is to continue to find creative ways to manage through that, and we're doing pretty well so far.", "D. Scott Davis", "And, Jeff, as -- for the last 20 years, the B2C has become sort of 1% more of the pie each year. In the last probably year, 1.5 years, that pace has picked up to maybe 2% a year more of the pie. So that evolution is speeding up as we speak.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was wondering if you can just clarify something that's in the press release. You talked about International benefiting from improving sort of exports, I think, you said out of Asia, product launches, et cetera. But then supply chain got hurt by overcapacity in Asia. So I'm not sure why you would have differing trends in that regard, and maybe you could talk about what's happened so far in October then.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, absolutely. And Dan Brutto, clearly, can fill you a little more on the product launches but also the balance of Forwarding and our International package business. So, Dan, why don't you take that on?", "Daniel J. Brutto", "Yes, sure. I guess what's happening now primarily in the airfreight market out of Asia is there's overcapacity in the market. Whenever there's overcapacity, even though our kilos are up, certainly, the rates are down, and that's pretty much consistent across the whole forwarding industry. On a positive side though, we did see an uptick in HACTL and PACTL in the month of September. Year-to-date, they're still both down on the export side, HACTL being much more down than PACTL, which is the Hong Kong index versus the Shanghai index. So certainly, we're seeing that. Why the small package? Small package is up because of use of our network and, certainly, some product launches that came out of Asia, as well as some easier comps last year in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Actually, I wanted to follow up on that subject as well. Is there market share gains that you can talk about in tech that maybe helped you disproportionate to your competitors, and then maybe if you can say that the strength that you saw in September has carried into October?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "We're continuing to execute. Clearly, we have a very long history of continued share gains in the international sector. The product launches in September, clearly, was a boost that made September the better growth month. So we're not trying to overplay this. Plus, we've seen sometimes there's a broader ecosystem around product launches. We're peripheral suppliers in some of that launch. So we like to think we're gaining share. Clearly, the profitability was great this quarter. But it's too soon to say that either we or the industry is out of the woods as far as long-term Asia exports.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes. I think we said all year, we expect the third quarter to have easier comps and start seeing better comparisons, and you saw that. So there's really no surprise. I would not say that global exports out of Asia are growing at a fast pace. We have ways to go there.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So, Kurt, with $9 billion in cash on the balance sheet right now, that's obviously well in excess of the TNT acquisition price. Can we assume that that's going to be 100% cash, or will you actually be levering up a little bit to close that deal?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, no. We'll be -- we did do the debt issuance a few weeks ago, and we were just thrilled to see the demand for that. As I said, it was more than 7x oversubscribed. That $1.75 billion really was an early draw to replace debt that comes due in early January. So basically, a couple of billion of that cash and marketable securities is just a pre-funding for that debt. So you take that out, and we're in pretty good shape. We'll use a little commercial paper, as we said. We have some commercial paper outstanding, but we want to be in good position to address the cash needs to close that. So our intentions remain the same as we've said before, that we don't anticipate a need to do any long-term issuance to fund the TNT acquisition.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So the $5 billion in cash number, is that still a good number to think about, or do you think it'll be a little higher than that?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "That's still a good number.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James.", "Arthur W. Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just real quick follow-up on your comments on Europe. You talked about in the press release that while Europe has slowed, your small package growth remains positive. Can you -- and you've talked in the past about how the market is shifting towards small package. Can you talk about that and where you see yourself from the competitive environment, and if any of that positive growth is market share gains within Europe?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, clearly, we're long-term observers of Europe and have operated there for a long time, facilitating the transporter movements. I'll let Dan talk a little about the competitive environment there.", "Daniel J. Brutto", "Yes. I would say that Europe is a very competitive environment. We're slightly up, which is good, but just slightly above positive on the exports for Europe. And certainly, we've reported negative on the domestics, primarily negative on the domestic from the southern periphery countries that are going through austerity programs right now, that they're going through difficulties. So I would say the European market, we're very bullish on Europe, although it is a very competitive marketplace.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I want to ask a question on the Deferred yields in the Domestic side of the business. So they started to step down in fourth quarter of last year, presumably on Amazon Prime. That starts to anniversary in now. So I'm curious, optically, should we expect Deferred to continue to be down, the yield on that business continue to be down year-over-year? And if I can add a compound to that question, when you think about the increasing mix towards B2C, lower weights, lower lane density, how do you add this business on without it being dilutive to overall corporate average returns for the business?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes, I'll talk about the returns issue and then maybe Alan can talk about the market trends and the customer mix change. Clearly, we spend a lot of time focusing on adjusting our domestic network, as Myron talked about, to extract and maintain, by far, the industry's highest returns on capital and, by far, the highest aggregate margins. This growth in lightweight Deferred packages, whether they're B2C, residential or the premium residential packages, does create some different operational challenges, but the returns on capital are very high. They tend not to consume as much in the way of assets. And with our increased focus on the productivity of the last mile that we've been doing, clearly, we're continuing to generate good returns. As far as the yields and the changing mix, we've talked about that a little bit, but Alan can give a little more color to it.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "I guess, first, I wouldn't characterize the lightweight product as any specific customer. We have a broad base of customers that are using the lightweight SurePost product. But it is a relatively new product, and we are going to be lapping some very significant growth in that product. So I think that you should see some yields firm up into 2013 in that regard. And by the way, on the previous question on the -- on weight in general, I think one of the things we've been able to accomplish with the SurePost product is we're now capturing the disproportionate share of that market. That wasn't necessarily a market that we played in even with our Ground residential, and now we're able to go after lightweight, less time-sensitive economic type of products in the marketplace that we weren't necessarily competitive for in the past.", "D. Scott Davis", "And, Peter, we are, as Kurt said, focused on return on invested capital. Our long-term targets have minimum of 25% ROIC 2014 and on. That's based on this mix of products. So we're focused on return on invested capital. We'll keep great ROICs going despite the mix we're looking at here.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.", "Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Can you comment a little bit -- I mean, this was the first quarter where Domestic packages operating income was down for 10 quarters or so, and yet the volume's been so strong. Can you talk a little bit about how much of this has to do with mix with the B2C growing faster and how much of this has to do with maybe trying to take a little more volume and give up a little bit pricing? And then what impact you saw, if any, on fuel? It's hard to tell the expense is down year-over-year, but obviously, so is the fuel surcharge.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. Sure, Ed. Let me -- I'll be glad to unfold that for you a little bit. The 2 most notable issues that were headwinds in the third quarter, and frankly, we guided at least some of those last quarter, the first was the fuel surcharge lag, which I think we did estimate was about $60 million. In addition, there was a one less good working day this quarter, which, as a ballpark, we usually say that's about $50 million, plus or minus, per working day. So if you factor those 2 in, we did also say in Q2, we had a $60 million tailwind for fuel. So if you average out those 2 quarters, you can actually see the business trends remain fairly stable, and we would have shown solid increases in profits. So we feel that things are working pretty well. We knew third quarter was going to be a challenge. That's part of why we had to talk a little more about that last quarter. The mix -- changing mix is a challenge that we're continuing to work through, but we feel pretty good so far. So in general, we think the business is steady in the U.S. The operational enhancements are helping to offset the challenges that we're facing with the lighter weight packages, and we expect that to continue.", "D. Scott Davis", "Ed, we expect to see, obviously, Domestic operating profit improvement in the fourth quarter at a margin of 15% or over. So we feel like we're moving in the right direction there.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just on the U.S. Domestic small package side. I guess from what I've heard, at least it sounded like the workaround on some of the large customer impact sounds more operational in terms of how you guys are thinking about this and taking costs out of the network to try to offset some of that negative mix impact. But I mean, when you think about that business, how actively are you pushing back or managing volumes with those customers to make sure that, that mix is appropriate? Or does it really just take a reinvigoration, to your point, Scott, with fiscal cliff worries and all of that on the small- to medium-sized customers to start coming back and adding growth to that mix in order to see a more, I guess, healthy yield profile coming out of that business?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "I think no. The -- clearly, we've talked a lot about the cost and the technology enhancements, but equally important is the revenue management and extracting the value from all of these new capabilities. So, Alan, maybe you can talk a little bit about how we're enhancing on the revenue side.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. So it's certainly noteworthy that on year-on-year basis, that the product and the customer mix continues to negatively impact the yields. And again, I think a lot of those base rate improvements are being masked by the continued growth in lightweight products. But clearly, the portfolio we have out there, whether it's for B2B customers or B2C customers, allows them to certainly optimize their transportation and pick the service that they need at the -- provide the service they need at a cost point they're looking for. The other thing I would just add is that the core pricing certainly remains firm, around 2.5% base price increase, a little bit stronger on the Air side.", "D. Scott Davis", "Justin, to your point on small-, medium-sized enterprises is a focal point for UPS. I know Myron and Alan's teams are looking for different ways to go to that market, I think. They have not been spending. They have not been stocking inventory. They have not been hiring because of all the certainly out there, and they will get it going once the government makes some decisions. But we are bringing a lot more solutions to this group. I think solutions originally were focused to the larger companies, larger businesses. Now we're bringing those solutions to the small- and medium-sized companies, which will help us grow the middle market going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Kurt, I want to let you know that my wife is taking your advice and is indulging in some online holiday shopping these days.", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "That's great. Just got to make sure she signs up for My Choice, Kevin.", "Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Yes. Kind of talking about this question of shifting International patterns. Have you kind of seen any major shifts in International shipping patterns, say, from the Air to the Ocean or is it mainly to Deferred products?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Certainly, we've seen shifts geographically quite a bit with some of the intercontinental moves slowing, which we've talked about for a couple of quarters. I'll let Dan maybe add a little color on what we're seeing in our Forwarding unit and express.", "Daniel J. Brutto", "Yes. I wouldn't say -- the answer to that, I've seen -- we've seen some nontraditional Ocean customers. And what I mean is some airfreight and some express taking, at least, a look at sending some of their lower-margin products via Ocean. And we've made it easy for those customers, certainly, with our broad portfolio and also with our preferred less-than-container-load Ocean product that lets the customer, either from the high tech or the medical field, at least test out Ocean in a way that is quick and certainly allows them to move along this product portfolio on an efficient manner, but nothing to a major extent yet in the marketplace.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes. Back to geography that Kurt talked about, clearly, the European demand is down. That's impacting the Asia exports and U.S. exports pretty dramatically as we move forward. So hopefully, we can get some European imports going again in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You highlighted that you've already opened discussions with the Teamsters here. So can you just talk about some of the objectives that you're looking to accomplish with this new contract round, especially in the face of the shifting mix domestically to more B2C traffic, more of the lightweight, lower-yielding packages?", "D. Scott Davis", "I will let Dave Abney talk about that. He probably won't be able to tell you an awful lot because we're keeping the negotiations at the table.", "David P. Abney", "All right. Yes, the negotiations did start in September, and we do believe that the early start is good for the employees, customers and the shareholders. In the past 2 negotiations, we have been able to reach early conclusions. We've got a positive relationship with the Teamsters. We both recognize that UPS success translates into jobs. Many of the issues that come up have been discussed over the last couple of years through the competition committee. As far as the particular issues, we just believe negotiations are best left at the bargaining table, so we won't reveal that today. But we're satisfied with the pace of discussions.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose.", "Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just one point of clarification. Did you say how many people you would need to hire for the peak shipping season or -- and how that compares to prior years?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "No. We'll be releasing more details about the peak season and the holidays in a couple of weeks or so. As Alan said, we do expect over 0.5 billion packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we'll be very busy, and there'll be plenty of temporary hires that start with the company, like myself, during the holidays. But we'll give you more details in a couple of weeks.", "D. Scott Davis", "Will you be driving during the holidays?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "If I need to.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson, Davis.", "David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company", "I'm just a little surprised that you're relatively optimistic about the fourth quarter Forwarding unit, given the fact that you're a little unsure about September's volume growth continuing in the Asia Pacific region. What changed from -- what changes from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that allows you to be optimistic that earnings will be up in that division year-to-year?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "David, that's good question. I wouldn't interpret our guidance to be optimism, specifically around the International Forwarding. More important than that segment, as far as contributing to profit improvements, is our UPS Freight and our Distribution business. So no, we expect Forwarding to have another challenging quarter. Clearly, the buy rates are low but the revenues are also being pushed down quite a bit. So it's more an expression of optimism of the continued momentum in our Freight and in our Distribution business, which is benefiting from the healthcare growth.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Dan, I guess to that point, can you talk a little bit about gross profit per unit, both on the Air Freight side and on the Ocean Freight side, here in the third quarter relative to the second quarter and then maybe what the expectations are as we go into the fourth, and then wrapping again -- discussing the competitiveness of the Forwarding environment in the light of available capacity but continued weakness in volumes?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. We did see some margin compression quarter-over-quarter. Clearly, we didn't quite hit the overall segment margin that we'd hope. We hoped to get to 9% this quarter and ended up coming in still at a healthy 8.3%, and the biggest driver of that was the margins on the Forwarding. We don't disclose the exact margins of our Ocean and Air Forwarding. Clearly, the Ocean has been actually doing a little better than the Air Forwarding since that's an industry-wide trend. And as Dan mentioned, with our less-than-container-load in expedited Ocean, we're finding what we think is a profitable niche. So we think the quarter -- fourth quarter will again be a challenging one for the -- for all of the forwarders, frankly.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.", "John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Quick question on the subject of B2B and B2C and that ratio. Is there any seasonality in the fluctuation in those ratios of traffic, or are you starting to see B2B -- or B2C, I'm sorry, being more consistent level of your business? I know, Scott, you said it was growing at 2% of the pie or whatever. But is that, quarter-to-quarter, very consistent, or are you seeing some seasonality in it?", "D. Scott Davis", "I think as far as the evolution, B2B to B2C, it's pretty steady. But clearly, the fourth quarter holiday season, B2C has a bigger piece of the mix, as it always is during Christmas season.", "John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes. But the -- yes, I'm sorry. I -- But the other 3 quarters, 1Q through 3Q, is it still very consistent among those 3 quarters, taking out 4Q?", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, it's pretty consistent.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "There's the article that came out highlighting Walmart's experimentation with same-day delivery a couple of weeks ago and that they're using UPS to deliver to their customers' homes. Could you comment a little bit on that project and whether or not you're doing same-day delivery with others, and whether you think same-day delivery is actually a viable method that people are going to be using and if you're going to be able to charge enough to account for the delivery density problems with same-day delivery?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Great, good question. I'll let Alan talk about some of those areas of innovation.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Clearly, there's a heck of a lot going on in the B2C market. Certainly, SurePost postal injection is one of those areas what UPS is doing, with UPS My Choice is another, and certainly, a lot of noise out there with same-day type delivery options. I think it's really still too early to tell precisely how that's going to shape up, but that's really an incubating part of the market at this time. I think more importantly is what the retailers are looking at out there and what UPS is helping them do in terms of what is being called like omni-channel out there. So we're out there helping both e-tailers and e-tailers with brick-and-mortar leverage all the assets they have. And what you're seeing now is retailers that want to fulfill directly from their store to consumer or fulfill from their dot.coms directly to their stores and create an ecosystem out there, where customers have the maximum access and the maximum number of options out there. And I think another area is if you can fulfill from a store and provide customer a late pickup, then you can get next-day delivery or near same-day delivery with the late pickup.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I noticed you opened a few more healthcare distribution facilities and wondering if you can give some color on what portion of Forwarding and Logistics is in the healthcare distribution area. And also, sort of in the current laboratory of economic uncertainty, what sort of performance you're seeing from your healthcare logistics relative to the cyclicality and uncertainty of sort of the broader market?", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Well, we did see healthcare grow approximately 20% from a revenue perspective, especially in those locations where we do a part of the distribution also. We don't share exact numbers, but I think the great thing about healthcare is that it's an industry that really makes full utilization of the integrated network and the broad portfolio of UPS. So Dan even mentioned, in some cases, healthcare customers are using Ocean. Clearly, our Air Freight Forwarding and temperature control configuration and our express services all come together. So it is an industry where we can really stretch our wings and take advantage of the entire portfolio.", "D. Scott Davis", "And the revenue shows up in Domestic package, International package, obviously Freight, Forwarding, Distribution, so across-the-board.", "Daniel J. Brutto", "And we have now 5 million square feet of healthcare facilities around the world and 36 facilities. And just these last few months, we've opened 3 in Asia for around 400,000 square feet. So it's a growing part of our business.", "Operator", "Our next question will be a follow-up from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. Scott, I figured you might be disappointed if you didn't get at least a second question on TNT. So I'll try to give you one more on that. I think there have been -- there's been a lot of noise about what the EC is going to do and the idea that they are being really granular in how they're defining markets, that, that might be a challenge. Is there any kind of a high-level comments you can give us in terms of the SO? Did this end up being a bit more challenging, more stringent than you would've expected? Would you say, at the end of the day, it's pretty reasonable what you have in there? Can you kind of shade it in terms of being a little better or a little worse than you would've expected on the SO?", "D. Scott Davis", "I think that it's a complex transaction. And whenever you get into Phase II, you spent a lot of time with the Commission, and our team has spent a lot of time with Commission. I think it's been good, open dialogue. I think we're exchanging information. We got a ways to go. And certainly, we just got the SO Friday night. So we're obviously going through that right now. Over next couple of weeks, we'll spend a lot of time responding to that. I know Dan Brutto has spent a lot of the last couple of months in Europe on this project. Any comments, Dan?", "Daniel J. Brutto", "Yes, sure. I think what I could say is we both have -- they have a case team. We have a team that's working constructively. As Scott said, it's very complex. It's all the 27 member states of the EU that they're tasked with taking a hard look at, and it's just part of the process. The SO is part of the process. We'll go through that. We'll have our response back. But the good news is the team have -- the teams have open dialogue, and certainly, we're going to turn in the documents that is required by the Commission within the timeframe.", "D. Scott Davis", "And we're confident we'll get clearance and we'll get it early in 2013, and we're committed to the transaction.", "Operator", "Due to time constraints, our last question will be a follow-up from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes. I just wanted to ask, we used to talk about B2C being around 1/3 of the business. I'm curious where it is. You just mentioned it sort of accelerated as a percent of the pie. Where does it ultimately top out at? Because I would sort of think at some point, you'd rather say like, \"Look, let's just start raising prices on this stuff more aggressively because we don't want too much of it given the mix affect.\"", "Kurt P. Kuehn", "Yes. Certainly, it's our goal to optimize the value, create the premium services, either by speed or by My Choice and, at same time, for those lightweight, low-value products to keep prices down. Right now, B2B is -- or B2C is running about 40%. And clearly, given the holidays, it'll be significantly over 50%. But we hope that the core B2B economy also picks up and so the balance remains healthy, although we'll take whatever the market gives us and find a way to be profitable and generate good returns for it.", "D. Scott Davis", "And, Bill, we adjust. 80 to 90 years ago, B2C was 100% of our business. So we will adjust based on how the market changes.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Andy Dolny.", "Andy Dolny", "Yes, I'm going to turn it to Scott for some closing comments.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Unfortunately, global trade continues to be slower than any of us would like at this point in time. But I think UPS has made the necessary adjustments. You started to see it in the third quarter results. I think we did a nice turnaround in International. We're going in the right direction. But in the fourth quarter, we actually expect to hit on all cylinders. Each segment anticipates operating profit improvement with margin equal to or better than last year. This is not only a testament of UPS business model, but also the capabilities and dedication of the UPS team.", "Thanks so much for joining us today, and we'll see you next quarter.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Stephen and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. The floor is yours, sir.Andy DolnyGood morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney; International President, Dan Brutto; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Alan Gershenhorn, UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer.Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2011 Form 10-K and 2012 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.During our third quarter earnings call in October, I explained that if interest rates remain low, UPS would likely record a sizable pension mark-to-market charge in the fourth quarter. Interest rates did remain low and although the plans exceeded their expected rate of return, that benefit was more than offset by the 120 basis point decline in average year-end discount rates. Under GAAP, UPS is required to use portfolio of double A bonds to calculate our pension plan discount rates. In 2011, there were many double A bonds of financial institutions that were part of the portfolio calculation. In 2012, some of the bonds of financial institutions were downgraded and therefore excluded from our portfolio. While the spreads on the ones that remained compressed at a much greater rate than corporate bonds.These two factors, the change in the bond portfolio mix and the compression in the spreads to treasuries resulted in a significant drop in our average discount rate. This led to a non-cash mark-to-market after-tax charge of $3 billion on our company sponsored pension and post-retirement benefit plans for 2012. As a result, on a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were reduced by $3.15. Keep in mind this charge does not affect UPS cash flow, benefits paid to plan participants, or required pension funding. In fact, over the next three years, required pension contributions for UPS are significantly less than the previous three years.Ignoring the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.32. To provide additional information on the mark-to-market accounting process, we have posted a tutorial on the IR website which includes a sensitivity analysis that illustrates the impact of changes in discount rates. For example, a 100 basis point increase in discount rates could result in a mark-to-market gain.In our remarks today, we will refer to UPS fourth quarter 2012 results excluding the impact of the mark-to-market charge. Additionally, all 2012 full-year references and comparisons to 2011 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are included in this schedules that accompanies our earnings news release. These schedules along with a webcast of today's call are available on the UPS investor relations website.A couple of reminders. Any guidance that we provide for 2013 does not include expenses related to our attempted acquisition of TNT. And, finally, each of you will be allowed to ask one question and then get back into queue for follow up. Thanks for your cooperation.Now, let me turn it over to Scott.Scott Davis", "Thanks Andy and good morning. I hope that everyone had a safe and happy holiday season.Despite an environment of sluggish global trade that existed for most of 2012 and increase in uncertainty in the U.S created by the November elections and the fiscal cliff, UPS executed well. Although we fell short of our goals for the year, we did achieve record earnings per share. Our U.S domestic business led the way. We continue to see robust growth in residential shipments as the UPS portfolio provides a rapidly growing e-commerce market with unequaled solutions. Whether it\u2019s putting goods in consumers\u2019 hands the next day, or through more economical products like UPS SurePost, we are getting the job done.Though we\u2019ve been around for more than 100 years, things never stand still at UPS and 2012 was definitely a year filled with opportunities and challenges. Our bid to acquire TNT Express is probably the first to come to mind. It would be an understatement to say we\u2019re disappointed by the decision of the European Commission to block the acquisition. UPS essentially put all hands on deck to get this deal done over the last year. I\u2019d like to thank the many UPSers around the world who worked tirelessly on this project. We will of course continue to pursue growth opportunities, both organic and through acquisitions. While we view the TNT transaction as part of a compelling growth platform and it consumed a lot of internal resources, we are moving on.Our financial strength enables UPS to evaluate future prospects as well as continue to invest in our portfolio. The UPS vision and focus centers on four transformative strategies; deploying technology enabled operations; providing unique industry specific customer solutions; expanding our global network; and finally, serving the needs of end consumers around the world.In fact during 2012 and early 2013, we have launched powerful new, all enhanced services as we continue to invest for growth to support the needs of our customers. For example we expanded the footprint of UPS Next Day Air Service in the U.S and today, UPS delivers to more businesses and zip codes overnight by 8:30 a.m. and 10:30 than anyone. Our forwarding unit added innovative supply chain management technology like UPS Order Watch.Most recently we launched the new UPS Worldwide Express Freight Service for heavy airfreight. It offers a seamless experience between shipping express packages and express freight. And finally, UPS further developed capabilities through new and expanded healthcare sites around the world and through operating facility expansions like our Cologne Hub, which is on track to be completed in 2013.On the labor front, UPS started negotiations early with the Teamsters and we continue to be engaged in productive discussions. Things are progressing and we look forward to an early conclusion.Regarding 2013, the global economic environment shows that we remain in a cycle of mixed growth and mixed signals. I\u2019ve talked to a number of customers and it\u2019s clear that fiscal uncertainty continues to erode business confidence and growth prospects. This will continue until Washington starts to compromise and make decisions in some key areas. Yet I must admit that in the U.S, we were off to a surprisingly strong start in January.In Europe there has been some improvement. Forecast for Germany and the U.K are better, while the Netherlands and Poland are worse. But clearly, we\u2019re starting 2013 in Europe in a more stable situation than last year. Asia\u2019s GDP forecasts have also improved.In the fourth quarter, global trade returned to more normal trends and expectations are for that to continue. I\u2019m confident that whatever the global trade environment is, our people will deliver. UPS is made up of hundreds of thousands of dedicated employees. I want to thank UPSers for their efforts during 2012 and I\u2019m proud of how our people rose to the challenges they faced. I want to give special recognition to those who went the extra mile in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy, UPSers stepping up to lend a hand in a time of crisis. Great job.Regardless of external uncertainty, UPS is not waiting around for change. We are leveraging our growth strategies to adapt and prosper. We intend to maintain our high standard for earnings, return on invested capital and free cash flow. And UPS is confident in our ability to achieve the long-term targets we defined at our 2011 Industrial Conference. Now before Kurt covers the financials, David Abney will share information on our peak season.David AbneyThanks, Scott. Holiday retail sales came in slightly below expectations but UPS still hit a new high, delivering over 500 million packages globally during peak season. Our air business was especially strong and reflected the trust customers place on the speed and effectiveness of UPS. On our peak air day, Christmas eve, UPS delivered over 8 million air packages, more than 2.5 times our normal air volume and over 1 million pieces more than last year. Processing this many packages makes having the UPS integrated global network all the more beneficial.Over the years, we have made strategic capital investments to expand Worldport, modernize our fleet, and develop state of the art technologies like telematics and next generation small sorts. These investments give UPS a competitive advantage and are one of the keys to success. Our innovative technologies combined with the best people in the business, enabled us to deliver peak season volume more efficiently than ever before. Offer innovative services like UPS My Choice, which increases operational performance and enhances the customer experience and manage complex operating plans during two distinct volume surges, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the two weeks before Christmas.We are even seeing a third spike develop. One to manage the post sales process where the UPS returns portfolio is well positioned to capture growth. Since the financial community loves numbers, here are few more stats for you. Volume on peak day December 19, was almost 28 million packages. And on six days we delivered over 25 million. Our busiest tracking day was December 18, when more than 65 million tracking requests occurred. And my favorite as COO, efficiency metrics. In the U.S. where daily volumes grew by 3%, miles driven were up 1.2% and direct labor hours were up 2.3%.On the air side, U.S. Next Day Air grew almost 8%, while block hours were up only 1.6%. International exports improved over 5% yet international block hours declined 1%. UPS efficiency is nothing new. For example, since 2008 U.S. domestic volume handled per block hour has increased more than 20%. This is just the way we run our business. We don\u2019t wait to implement big operations initiatives. UPS seeks incremental improvements everyday year after year. So as you can see, UPS airline operations are as productive as ever and this positions us for growth and better returns to our investors.Finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize the more than 20,000 employees of the UPS airline. You may not know this, but it was 25 years ago tomorrow that UPS airlines operated its first revenue flight when aircraft tail number, N880UP, a DC-8 flew from Louisville to Milwaukee. In August of that year, UPS announced plans to form its own airline. And it became the fastest startup in FAA history. So congratulations and thanks to all of you who made it possible. Now I will turn things over to Kurt to discuss the financial highlights.Kurt Kuehn", "Well, thanks David and good morning everyone. On a consolidated basis UPS fundamentals are strong as ever. We wrapped up the year with free cash flow of approximately $5.4 billion and although we feel short of our target for the year, UPS generated record earnings per share of $4.53. This was achieved in the face of weak global trade and in spite of superstorm Sandy which cost us about $0.05 a share.UPS annual revenue of $54.1 billion was our highest ever, as were the 4.1 billion packages we delivered globally. Pricing improvements, along with the efficiencies that David highlighted, led to margin expansion. For the quarter, consolidated package volume grew 3% per day. Revenue of $14.6 billion set a record as did operating profit at $2 billion.While the U.S domestic segment improved profitability, international experienced a slight decline and faced with a margin squeeze in forwarding, the supply chain and freight segment also exhibited lower profit.Now let\u2019s review our results in detail, starting with the U.S domestic segment. In the U.S, we fired on all cylinders. Operating profit was nearly $1.4 billion, a new high. Average daily volume grew 3% with Next Day Air up almost 8% and Ground up 3%, driven by expansion in B2C shipments.Despite slightly weaker than forecast holiday retail sales, shoppers went online like never before. We experienced strong growth in Next Day Air Saver and traditional UPS Ground and of course our lightweight solution SurePost, was also popular this holiday season. We continued to see strong growth there, even though we wrapped last year\u2019s rollout of this product.Revenue for the segment grew 3%, with Next Day Air and Ground up 5.4% and 3.4% respectively. Revenue per piece increased 1.7%, driven by base rate improvements in both Ground and Air. As a result of increased demand for our Saver products, Next Day Air revenue per piece declined 60 basis points.Operating profit of almost $1.4 billion was up 4.4% and operating margin expanded to 15.4%. Hurricane Sandy was a challenge in the quarter, but our operations expertise and integrated network mitigated some of its impact. In addition, rising healthcare benefit costs continues to be a headwind, but its impact on the quarter was partially offset by some onetime items.Moving on to our international segment, UPS delivered 1.1 million export packages per day, up 5.5%, although that was boosted about 1% by global operating day differences. Leading the growth was Asia, where export volume grew in the mid-teens, aided strongly by tech sector product launches.During the quarter, export revenue per piece declined 3.5% on a currency neutral basis. Typically, Asia growth would be a great story, but during the holidays this growth was concentrated in lower weight packages from high volume shippers using less premium products.Europe exports improved as a result of growth in non-premium products. Companies there continue to streamline their supply chains and lever UPS solutions to meet their needs. Germany, Italy and the U.K all showed solid export increases. We are confident in the opportunities created by a developing European small package market and we\u2019ll continue to aggressively pursue growth strategies there.Domestic revenue in the international segment increased 1.3% on flat daily volume growth. Revenue per piece increased more than 4% on a currency neutral basis, reflecting our focus on revenue management.Overall, total UPS international revenue grew 1.5% to $3.2 billion. Operating profit was $499 million, down slightly. Changes in customer and product mix lowered profits. However, operating margin of 15.6% continues to set the bar in the industry. Acquisition related expenses of approximately $30 million were higher than anticipated and negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.01 more than originally expected.Now for supply chain and freight. Revenue increased 4% over last year to $2.4 billion. Our forwarding and logistics group improved $40 million or 2.5%, while UPS freight revenue increased by $39 million or 6.2%. In the forwarding business, tonnage and yield improvements led to revenue growth, though this growth was somewhat offset by reductions in other transportation solutions. Increases in transportation expense were a challenge for profit. In the Asia air freight market there was a short term volume surge which exceeded capacities and drove up buy rates. As a result our margin was squeezed and profit declined. However, UPS Ocean products did very well. ", "Revenue and profit increased year-over-year and the popularity of our less than container load offering exceeded expectations. The UPS distribution business increased revenue by providing healthcare and high-tech customers effective solutions to better manage their supply chains. In fact, healthcare revenue increased by more than (inaudible). During the quarter we opened three new healthcare facilities and more are scheduled for 2013.At UPS Freight, LTL revenue was up 6.5% and gross weight hauled increased by almost five. For the quarter, operating margin was similar to last year and overall for the year margin expanded by 70 basis points. Let me shift gears and spend a moment on pensions. First, a reminder that the mark-to-market charge that Andy spoke about does not affect UPS cash flow, benefits paid to plan participants or required pension funding. Funding requirements for UPS sponsored pension plans were modified by recent legislation and as a result UPS plans are fully funded and we have no required cash contributions in 2013.As for pension expense in 2013, the lower discount rates do cause higher service and interest costs. As a result, we expect pension expense for these plans to increase about $225 million compared to last year. This will be a significant drag in 2013 although when discount rates go back up, we will see decreases in pension expense. Looking now at our cash and balance sheet.During 2012, UPS generated $5.4 billion in free cash flow after capital expenditures of $2.2 billion. We ended the year with almost $8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Although keep in mind that $1.75 billion has already been used this month to pay up maturing debt. For the year, UPS paid $2.1 billion in dividends, an increase of 9.6% per share. In addition, we repurchased 21.8 million shares for approximately $1.6 billion. Looking ahead to 2013, UPS expects strong free cash flow to continue, again exceeding 100% of net income.As a result of our strong financial position and reflecting our commitment to share on the distributions, UPS is increasing our 2013 guidance for share repurchases by an additional $2.5 billion, up to a total of $4 billion. As always, dividends will also continue to be a priority. Looking at guidance beyond cash, as Scott alluded to, the global economic shows that we remain in the cycle of mixed recovery with more improvement in some places than others. We are confident that the strategies outlined by Scott position UPS well. As a result, we expect another good year of earnings growth. We are anticipating earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $5.06, an increase of 6% to 12%.Looking at the segments. For the full year, U.S. domestic average daily volume is projected to grow around 2% to 3%, slightly above GDP estimates. Revenue is expected to be up mid-single digits with base rate improvements of 2% to 3%. We are pleased with the momentum in our domestic business although UPS does expect increased healthcare and pension expense to limit margin expansion. We anticipate an operating margin approaching 14%, resulting in profit growth at a mid-single digit pace. In our international business, UPS expects revenue to increase at a mid-single digit rate with domestic and export daily volume growing faster than global GDP.Exports yields will continue to be pressured by both changing customer mix and increased reliance on non-premium products. We expect operating margin will expand slightly in spite of an estimated currency headwind of $125 million. In supply chain and freight, for the full year, we expect revenue to increase at a mid to high single-digit pace with some margin expansion, resulting in profit growth of approximately 10%. The segment is expected to maintain a strong operating margin of at least 8%, despite continued investments in healthcare solutions and facilities.Looking specifically at expectations for first quarter, there are a number of items that will negatively impact year-over-year comparisons, most notably, one less operating day and the timing of an early Easter. Even though UPS expects full year earnings per share growth in the range of 6% to 12%, for the first quarter, we anticipate that earnings per share growth will be relatively flat. Reviewing segments for the first quarter, both U.S domestic and international are expected to generate results similar to Q1 of last year. Supply chain and freight profits end margins should be down on a year-over-year basis because of investments in technology and the gain recognized last year on the sale of the surplus facility.To wrap up the income statement, our overall tax rate for 2013 should be between 34% and 35%. Regarding CapEx, for the full year, we expect our spending to be $2.4 billion, keeping us at approximately 4% of revenue.In summary, 2012 had its challenges. UPS set some records, but we also fell short in some areas. We are always constructively dissatisfied at UPS, seeking to attain new highs and this year will be no different. Despite another year of mixed global economic conditions, and approximately $350 million in headwinds from pension and currency, UPS will continue to raise the bar, with expected full year earnings per share growth of 6% to 12%. And as Scott mentioned earlier, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the UPS long term target of 10% to 15% earnings per share growth.Thanks and now we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Our first question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Justin B. Yagerman \u2013 Deutsche Bank AGGood morning guys. Wanted to reconcile the guidance and the commentary on the economy in the press release to Scott your early remarks behind how the economy is trending here in the beginning of 2013. It felt like guidance was potentially a little bit conservative here. Kurt, you did a good job running through some of the assumptions, but is it really just the weakness on international yields and the $350 million of headwinds that get you nervous? Or you do see anything else from an economic standpoint that really gives you some pause here in the early part of the year?Scott DavisJustin, let me start. I think that overall we still see 2013 as a slow growth economy. I think that the good signs that I talked about is I think you see a more stable Europe than we saw a year ago. We\u2019re starting to see a pickup in global trade which is very important for us as we look forward. The second and third quarters of 2012 we saw global trade lag, the global economic growth which is very unusual. So it feels like that\u2019s getting more normal. In the U.S, as I said I think we got off to a strong start in January. I think a variety of reasons for that. I think with the trends the last few years we\u2019ve seen strong last weeks of December, early January due to I think gift card purchases after Christmas due to a lot of returns.Yesterday\u2019s GDP number said that obviously the inventories were very low. So I think we\u2019re seeing restocking of inventories early in January. But I\u2019m still cautious as we move through the year that I do think we\u2019ll see growth in the U.S, though we still are going to be addressing the debt ceiling in the second quarter. More than likely that\u2019s going to cause some uncertainty. So we have some challenges. As far as the guidance, the big number I think is the drag due to pension and currency and the pension is out of your control. Low discount rates, it had a big impact and that\u2019s impacts earnings by about 5%. So you take that and add that to the 6% to 12% guidance, it would have been a very strong guidance without those headwinds.Kurt Kuehn", "Yeah. I think that the basic expectations are that the U.S economy will be somewhere around 2% and global GDP somewhere around 2.5%. So certainly not a barn burner year. We expect under trend performance and as Scott said, the pension could just as easily turn around next year and if we get 100 basis point increase in the discount rate that would be a $200 million tailwind.Justin B. Yagerman \u2013 Deutsche Bank AGWhat are you guys looking forward to get more excited this year in terms of economic signs? And what are you seeing out of Asian airfreight? That\u2019s been a place of particular weakness. Didn\u2019t hear too much on that.Kurt Kuehn", "We certainly some getting resolution in Washington to some extent will be a big deal. So consumer confidence pulling through with the activities in DC. I will turn it over maybe to Dan Brutto, our President of International, to talk a little bit about the trends we are seeing in Asia.Daniel BruttoYeah, I guess the Asia trends really are -- right now you have got a lot of large hi-tech customers that have send out product launches. But after the first of the year, they are getting more positive in Asia. Also the area of somewhat concern is, is folks are using less premium products in Asia. The Chinese New Year is also later this year, it\u2019s in the first week, almost the second week of February. So right now we are off to a good start, as Scott said, in January. So we expect Asia to come back. The tail of the tape will be how we will come back to customers in the middle market where we have provided a lot of solutions for start utilizing premium products to take care of this inventory shortage that we know is in the marketplace.Kurt KuehnLet me just add, I think a more stable Europe will also aid in Asia exports which were very negative last year up until the fourth quarter and in U.S. exports. I mean, that certainly has had a big drag on U.S. exports in 2012. So, as Europe stabilizes and begin buying goods again, that will be good for exports.Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Tom Wadewitz - JPMorganI wanted to ask you the mix. So Dan, just talked about how that\u2019s been of a headwind in international but can you help me think about mix both domestic, if you have growth in B2C. And how much that affects your margin view? Is that something that maybe makes you a little bit cautious on margin in domestic? And then from an international perspective, how material is that impact on your international margins? Can you deal pretty well with growth in less than premium products or is that a material factor to consider in our margin beyond international?Scott DavisYeah, Tom, I think on the domestic side we have really saw all of 2012 as a year where B2C was really at the lead that our B2B business was relatively flat, just up slightly in the fourth quarter and really that continuing process of direct to consumer was a big factor. And even in that environment and even with the headwind of Sandy, we did show margin improvements in the U.S. So is B2C a little tougher than B2B, yes, it is. On the other hand, Myron, and the deployment of technology enabled operations has made us, we think, able to profitably grow with that.On the international side, we have got -- in Europe we have got great Pan-European capabilities. The yields on our express volume certainly are higher than the standard. But we think we can manage through those things. The big product launch is certainly something that does distort margin a little bit because those are high revenue, relatively low yielding products. So those probably have more to do with any disruption that you saw in the trends.David AbneyI guess on the international front as far as margins are concerned, if you take a look at the last quarter, we really take a close look at the domestic to make sure that we maintain our margins in the domestic business and we serve essentially those customers that are importers and exporters. For our export product internationally, we do very well with B2C as well as B2B. In fact, certainly even in the tough economy in the fourth quarter, a 15.6 margin continues to be industry-leading by a significant amount. We expect that to continue in the future.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.David Vernon - Sanford C. BernsteinSo the increased guidance for buyback, so it\u2019s $4 billion for 2013. It\u2019s still going to leave you with quite a bit of cash on the balance sheet. Can you talk about kind of future plans for that capital as well as how you think about growth going forward in a world without the TNT acquisition?Kurt KuehnYeah, I guess if you are looking at the year-end balance sheet, clearly, we did payback a large debt issuance that came in due in January, as I referenced to. So about $1.75 billion of cash was used for that. Now, we are stepping back up our repurchase scenario. We pulled back on that in light of the big commitment of the TNT acquisition and we are certainly getting back on track with that. The $4 billion basically catches up the shortfall that we had in 2012 because of us being a little more conservative. As far as use of cash in the future, I will turn it over to Scott to talk about that.Scott DavisWell, I think, David, the game plan is we will keep a balanced use of cash going forward. We will continue to increase distributions to shareowners. We will review dividend policy here in a couple of weeks. So we had a board meeting for 2013 and clearly we will reinvest in the business. We think there are opportunities out there in the emerging new markets there\u2019s opportunities out there and the supply chain world we\u2019re doing a lot more in healthcare these days. So we\u2019ll have opportunities to reinvest via acquisition route also.David Vernon - Sanford C. BernsteinSo there is a possibility then for some other inorganic stuff to come up in priority?Scott DavisYeah, absolutely there\u2019s a possibility. We\u2019re always looking for opportunities out there. There won\u2019t be things the size of TNT likely, but there\u2019ll be opportunities for us to reinvest in the business.David Vernon - Sanford C. BernsteinAnd would that be core package or would you think more supply chain and freight?Andy DolnyDavid, we\u2019re going to try to limit the questions to get everybody on the call. We\u2019ll answer this one and then I\u2019ll ask to be your last question.Scott DavisI think we\u2019ve always said that our priorities are international package looking as far as we can expand the network. That stays a priority. Certainly in the forwarding and distribution world we see opportunities, namely in healthcare. So I think nothing has changed as far as the outlook there.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.Benjamin J. Hartford \u2013Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.Good morning. Dan, maybe you could address a little bit about international capacity on the airfreight side at the moment. I know you guys took delivery of seven aircraft in 2012. Are you expecting or can you talk maybe about the expected timeline of the eight remaining deliveries of the 767? And then more broadly, can you talk about the dynamics on capacity in these key trade lanes from a dedicated freight of perspective as well as from some of the passenger aircraft and maybe where we stand from an equilibrium perspective? Thanks.Kurt KuehnI\u2019ll turn it over to David Abney to talk about the airline deliveries and the overall global network.David AbneyAs far as the 767s that we\u2019re receiving this year, we\u2019re going to receive eight. We look to put seven of them in the domestic routes, one in international. As far as the international flying, just due to the fragile global economics, we\u2019re managing the network very closely by bid period. So, we\u2019re making those adjustments every eight weeks or so.Daniel BruttoI guess I would say on the international arena, our capacity and utilization of aircraft has never been better and certainly as David said, we want to utilize our planes. With our hybrid network, we actually on the forwarding business can move a lot of our freight into the commercial market. In fact for every five kilos that we pick up in our forwarding business, four kilos goes on another carrier\u2019s aircraft. About one kilo goes on a UPS aircraft. That\u2019s very good because when the economy flexes either up or down, we can move more premium or more freight into our own network to make sure that that\u2019s fully utilized as well as optimizing the use of commercial aircraft.Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AGGood morning. Just wanted to get a clarification on the guidance and then a question about the pension. The guidance, does the 480 to 506 include the expected reduction in your share count associated with the $4 billion buyback?Kurt KuehnYeah, it would. That reflects the expected $4 billion spread over the year reasonably ratably and also includes the expectation of the pension increase and others. So that\u2019s all in. what it doesn\u2019t include is any expenses from the TNT, either the freight fee or the substantial amount of legal and internal resources that we\u2019ve deployed.Scott DavisJust to remind you, the share buyback does benefit earnings growth by about 2%. The pension and currency drags earnings growth by about 5% in that guidance range.Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of BofA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchGood morning. If we could just follow up on the international side again, as you noted you continue to improve efficiency, but how do you think about that as the international margins continue to fall? I know that you said they were at solid levels relative to industry, but are there things you can do to continue to get that back on track? Or is that as you watch these new super saver products continue to deteriorate that over time?Scott DavisKen, certainly before Dan talks about it, I guess we do have to take the results of the international business with some perspective that we\u2019ve been involved over the last couple of quarters with the largest projects in company history and a very large number of resources and people have been involved in the TNT acquisition. So as Dan takes a breath and his people get focused on the future, clearly there\u2019s plenty of opportunity.Daniel Brutto", "Yeah. I\u2019d just add onto that that certainly we had an extremely large team to work on the TNT transaction. That team now is coming back. A lot of that team was very much involved with our customers, which are value-added sales to customers and certainly now we have that team back in full force. So, that will be a big certainly element in us moving forward to get greater margins in the future.Kurt Kuehn", "And you know, Ken, in the fourth quarter we actually talked about, we had larger customers in the mix, we had lighter products, we had slower moving products that impacted it. But I think as you look forward, we are optimistic on global trade getting back to little more normal in the future. And there are things on. We talked about Europe. We talked about the U.S. making some progress in the fiscal cliff, long ways to go but that could help U.S. consumption. Energy, prices have somewhat stabilized compared with the ups and downs we saw in the last few years. Japan\u2019s easing, it\u2019s going to help the trade out of Japan. And I think the recent change in Chinese leadership is going to help stabilize things and cause quicker growth in China.So things are starting to get us back where we feel that global trade will outperform the global economy, whether 125% to 150% over the growth of GDP, we don\u2019t know. But it will get back to normal relationship.Scott DavisYeah, I think one other thing maybe to add. Alan Gershenhorn talked a little bit about the product innovation too, because as we have said, we are not standing still and we do have a lot of initiatives that are adding more value in the marketplace.Alan GershenhornYeah, so as Kurt said we have done a number of enhancements in new product introductions. We just announced the introduction of UPS Express Freight that Scott talked about in his opening comments. It\u2019s in 37 origins to 41 destinations and it covers about 85% of world trade. And we are certainly excited about that. That product again provides a seamless transition between our express package services into express freight. We have also just enhanced our worldwide expedited service. We have added 145 destinations. And that\u2019s really targeted at higher weight, higher yielding packages. We have also introduced U.S. to Mexico and Mexico standard ground service. And, I guess last but not least, we have enhanced our Paperless Invoice service which really does streamline the international process and creates a significant differentiation for our customers.Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.Bill Greene - Morgan StanleyYeah, Kurt, I think you can hear from some of the questions there is a sense that the guidance is conservative in light of the commentary. And one piece of it that I am just curious about then is, do you make any assumption that there may be a shift of business as we approach the deadline for the Teamsters contract, or is that not expected at all? May be you can get it done even early.Kurt KuehnNo, I think, we feel very confident, as Scott said that we are making good progress and we are still almost half a year out, we have left to go on that, and we do expect that to get concluded successfully and early. The biggest issue really as you talk about the domestic is the headwind we have or the pension frankly was unexpected to some extent and does create about 5% headwind on the domestic results.Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead.Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan", "So just wanted to clarify, the $0.05 of Sandy impact, if you could break that out among the three segments. And then just kind of the longer-term question. The guidance for domestic package margins is pretty flattish year-over-year. Is that just a sense that the pension impact is going to be mostly felt there or do you think we are getting closer to peak on those domestic package margins? Any maybe within the margin commentary, if you can give some thoughts on -- if you have assumed any material changes in the economics with the Teamsters and anything with the priority mail contract with the post office.Scott DavisOkay, a lot of pieces to that one. I will try to unfold them. I will talk a little bit about some of the margin issue and the guidance and then Myron clearly can talk about Sandy and also some of the things that we are doing going forward. Basically, the issue for 2013, we are looking at a sub-trend U.S. GDP of about 2%. We have made good progress and we expect that. We do not think we are at peak margins but we do have $200 million, the vast majority of which is U.S. domestic. So it does hit primarily the domestic segment. So we do think we are continuing to make good progress but with that blip and with a muted U.S. economy, the guidance is appropriate that we do expect modest margin improvement and profits up in the mid-single digits. I\u2019ll turn it over to Myron to talk about Sandy, how that impacted the segments and then a little bit about some of the operating initiatives we have.Myron Gray", "Good morning. Myron Gray. As you heard, Sandy did impact us probably by about $75 million in the fourth quarter, but despite that, as you\u2019ve heard, we did have a good fourth quarter. Now looking forward, as Kurt and Scott have both alluded to, we do face a headwind of about $200 million of pension expected headwind. Without that, we\u2019d be looking at a 10% growth in profit. However, despite the headwinds that we face, we have continued to attract profitable volume, both in B2B as well as B2C and with the deployment of world class technologies, we expect that we\u2019ll get closer to the 14% margin. Actually if you look at full year \u201912, margin was 13.8%. So we\u2019re right at the expected number and really don\u2019t expect not to make it.Scott Davis", "And then one last piece of the puzzle, you made a quick reference to the postal contract. I\u2019ll let David Abney update you a little bit on that.David Abney", "We have responded to the USPS RFP to provide airlift services. We expect to hear back sometime next month. We\u2019re confident we can support the postal services commitment to its mail customers, creating significant growth opportunities for UPS. We look forward to expanding our relationship with them.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.Arthur W. Hatfield \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.Morning everybody. Most of my questions have been answered, but just one quick question on Europe. Post TNT, do you see or anticipate or have you heard from any of your customers that the competitive landscape may change given what\u2019s got on \u2013 what this potential acquisition now going away?Scott DavisDan just came back from Europe last night. So I\u2019ll let Dan give you an answer to that.Daniel Brutto", "Yeah. I guess I spent last week in Davos and had the opportunity to talk to many European multinational customers. They asked me about what our future plans are in Europe. Certainly there\u2019s opportunity for us to expand in certain areas of Europe and Eastern Europe. We do have the best product portfolio right now in Europe with our transporter product and certainly our breadth of portfolio which goes all the way from ocean to certainly express air. I think for the most part we can provide the service. I think certainly TNT would have helped us get there faster, but there are still all kinds of opportunities for us and right now our ability just in the healthcare field to expand our healthcare operations across Europe. We spent a lot of time with healthcare customers who are very excited about getting out of the supply chain brick and mortar business and turning that over to UPS to handle the end to end supply needs that they have. So we\u2019re very excited about the future in Europe.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup Global. Please go ahead.Christian Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup Inc.Good morning guys. Maybe a question just on shipper behavior, particularly in the Asia outbound market. You mentioned some trade-down it sounds like. Is that more just a customer mix issue doing more for the larger players as opposed to more middle markets? Orr are you seeing more strategic changes on how your customers on the whole are treating or managing the supply chain, particularly in that region?Scott DavisWe\u2019ll turn it over to Dan to talk a little bit about that.Daniel BruttoYeah, I guess what's happening is we saw in the last quarter, certainly as margins from some of our large customers gets squeezed in the high-tech area and I would argue in another areas, they look to more efficiency as far as using less premium products, even to the point of going all the way down to ocean. As Kurt mentioned before, we were very successful in ocean in the fourth quarter and actually for 2012, we had our most profitable year in ocean. So I don't suspect that that's going to happen forever, because innovation certainly in the world allows new products to come to market. Those new products have a higher margin and those are the products that fly in our planes and utilize the premium service.Kurt KuehnI'm going to ask Alan maybe talk just a little bit. At the same time we're meeting the needs of very large customers. We have a number of initiatives enabling middle market customers to export. Alan?Alan GershenhornSo we\u2019re \u2013 I think you heard earlier that we're focusing our attention on industry-specific customer solutions. We've talked a lot about healthcare on the call in terms of investing in healthcare complying facilities and technology to enable these middle market customers. Also certainly on the retail side, really working on deploying end-to-end logistics solutions for them. Just switching gears a bit, I was just in Europe also and with our Kiala acquisition, we had a conference. We are watching UK UPS access points and had close to 100 retailers there excited about that opportunity. And that solution there turns those B2C packages into B2B shipments and provides a lot more convenience and accessibility to consumers enabling these retailers to grow their business.Scott DavisWhat fixes it faster than anything is increased demand out of Europe and the United States. And surely in the last couple of years we have had weak demand in both -- most of the developed world. So as that strengthens and we are projecting that, we will strengthen that. That will help this problem.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital MarketsYou guys have talked about the trade down with customers from doing economy service from a priority overnight service. What do you think reverses this trend? Is it simply an uptick in the economy or maybe that\u2019s the new normal?Kurt KuehnWell, I think it\u2019s a combination of events. So I will let Alan talk maybe a little about what we see. You know all this talk about trade-down, we clearly are seeing some of that in the international arena in Europe probably most notably. At the same time we had an extra here, volume growth of 8%. So we are certainly not suffering too badly with our premium product up that strongly. One of the reasons we are seeing that is what we like to call this new Omni channel strategy that many retailers are adopting. So, Alan, maybe you could open that up a little bit?Alan Gershenhorn", "Yeah. And I think, Kurt, to your point, we have been gaining share in the air business for quite some time and a lot of that has to do with our success in the retail sector. Again whether it\u2019s the B2C or B to the stores. And this Omni channel phenomena is really transformation of what's happening in the retail industry and our customers are out there looking for ways to manage between the online channel and the brick and mortar. And so you are seeing folks ordering online through the store, you are seeing folks fulfill online orders from the store, maximizing their inventories and enabling later pickups and so on and so forth.And I think the key to this is having a broad portfolio of services out there and while we have certainly the phenomenon of folks looking for less expensible alternative, there is also still plenty of market out there for consumers that have an urgent need for product and so and so forth, that\u2019s been driving really our air business to the degree that Kurt mentioned.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & CompanyI wanted to talk a little bit kind of this whole mantra of the trade down etcetera, but a little bit more specifically on the new Express Freight product. You know that kind seamlessly integrates this, I assume that\u2019s driven by some of those hi-tech customers that are now packaging what used to be small parcel as more of freight shipments. And I was wondering how that\u2019s kind of effecting, one, kind of your load balances. And, two, just kind of looking forward, whether that freight is more like the UPS traditional small parcel customers moving to that or whether you are gaining additional shares from what would have been more traditional freight customers. Thanks.Scott Davis", "Yeah, good question. I guess certainly we see a lot of opportunity for new and additional volume for this. But, Dan, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit?Daniel BruttoYeah, Nate, on this whole Express Freight product, first of all it\u2019s not limited as we have seen to date to the hi-tech field. It\u2019s in aerospace, it\u2019s in high-end retail. It\u2019s in diversified manufacturing, automotive as well as hi-tech. So it cuts across all. From a customer standpoint, many of the customers use UPS today but the confusion was how do I get this once a month or once every other month express freight shipment that hast to be there. And the unique part about this is they can use the same UPS technology, the same labeling, the same tracking, the same tracing, the same building, which allows them seamlessly to use express freight from us where many times they had to call a forwarder or someone different to do this. So we think it\u2019s very exciting the product is off to a great launch. We think it cuts across multiple industries and it\u2019s going to be a big winner for UPS this year and into the future.Kurt KuehnAnd this is a premium product initiative. This will have yields much higher than our forwarding and are highly compensatory in the express arena. We just have not focused on that segment as much as perhaps we could have in the past.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee. Please ago ahead.Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne AgeeThanks guys. Just one question. I'm going to focus a little bit on Europe and I know a couple of speakers have already asked that. In the wake of no longer being involved in TNT, but going through the diligence, were there practices or things you noticed about the way they were doing business in Europe or is something that would have happened as a result of that acquisition that makes you rethink the way you want to move going forward? I know you talked a little bit about Kiala. Does that change the importance of Kiala? Does that make you rethink say a road freight network or something like that?Kurt KuehnJeff, I think, probably the biggest impact of our TNT deal was that we put a lot of initiatives on hold. We've been very excited about Europe. We've got a great multi-decade story of growth in Europe, frankly, with the largest acquisition in Company history and one that would have taken us over 1,000 people to integrate at max. We were focused on that, and so we did slow down some of the initiatives. But we remain focused on growth there. Alan already mentioned the fact that we\u2019re kicking off our Kiala offering in the U.K. Dan has mentioned that he's putting the scores of people that we'd have working on the integration planning back to work. So, it's really just kicking back into gear with some of growth strategies.Scott DavisJeff, I'd just add that we understand Europe very well. We've been there since the mid-70s. We think we have, as Dan said, the best network over there already. We did learn that the regulatory process is a complicated process over there. So we learned a lot about the commission, but we think we know the market well over in Europe.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.Brandon Oglenski \u2013 BarclaysGood morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. When we look at domestic profitability in the fourth quarter, excluding the Sandy impact, it actually looked like close to a record margin and you've been closer to flat throughout the year. So can you talk about some of the initiatives that you've had to better leverage the B2C traffic in your network along with the flat outcomes in B2B?Kurt KuehnCertainly as we\u2019ve said, operations enhanced with technology is a big priority, and I'll let Myron talk a little bit about some of things that worked well to meet the B2C growth this year and then maybe David talk about some of our research and development for the future.Myron GrayFor years we've talked about enhancing our operating leverage through packaged flow technology, and with that employment over the last few years has helped us totally control the number of base hours that we absorb from our employee base. New technologies like ORION and Telematics helped us reduce the miles driven, hold them flat to 1% while we saw volume growth of 3%. Now, while we have experienced a flurry of B2C growth, I think balance is the more appropriate way to look at it. When you balance B2C with B2B and a carrier like UPS that has an integrated network, it totally allows us to control our costs. So with base rate improvements of 1.7% in the quarter, it helped us balance yield with ops expense of 1.4%. So it really was a good quarter for us from a balanced approach.Kurt KuehnYeah and we are certainly doing a lot of research and development to continue this momentum. David, maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the things that's happening.David AbneyWell, one of the technologies that we are very excited about is SurePost redirect, and what this gives us a capability to do is to route SurePost packages to the lowest cost network. For example, it could be that the final last mile delivery would be through USPS or if we have other packages that are going to be delivered through the UPS network, we can make the call or make that decision on a day-to-day basis and switch those packages over to the UPS network for the last mile of delivery. So it's these operational technologies that are not only reducing our cost, streamlining our network, but they also provide a platform for new customer solutions such as UPS My Choice that we have talked about.Scott DavisAnd I guess one lower tack issue that clearly continue to be a driver of positive momentum in the domestic is this growth in our next air products, that the integrated network allows us to deliver those next air products, particularly the saver products at a very reasonable rate and that\u2019s part of why we are attracting that market so effectively.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ms. Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose & CompanyI just have a fleet related question. I thought you said that you are taking delivery of eight of the 767s this year, which is what you have on order. And then you've got something like a quarter of the fleet in three and four engine aircraft. And with fuel prices really not showing signs of going down, are you thinking about replacement aircraft? Are you thinking about next to add some more efficient aircraft for those 747s and MD-11?Scott DavisDavid, I'll let you talk about that. Yeah.David AbneyWell, like you said, we did talk about the 767s that we are bringing into the network. One thing we have to remember that we have the most modern, most quiet, fuel efficient fleet in the industry. We are the only global integrator that is Stage IV compliant and the age of our aircraft is just much younger than any of our competitors. So, we feel real good about our aircraft and we've made changes for the last 10 to 15 years in updating our aircraft and now we are getting the benefit of such.Scott DavisYeah, Helane, the fleet is almost a decade younger than our primary competitors. It also means, we don't have virtually anything in the way of replacement CapEx for aircraft for the next few years. And part of the great cash flow forecast we'll see is especially after this year that our needs for new aircraft will moderate for a while and certainly will be a great story for cash flow.Kurt KuehnLow CapEx, no pension contributions for a couple years does equate to good cash flow.OperatorOur next question in queue will come from the line of Mr. Peter Nesvold of Jeffries & Company. Please go ahead.Peter Nesvold - Jeffries & CompanyI think most of my questions have been answered. I guess just from a numbers standpoint, one thing that's still not perfectly clear to me. If you are guiding to 9% earnings growth at the midpoint for the year, but you're looking at flat year-over-year for 1Q, that would assume 12% on average through 2Q and 4Q and that's despite the 5% pension headwind. So what drives the step-up? Are there kind of two or three major factors that you can just outline briefly and why you see the earnings acceleration as we progress through the year?Kurt KuehnYeah, I think the outlier is more Q1. There is one less working day. That working day moves to Q3. Typically, that's $50 million or more that you would shift. And, also the early Easter hurts Q1 a bit. So, those are the seasonal issues that really drag down the Q1 scenario. Other than that, the year should be pretty balanced with the third quarter perhaps showing the biggest percent increase year-over-year primarily because of the working day. But other than that, no, we're expecting solid stable results. Perhaps the economy will pick up a little bit later in the year but we're not banking on a robust recovery. Clearly, you've heard that in our guidance.OperatorDue to time constraints our last question for the day will come from the line of Mr. Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs.Tom Kim - Goldman SachsCan I ask you how backhaul volumes are trending both on the Trans-Pacific Europe back to Asia?Scott Davis", "Great. Yeah, I'll give it over to Dan to give us some updates on trends we're seeing right now.Daniel BruttoYeah, I guess on the way back to Asia, primarily from -- I'll start with the U.S. Certainly, the U.S. export we all heard is relatively flat, but it was down at least for the first, second and third quarters and it got to flat in the fourth quarter. So, we don't see a tremendous uplift in U.S. exports and that's part of what Scott has guided to. As far as the European market, again, not a lot of robust growth. I will tell you though, on the positive side, the Asia consumer is very interested in buying goods from both the U.S. and from Europe. So, as Kurt said, we're hoping that in the second half of the year, we're going to see a little bit more of an uplift and some better balance with Asian consumers buying more European and U.S. products.Kurt KuehnYeah, and I think if you look longer term, that's clearly something that most economists are forecasting; that as consumption increases in Asia that the balance flows will begin to improve. Clearly, the lower cost of energy and other issues is bringing some manufacturing back to the U.S. So, that would be a long-term very positive for the air business to make sure that you get comparable loads both directions would be very highlight accretive.Tom Kim - Goldman SachsGreat. If I could just add a follow-up to that. Presumably then this should be margin enhancing, just given your air load factors, trends whether they have been, let's say, Q2, Q3, with that?Kurt Kuehn", "Absolutely. Putting volume on an empty plane is just wonderful for margins.Tom Kim - Goldman SachsRight. If I could just ask one last question. Just with regard to DHL, they came out mid last year suggesting some pretty aggressive expansion plans in Asia. Have you seen anything to that effect that suggests some changes in the pricing dynamics in that market?Scott DavisPricing remains very competitive although we haven't seen any dramatic change in the basic relationship. It's rational but competitive and certainly cycles somewhat with capacity and demand imbalances.

My name is Stephen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.", "After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we will take only one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", " ", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning and welcome to UPS's third quarter earnings call. Joining today are Scott Davis, our CEO and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney; International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we will make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2012 Form 10-K and 2013 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons to 2012, will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS's free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call along with the reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Finally, our goal is to allow as many as possible to participate on today's call, so please ask one question and then get back in the queue. Thanks for your cooperation.", "Now, let me turn it over to Scott.", "Scott Davis", "Thanks and good morning. Our third quarter results improved from the first half of the year even though our business faced similar market dynamics. Customers continue to streamline the supply chains allowing UPS to meet their needs with our integrated solutions and logistics expertise.", "The U.S. domestic business continues to benefit from the e-commerce, while international experienced strong demand for UPS deferred products. Performance in our Supply Chain & Freight segment improved, primarily from ocean forwarding, brokerage and North American Airfreight results.", "Regarding the global economic environment, forecast for growth in EU have been revised upward as it begins to recover from recession. However, Asian economic projections are mixed as expansion in Japan has been offset somewhat by slowing China growth.", "Here in the U.S., uncertainty created by the partial shutdown of U.S. government has created some anxiety, while the impact to UPS on surface appears to be minimal, some experts predict the shutdown will be a drag on fourth quarter GDP. Though the shutdown is behind us, temporary solutions like sequestration and government furloughs only delayed the inevitable.", "Hitting the snooze button on our fiscal problems only extends uncertainty and dampens economic growth. No business could survive without careful management's resources and our country can't either. Now is the time for the government to fix the debt and put America's house in order.", "Although our political leaders struggled to effectively implement economic policy, companies worldwide are successfully adapting to evolving market conditions and evaluating all options to improve their bottom lines and UPS can help with our comprehensive portfolio of capabilities. We are built to meet the needs of business whether it's via ground, air or ocean, an integral part of developing these solutions, is listening to our customers. For example, our Latin American executives told us they expected strong growth in the region, we took action.", "During the quarter, UPS launched the industry's first Guaranteed Standard Service from the U.S. to Mexico. By leveraging our extensive network and brokerage expertise, UPS now provides a seamless delivery experience for southbound shipments.", "The company also expanded our preferred LCL Ocean product to serve the Asia to Mexico lane. In addition, UPS has opened new express service centers to serve the fast-growing region of Northern Mexico. Continuing our commitment to invest across the portfolio and around the world, we opened distribution to Hangzhou and Shanghai, China further expanding our capabilities.", "Now, I want to take a moment to update on our labor negotiations. As we announced back in the summer, our employees approved the National Master, which covers the key elements to contract, wages, pension and healthcare. Work continues on the open supplements. In the last month progress has been made with majority receiving approval. This includes a largest area, the central region and other large areas like New York. The remaining supplements will go out soon and we are confident in their approval. UPS will continue to work to expedite ratification to our employees to start receiving improved wages and benefits in the new contract. Until then, the current agreements remain in place.", "Now, let me turn it over to Kurt to provide more insight into UPS third quarter results.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, thanks and good morning everyone. As Scott noted, while supply chains are becoming and more efficient, they are increasing in their complexity. UPS's third quarter results reflect the company's ability to adapt to the shifting demands of our customers around the world. Earnings per share improved 9.4% on revenue growth of 3.4. These are solid results considering market trends and the global economic environment.", "Now, let's review the segment results. U.S. Domestic had a good quarter. Operating profit climbed 16% and margin expanded 140 basis points to 14.4%. Volume growth improved efficiency including savings from UPS safety initiatives and one additional operating day contributed to the success. In addition, while the fuel surcharge lag was a slight drag for the quarter, on a year-over-year basis it was a benefit.", "Revenue was up 5% on a daily package volume increase of 2.3 as e-commerce continues to thrive. B2C shipments were up 5% during the quarter and we saw an increase in B2B volumes also mainly from retail shippers. Looking at the product level, daily ground volume was up 3% and deferred air improved 2.3%.", "Next Day Air volume declined 3.3%, reflecting losses of letter volume. Further contributing to slower air growth, some shippers have moved their distribution facilities closer to the customers enabling the greater use of UPS ground to obtain shorter time in transit.", "Revenue per piece increased 1%, reflecting base rate increases that were offset by lower fuel surcharges, lighter average weight and changes in product and customer mix. UPS Next Day Air yield was 3% higher while ground was up 1.9%, deferred yield declined 2%, primarily due to significantly lower average weight. We were able to create operating leverage and lowered our cost per piece by effectively managing the UPS network. Our typical cost metrics of miles driven, direct labor hours and block hours, all contributed to productivity", "Now for some details on the international results, total segment revenue increased 2.5% on strong volume growth of 6.5%. Operating profit declined 7% to $417 million. Operating margin and profit were lower as savings for network adjustments and cost initiatives were offset by $75 million in headwinds from currency and fuel. Without these two items, operating profit would have been up approximately 10%. In addition, the segment continued to be impacted by shifting customer preference for deferred products.", "Currency-neutral yields dropped 4.3%, driven primarily by a 5% decline in export product yields. Shippers continued to use non-premium UPS products like Worldwide Expedited and trans-border standard both, of which increased 11%. In addition, our premium products were up 1%.", "Growth in shorter trade lanes and lower fuel surcharges also contributed to yield declines. UPS daily export volume increased by 6.7% in the quarter, driven by faster growth from Europe, Canada and Mexico.", "Intra-Europe volume was up more than 10%, while Asian exports were flat with last year. Non-U.S. Domestic products climbed 6.3% per day led by strong gains across Europe and Canada. The developing economies of Turkey and Poland were both up approximately 20%, so we saw a good growth in the quarter but overall our results were a little bit less than we expected. Rest assured, UPS is building on our in-country cost initiatives and will make the necessary network adjustments to ensure that we continue to generate the industry's highest margins.", "Now, regarding Supply Chain & Freight. The segment demonstrated improvement this quarter, with operating profit up almost 7% on flat revenue growth. Top line gains at UPS freight were offset by declines in forwarding. Operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 8.9%, matching our previous high for the segment.", "The weak demand in the Asia forwarding market continues to put pressure on rates. International forwarding revenue declined due to lower tonnage and revenue per kilo, both down about 3% to 4%, but solid performance from our ocean, our brokerage and our North American air freight sectors enabled the business unit to expand operating profit and margin in the quarter. In addition, our international air freight made good progress in adapting to these market conditions.", "In distribution, operating profit improved and generated the margin of approximately 9%. The revenue growth was relatively flat to last year. Revenue gains in the Healthcare and Mail Services were offset by some declines in the High Tech sector and remember during 2012, the unit did benefit from UPS's participation in the London Olympic Games.", "Turning now to UPS Freight, LTL revenue increased 5.5%, driven by shipment growth of about 4% and improvements in revenue per 100 weight. Operating margin for the business contracted slightly as wage and benefit increases were not fully offset by productivity improvements?", "Now, let's review our financial strength. For the nine months ended September 30th UPS generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow after capital expenditures of $1.6 billion. So far this year, UPS has paid $1.7 billion in dividends, an increase of almost of 9% per share.", "In addition, we have repurchased $33 million shares for approximately $2.9 billion, well on our way to our guidance of $4 billion for the year. Our cash position and balance sheet remain strong. The first priority always is to use it to grow the business then to reward our share owners and finally to seek opportunities to mitigate risk and volatility to our balance sheet. I do want to highlight that our Q3 tax rate increased to 36%. This was partially due to an increased mix of profits from the U.S. compared to the rest of the world. We do expect the rate of 36% for the fourth quarter also.", "Now, for a bit more color on fourth quarter guidance for the business segments. In U.S. Domestic, we expect daily volume to grow by 3% to 4%, revenue was expected to up about the same as volume. Base rate improvements will be masked somewhat by lower fuel surcharges as well as changes in mix and package characteristics.", "We expect operating profits to grow in line with revenue. Reflecting back to 2012, remember that our domestic margin benefited from nearly 8% growth in Next Day Air, something we don't expect to see this year.", "Looking forward, the wildcard will be the opportunities and challenges of a compressed peak season. For the International segment, we expect volume growth of 3% to 5% although product mix and currency will continue to weigh on yields. We expect high single-digit profit growth with operating margin around 16%.", "These expectations include a negative currency impact of approximately $30 million to $40 million. At Supply Chain & Freight, we expect revenue growth to be down somewhat as freight forwarding continues to experience lower demand in yield. Despite the challenging conditions in the international air freight market and continued investments in healthcare, we expect operating margin to expand to about 8%.", "Overall, we remain confident in our full year earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.65 to $4.85 per share. We are looking forward to the fourth quarter and of course the holiday season. ", "Now, Alan Gershenhorn will share with you some thoughts about the upcoming peak. Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Thanks, Kurt, and good morning. The holiday peak season is always an exciting time at UPS, and this year will be no different. Consumers around the world count on us to deliver their holiday gifts on time and in perfect condition. For 2013, the National Retail Federation expects holiday retail sales to increase 3.9%. More importantly, for UPS, online sales are expected to rise between 13% and 15%.", "At UPS, some of our retailers are cautious in their holiday outlook, however they go into the season with more flexible supply chain options than ever before. Retail customers are focused on managing inventory levels and providing the right customer experience to drive growth. This includes working with UPS on omni-channel strategies, which help to create better touch points for consumers, improve utilization of brick-and-mortar square footage and to ship inventory directly from stores, all enhancing the overall customer experience.", "Retail customers also talk to us about having a flexible supply chain, so they can respond quickly to market changes. At UPS, we expect this year's holiday season will be another for the record books as we picked up more than 34 million packages on our peak day.", "As Kurt mentioned in the fourth quarter, we expect package volume to grow 3% to 4%, however with the later Thanksgiving this year, there are six fewer shopping days from Black Friday to Christmas. As a result, we expect daily volume over this shortened window to be up 8%.", "UPS is continuing to make the holidays easier for consumers too. Our industry first solution UPS My Choice has now exceeded 5 million subscribers. Recent enhancements will provide subscribers the ability to organize their hectic holiday schedule by managing their online orders with the UPS delivery calendar. In addition, UPS My Choice consumers can choose to receive their UPS SurePost shipments earlier by upgrading to UPS ground. By the way UPS, MyChoice services are now available on Facebook, the online home to more consumers.", "Peak season does not end for us at Christmas. The rapid growth of e-commerce has created a third peak for UPS that starts after the holidays and keeps us tussling into the middle of January. During this period, consumers are taking advantage of gift cards and retailer year end close outs as well as returning gifts received during the holiday.", "The UPS returns portfolio offer several solutions that help shippers control returned goods and provide their customers with a hassle free returns experience. As you can see, there's a lot going on at UPS to prepare for the high demands for service.", "I want to wish you and your family a wonderful holiday season, and of course order early, often, and most importantly, have it shipped through UPS.", "Now, I'll turn it back over to Kurt.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, great. Thanks, Alan, and we are ready now to open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Nate Brochmann - William Blair", "Hi. Why don't you talk a little bit, I mean obviously if you go back to last quarter, we had a lot of disruption in terms of like shifting around some assets to account for where the freight was coming from and lot of the customer preferences on the deferred.", "Clearly, you guys have done a pretty quick job of that and obviously that's benefited the integrated network. As we go into the holiday season and you talk about the flexible solutions that Alan just mentioned, how do you continue to reallocate assets based on where are the freight's flowing to maintain the most flexibility for your customers while maintaining the most profitability for you guys?", "Scott Davis", "Well, that's certainly something that UPS has been working on for many years and we think as a benefit of us being able to have one integrated network or we can shift capacity. You know, having a ready fleet of aircraft we can adjust to and certainly having ability to move those quickly is important.", "One area though that clearly we do this time of the year especially is, we spend a lot of time talking to our major shippers about the holidays and that helps get us a little bit of shake for the peak season anyway. Alan, maybe you could talk a little bit about our approach of preparing expectations for peak.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. As I said in my opening comments, some of our retailers are a bit cautious, but they are ready more than ever with the execution of these omni-channel strategies that we are helping them with, and really what that does is it helps these retailers better optimize, minimize and better utilize both, their in-store and their DC inventories, so they are prepared for any online growth acceleration.", "It obviously also helps them maximize the price they get for their goods by avoiding markdowns and it also creates that seamless in-store and online experience for the shoppers, so we are pretty excited about the solutions that we have in place for our retailers this year to adjust for any eventualities.", "Scott Davis", "I guess the other component in your question there is, the international component. Jim, maybe you can talk a little bit about the flexibility that we try to build and react to customer demand this time of the year.", "Jim Barber", "No problem. Obviously, the base network, I think you would note as you said in the opening open, we have done a pretty good job over the years to balance that and utilize that. I think the other capabilities that we have in our forwarding unit go down the charters, the ability for a large customers to flex when they needed, so we can bring chatterers into the network or not.", "The other advantage that we have with network, the ability to flex it with extra rotations at peak capacity, so at that time we feel like we have got the baseline and the foundation, we have a very optimized network at the same time.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. Thanks. Great job on the domestic side, so let me kind of focus a bit on the international. Kurt, if I heard you right, I think you said margins might rise to about 16%, and they were down year-on-year if I heard that right in this quarter. Just wanted to know what you're doing there in order to get that margin up and is there a cost cutting program and you are taking more assets out just given that international look like a little disappointing in contrast to the strength you saw on the domestic side?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Ken. Thanks for the question. We are feeling very good about the activities in international. I'll let Jim talk a little bit about it, but you saw the very strong growth that we had in the quarter. We think that momentum is going to continue. Also the headwinds of the fuel and the currency did offset a lot of the hard work, so Jim, maybe you could talk a little bit about why you have increasing confidence in our international sector.", "Jim Barber", "Sure. Obviously, this quarter down $32 million, we had [$75 million] headwinds going against that. We talked about the headwinds coming, but at the same time, beneath that when you look across the geographies, you can see increasing momentum quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter. Right now, we have got very, very good growth and capabilities in Europe and our Americas business and you have heard some of the comments in the opening lines of the trans-border network, so as Asia continues to struggle a bit, in the middle of that, we adjust, we go forward and you have heard a couple other comments about some of our new integrated networks in Turkey and Poland that have great 20% growth year-over-year, so we are confident for best and we are confident when some of these headwinds get behind us, you will see that as well.", "Scott Davis", "Kurt mentioned that fundamentals, we really grew profits 10%, take care of the currency and the fuel, so we felt good about the fundamentals of the business. As you look to 2014, again, we think that currency will not be the issue we saw on 2013, so that will eliminate one of those headwinds as we move into next year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Good morning. I wanted to ask you little bit more about international, I guess it will probably be a popular topic today, but can you give us a sense on what pricing conditions are? Then, I guess, in terms of if there is some weakness in pricing you got to trade down, how much of a headwind is that to margin when you look at 2014, or is it something that given the ability to adapt the network that it's really not a big issue for you when look at kind of profitability in international in 2014? Thanks.", "Jim Barber", "Tom, the issue in international even though I know the currency adjusted yields for exports look very weak with the negative 5%, the vast majority of that impact is not pricing pressure. It is the trade lane mix and the user deferred products.", "As we said, our deferred products grew by 11%, and a very strong growth, the continent of Europe showed a 10% growth in shipments, so packages moving around Europe have substantially lower revenues, but also a lot less cost so we feel very comfortable that the market is competitive but stable on the price side.", "As we adjust and adapt and it is great to see Europe picking up steam, I think part of that is the economy getting a little firmer, but most of it is company-specific. As we had talked about early this year, we felt that as we focus back on organic growth strategy, you would see the results of that, so we are pretty comfortable with the pricing environments rational.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Hey, Kurt. Kurt, I am wondering if you can provide us with a little bit more color on the fourth quarter. You gave a lot of details around each one of the operating segments and that was helpful, but I think there might be some puts and takes, so that I am not fully grasping in. When I look at sort of a normal sequential change in the earnings, typically I think it's up in the fourth quarter about 14%, 15%, but the midpoint of the range here would be closer to 29%, 30%. Is it all currency that's kind of driving that? It feels like that's not enough, so I am not sure what else I'm missing that would kind of get us more to the mid-point or is it just the economic assumptions that really justify the top and low end of the ranges there?", "Jim Barber", "You are talking for the business in aggregate, rather than just international?", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. More like an EPS comment. Just because when you take the mid-point, it seems like it's a pretty big step-up and I am not sure I have all the pieces.", "Jim Barber", "I don't think it's a huge gap against the historical trends anyway. You know, we are seeing good positive momentum in International. I gave you the guidance on that. International, we are looking for profit growth, although frankly there are both, great opportunities and also some risks of a compressed peak season that and Myron will certainly talk about in little while. As you compress the holidays into less days, if things go smoothly and the weather is positive, then there is good opportunity.", "On the other hand, it does create some challenges, so we comfortable that we can deliver in the range that we have given and I think that the parts of the [Parcel] that we gave will help to back that up.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon - Bernstein Research", "Hi. Good morning, guys. A quick question on the domestic competitive dynamic. Last couple of quarters Next Day Air volume, you noted that the letter traffic is down, you are seeing some things about sort of One Rate pricing stuff like that coming out. How do you feel about the domestic sort of priority market and the competitive dynamic there?", "Scott Davis", "Yes. Certainly, the market continuing to stable, we did show some improvements, but I will let Alan talk a little bit about some of the other issues.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. Certainly, we had strong growth in our ground and our deferred products. Speaking specifically to the Next Day Air, certainly our letter volume was down and that's tied to professional services with a slowdown in the financial services sector as a result of the interest rates climbing a bit and we did see a few losses from some of our large banks.", "David Vernon - Bernstein Research", "Then there is a corresponding uptick in the Next Day Air yield. Is that a sort of positive mix shift or better pricing in there?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "That will be more packages versus letters would help drive that.", "David Vernon - Bernstein Research", "Okay great.", "Scott Davis", "I guess one other point just to remember on the air is, we did have a very strong air quarter last year. I think our next day shipments were up 7%, so part of that is the much tougher comp.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. ", "Please go ahead.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "Why don't I dig in a little bit on the domestic side? I mean, it looks like you guys got some good pickup on efficiency gains and I know you've got some pretty initiatives with ORION and the SurePost redirect pieces of the business going on, so maybe you could talk a little bit about where you are ORION implementation and how many miles have gotten out of your network.", "Then on the SurePost redirect, how much of that e-commerce traffic that you are moving is being leveraged by the UPS network now instead of handing off to USPS?", "Scott Davis", "Great. Glad to. I'll turn that over to Myron to fill you in little bit, but we were pleased clearly with the domestic for the quarter and I did mention though we had an extra working day which also helps and we had some safety benefits, but, yes, Myron's people have been very busy rolling out some of these new applications, so Myron?", "Myron Gray", "Good morning, Justin. We continue to take advantage of a healthy pipeline of technology deployments throughout the year. To answer your question specifically, we have been able to redirect approximately 20% of our SurePost volume back into the U.S. Domestic delivery network by improving our delivery densities. As a result of that, we have been able to control the number of direct miles driven.", "Simultaneously, we have also taken advantage of leveraging our Worldport operations by reducing domestic block hours by over 3.7%. If you will also recall, we fully deployed telematics only six months ago, so we expect to get a continued upside from that and we have only deployed about 13% of our U.S. drivers on ORION right now and early results have been extremely positive, so we believe that there is more available for us.", "Scott Davis", "Yes. Do remember though that the ORION is a multi-year rollout. It's very deep integrated expansion that has to be route specific, but thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to stick with U.S. Domestic, it was nice to see a specifically call out B2B volumes during the quarter, so just wondering if you can give us a sense of the magnitude and whether we may have turned a corner from the B2B perspective? ", "Then how we should think about that leveraging into the network? You had strong margins during the quarter. Can B2B help sustain levels like we saw in the third quarter going forward?", "Scott Davis", "Well, I think the B2B did show modest growth, really B2C continues to outperform. I don't want to put too positive a spin on it. I guess, it was really the retail sector, especially with the omni-channel and us moving goods between stores and retailers adjusting their supply chains that drove up the B2B component. The rest of the sectors were fairly flat, maybe slightly negative.", "Jim Barber", "We are still looking for that pickup pick up in manufacturing that's been called for. It's been slow all year long, but hopefully if we can make some decisions on Washington, we will get the manufacturing going again.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie", "Then can you help us to think about whether these margins levels you had very strong in third quarter. How we can think about that going forward maybe?", "Jim Barber", "Well, we have given you some pretty good sense for fourth quarter anyway and both, the opportunities and the challenges. We will be talking a lot more about 2014 next quarter anyway, so we are really not at a point to give any guidance going forward, but rest assured we are working hard to keep our customers satisfied and manage our cost.", "Scott Davis", "If we would be successful on projects like ORION, naturally bodes well for domestic margins and Jim talked about where we are going internationally and then we will tell you a lot more in January.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citi", "Thanks. Good morning guys. You talked a little bit about international capacity just curious kind of how you think about the pace of activity internationally and whether there is really the need to joining more overcapacities for where you stand in the quarter as well would be helpful. Thanks.", "Scott Davis", "Let me start off with David Abney talking about their air network and utilization and how we reacted there.", "David Abney", "", "Well, we have continued to match network capacity to volume trends. For international, for the third quarter, block hours were down 1%, while our export volume was up 6.7%. For the fourth quarter, the truck routes from Asia to the U.S., we will fluctuate between the 7.5% and 8%. We would probably be down about 4% total international block hours from last year, so that's what we are seeing. You have to remember that we have significantly cut Asia to U.S. block hours by 20% over the last two years and we are continuing to monitor and see where we need to make Ad Hoc cuts.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Why don't you just drill down on the domestic package margins a little bit again? Is there any way - Kurt, you just put some numbers around how much you think that the operating day benefits you.", "The safety improvements, is there any number around that and do you view that as ongoing or one-time-ish. Then I am just curious in this interim period without the labor contract, are you still approving for the wage increases?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I guess to what we have I think pretty consistently estimated that an extra working day usually gives you about $50 million, maybe $60 million depending on when it hits anyway, so that's something we anticipate and plan and forecast for.", "Third quarter, every year is a year usually where we make entries for workers' comp and safety. Actually, last year, there was a little more of that in the fourth quarter than the third, so that gave us a little bit of a boost, but not material. Yes. We are accruing for the contract as it stands and as Scott said, we are working through the details on that and are looking forward to getting that wrapped up pretty soon.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Do you have a number on the equivalent for that safety?", "Scott Davis", "No. I don't. It's been a little bit in multiple sectors.", "Jim Barber", "But it is something like as Kurt said, over the last 10 years pretty much every third quarter, we do an actuarial evaluation. We have done a great job on safety and every year we see benefit.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben Hartford - Baird", "Good morning, guys. Jim, could you provide some context to the forwarding dynamics? I know you guys have been managing your capacity tightly in the international trade lanes. I know Asia volumes are still a little softer, which growth is decelerating, but it sounds like capacity has been taken out of that market and pricing dynamics within the forwarding market are still pressured. Do you get the sense that they are still lingering margin gross margin pressure with forwarding given the pricing dynamics in the industry, plus underlying rates firming up or being rational?", "Scott Davis", "Before I turn it over to Jim, in our guidance, we do expect to see modest revenue declines although the unit's done a good job of adjusting. Jim, maybe you could fill us in a little bit more on the view of the market.", " ", "Jim Barber", "Yes. I guess, over the last couple of days and about the last week or so some information has come out that actually contradicts that and that there are some backlogs out in Asia coming out. Quite frankly, the way we look at it right now is that there are some upticks in volume, obviously that would obviously coincide with some rate, but we planned for that.", "We know there is some capacity reductions in the market as well that kind of go in hand-in-hand, but I think over the next couple of weeks we will ultimately see what happens with the demand side, but we think, we at UPS, we are in good shape to handle that obviously with the way we run the network, but the other side of about the forwarding businesses is, it is a pretty volatile market all the time, you have to adjust to it and we feel like in the last couple of years, we invested nicely in some technology to help us do that in the years to come, so we are very comfortable with where the rates are going.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Art Hatfield - Raymond James", "Good morning, everyone. Real quick on the fourth quarter, and you have made some comments regarding the shortened holiday season. It would seem to me that given your flexibility and all the different services you can offer customers, the potential benefits would outweigh the risks, but it sounds like you are focusing on the potential incremental costs or the risk associated with the shortened holiday season. Can you kind of help me understand that a little bit better?", "Scott Davis", "I will take a shot at that. I think, Kurt, used the term wildcard. Frankly, a compressed holiday period, if weather is perfect it's good. Probably it will benefit us as we have been able to move our volumes to our network efficiently in the shorter days, shorter hours. The question is, if we get a nice storm (Inaudible), you know one of those days? It's going to be hard to make up for it. I think it's one of those things that are kind of a risk reward type deal. If whether is great, we will probably get rewarded. If weather is bad, there will be a challenge for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the domestic results this quarter. When I go back to your 2011 Analyst Meeting, and you laid out the growth targets of 10% to 15% for EPS, you guys, I think were assuming a U.S. economy of 2.5% to 3.5% at that time. Have you gotten to the point where you have transitioned the business to reflect the slower environment, where you think you can get back on track for some of these longer term earnings growth targets?", "Jim Barber", "We have made pretty good progress on our domestic business with the margins steadily improving and moving forward, so we feel that clearly we have done a lot of adaptation both, product shifts and economic changes.", "International, clearly with the headwinds and global trade that we saw for the last couple of years has probably been the bigger surprise and that is one where Jim and the network people have been very busy adapting to that, and hopefully you get a sense that we think we are making progress on that, but that's really the bigger probably difference since the investor conference couple of years ago.", "Scott Davis", "Looking at this year, we weren't very far off those goals when we set our guidance at the start of the year taken out the currency and the fuel impact and pension, particular, so hopefully if interest rates stay where they are, pension will not be a headwind next year. We think currency will not be a headwind next year, so we are positioned better to get close to those targets.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. What's the organic growth rate you are seeing out of the European operations on the same-store basis?", "Scott Davis", "That 10% growth in exports is purely organic. Now, some of that's Turkey and Poland came from acquisition several years ago, but I think we feel particularly gratified that we are seeing, as Jim mentioned, this extension that we have done to the periphery markets around Europe is succeeding. Jim?", "Jim Barber", "Really both in Europe, I think we are pretty proud over the last couple of years, we had some acquisitions in Poland, in Turkey and the U.K. all those integrations are done, behind us, and all of those markets quite frankly all growing double-digit, so that in the combination of the trans-border network over there and the express network, it's a really good story for us right now, so everything for the most is good obviously.", "Our next step with TNT, that's behind us now and now kind of turned our focus over our people and all that UPS has to offer the customers to emerging markets in some of the other places that we are now going, so we think the future is bright.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs", "If I could ask what is the sort of key end market that the growth is occurring? Is it more intra-Europe or is that actually Transatlantic? If you could just maybe add little bit more detail around that that would be helpful? Thanks.", "Scott Davis", "Well, right now if you stand inside Europe from that geography, obviously, our intra-European growth is very good. You have got a double-digit growth in the inside, because of the great network we have there. We have got some lanes depending on where you are going our U.S. lane continues to grow nicely across the globe. Again, we are pretty proud of being able to offer domestic customers and geographies from Turkey to the U.K. to Germany, across the world and that piece of the world some great opportunity and they grow at double digits as well, so it's growing in many facets.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison Landry - Credit Suisse", "Just following up on the European business, you have talked a lot about double-digit growth in the intra-European geography, so I was wondering if you could comment on the relative profitability of regional package flows versus more intra-country. Then also your thoughts on whether European margins can ultimately reflect those in the U.S.?", "Scott Davis", "Yes. In general, we do have higher margins in our export business than the domestic business. The benefit of our domestic business is, they give us a decent margin, but they also create the density that allows this UPS integrated network to create the returns that you guys enjoy so much. As far as the targets, certainly the priority is growth in export. Jim's people balance them, what the appropriate amount of domestic business is country-by-country to create infrastructure.", "Beyond that, what we really look at is return on capital, so we make sure that those products that drive the most assets, those flying across oceans and those things, generate the higher margins. Beyond that, we don't really open up the can of worms.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Ross - Stifel", "Good morning, gentlemen. Wanted to talk about UPS Freight. Yields declined a little bit, but partially due to the higher average weight per shipment. Could you comment on of kind what's going on the average length of haul in that division that may have also impacted the yield? Then any update you have on the new union contracts of the UPS Freight team, it would be great?", "Scott Davis", "Yes. First let me correct fact. Yields were up in the quarter, so they weren't up quite as much as in previous quarters, but still we showed a 2.2% increase in revenue per 100 weight, so that's not an issue.", "David Ross - Stifel", "Okay. In the Excel sheet I got to, 21.94 versus 22 a year ago, so had it actually declined 0.3% LTL revenue per 100 weight?", "Scott Davis", "Maybe. I don't know what you are looking at. We will have to take it offline. Go ahead, Myron, maybe on the business progress from what you guys are doing?", "Myron Gray", "Yes. I think, our progress is in line with what we told you guys at our Investor's conference in 2011, with expected margin improvement. While revenue did improve over 5% and revenue per tonne went up over 4% and it was somewhat offset by not being able to get the kind of productivity improvements that we look for out of our freight operations and we will continue to deploy small package-like productivity improvements with the use of technology in freight in the coming months and would expect to perform better.", "Scott Davis", "As far as the contract, I think we are making progress. I think we would spend lot of time between the UPS teams and union leadership really communicating and educating the people about the new contract, there were changes in healthcare that were confusing to people. We have done this process and the package side of the Master have had good results and we communicated the new contract. We expect the same on the freight side. Hopefully, we will get it out for vote here in near-future.", "David Ross - Stifel", "Kurt, sorry, I was looking at the year-to-date yield numbers around in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Dan Hartford - Oppenheimer", "Good morning, guys. This is Dan Hartford filling in for Scott. Touching on the buybacks and the use of capital, can you please clarify the $4 billion is for the target for 2013? And if you can help us understand how you think about the use of capital in 2014 as well? Thank you.", "Scott Davis", "Yes. Well, certainly, as we said we remain on target to deliver the redistribution with the share repurchases. We spent just a little shy of $3 billion year-to-date on that front, so we are moving along as said and we tend to set a target each year and complete what we do, so barring any unusual market conditions or something, we expect to continue the remainder of that.", "The higher priority always is to invest in growth. Certainly, we have got the balance sheet to do it. Although, we have been targeting more smaller acquisitions things like CEMELOG in Eastern Europe to expand our healthcare network and other targeted acquisitions, so we will continue following that path, also continue to support a very strong dividend, so we are looking for opportunities and application, capital, plus we would also used capital in some cases to reduce the risk and volatility to the balance sheet. You have seen that with some of the moves we have done on the pension, so we have got a lot of choices and part of our job is to prudently allocate capital and keep remembering that it's share owner's money and it's our duty to use it prudently or return it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens", "", "Hi. Thanks for the time. Just to dig in again here on the forwarding business, just curious if you could maybe comment on the competitive landscape, competitive dynamics really within the forwarding industry? Have seen any improvement there as we move through the year with regard to just competitive pricing pressures?", "Then secondly, when you think about the slate of tech launches that a lot of folks are expecting to see for this quarter, but what type of volume trends would you expect to see in your forwarding business out of Asia to the U.S. in the 4Q?", "Scott Davis", "Yes. I'll start off at least kind of the trends. Clearly, as Jim mentioned, we are seeing some pickup in demand. That's typical for the beginning of peak season and there are some launches that will give a boost. Jim, any thoughts or comments on the competitive environment?", "", "Jim Barber", "As I said a minute ago, I mean, over the last couple of days some of the competitors have seen what appears to be some pickup in demand that's match against the capacity constrictions, but from our perspective, we feel like we are in good shape.", "As I said last quarter, we feel like we are bit too concentrated in some areas in forwarding that we will move in the next quarter to work through that, but we know that based upon the charter activity, we are being asked to perform right now in the previous couple of weeks and going forward. We know there is demand out there and we need to fulfill that, so we even feel like we are pretty comfortable with that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham", "", "Thank you very much and congratulations. Most of my questions have been asked at this point. Could you give us an update on UPS Access Point? How that's performing in Europe, and if there are thoughts that that product could eventually be rolled out in other global markets?", "Scott Davis", "Yes. We would be happy to talk about that. That is clearly a big initiative for the international access, so Jim do you want to talk a little bit about the rollout and where we are heading on that?", "Jim Barber", "Sure. I think, we have to remember when we bought Kiala, they had about 65,500 access points in France in Benelux and we have rolled that out now and expanded into the U.K. and Germany by the middle of next year we will have 2,000 to 3,000 access points in each of those countries. The rollout is going just as we thought it would. In a second, I will turn it over to Alan with respect to going forward to some widening of what we see, but we also like that the combination of access points and what it can do for our delivery network, we are already expanding it into the usage of drivers in alternate delivery. We also like to power of the access points to create cross-border traffic in the single market of Europe, so we are pretty pleased with where we are. Alan, if you want to add anything?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. I think to that point, Jim, it's a Swiss army knife really, because we are changing residential into high density commercial sops, we are using it for these not-in-one alternate deliveries back to these access points. We are using it for e-commerce returns and prepaid drop-offs, so we are really excited about what it's enabling us to penetrate the B2C market in Europe cost effectively.", "We are over 10,000 in access points now, so we are now in the U.K. and Germany. Those were our expansion plans and we are continuing to grow in France, Benelux and Spain, and we are serving about 450 retailers at this particular point right now in the Europe, so we are really excited about the opportunity it's creating for us in the European environment.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham", "", "Do you think the bigger opportunity is more of a weak customer penetration, because you have more convenient access points or is there is a cost saving side, where you are reducing the amount of redeliveries or just making it easier to give packages to customers?", "Scott Davis", "It's actually both. As you know in the United States, we are very big in retail. Retail has not been our focus really in the past in Europe from a B2C perspective, so this is the big opportunity for UPS to penetrate the retail market throughout Europe with better solutions that are available in the market today. To your point, do it in a way that is profitable, because of the density that we can create and the other point I would just make is that many of the consumers in Europe really prefer getting their deliveries at these access points versus at home and some of our retailers have over 50% of their packages being delivered to these access points versus their residential homes.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham", "", "Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson Davis & Company. Please go ahead.", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis Company", "Yes. Thank you very much and good morning. I heard you say that your international block hours would be down 4% in the fourth quarter, which is apparently more than they were down in the third quarter. Given this pickup in demand in Asia-Pacific region, how is that going to help your company international revenues and forwarding profits in the fourth quarter?", "Scott Davis", "That's good question, David. We certainly have some flexibility that maybe, David, you could talk about that.", "David Abney", "", "Yes. What I said was that it would be down 4% from last year in the fourth quarter. One of the things that we look at very closely is, how the calendar flows and where we can cut flights on an ad hoc basis and we made those decisions.", "We continue to monitor the capacity and we have the ability to map up flights if we need to and add those rotations, but we can also cutback, so we have the flexibility, we have the network in place and we have been doing this for years. In fact, if you look since 2008, our international block hours are down almost 5%, our export volume is up almost 20%, so we have this thing fine tuned and we can make the adjustments we need no matter which way it may swing throughout the quarter.", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis Company", "Thank you.", "Scott Davis", "Yes. One of the real value creations, where we have been working on the last few years is to take advantage of both, our forwarding network and our owned fixed assets and have enough flexibility to move volume and freight especially in and out of them.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker - Cowen", "Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Almost all my questions, but one, have been actually asked and answered. Thank you very much. As we look ahead, Kurt, to 2014, and we think about some the changes in healthcare laws and so on, how should we think about compensation as regard to the healthcare? I know you made some changes earlier this year to your plans, but what healthcare cost increases are going to look like? Thank you", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. Hi, Helane. Unfortunately, you may help us wrap this call on a down note.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Our healthcare expenses continue to be a challenge. We had made some modifications to our plans to help to manage cost, but still the Affordable Care Act is continuing to add a burden to us. The transition tax for covered life is a big deal for us. We think there is over $100 million of expense, so all-in-all that is a headwind that will be in the healthcare for next year on that.", "Helane Becker - Cowen", "Okay. Thank you. You can repeat something positive if you want.", "Scott Davis", "That's okay. It's an important and certainly we are eager to find solutions to it. ", "Helane Becker - Cowen", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo", "Good morning. Thank you. You mentioned continued efforts with omni-channel retailing. I am curious if you could bring us up to speed on where some of the retailer efforts are with ship-to-store activity was sort of a hot topic earlier this year. Is it experimental now or is traction being gained and has there been any benefit on the margin front in the density that you gain from that? Thank you.", "Scott Davis", "Well, it's certainly beyond experimental. Alan can fill you in on some details on that.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. I would say that initially that the retailers were really looking at it to optimize their inventories by better utilizing their in-store and D.C. inventories. Shifting inventories sometimes all the way across the United States, in fact the goods were not selling in one part, but they could still get the list prices in another part of the country.", "Now what it shifted to is, how to compete in the local markets, so they are enabling - we are doing some things with late pickups in the evenings for these clients and enabling next day fulfillment in the local territory by utilizing our night source, so they are really using it in a wide variety of ways to both, become more effective with their inventory as well as serve the consumers in a better way to compete with other retailers in the marketplace.", "We have got probably about 25 large retailers underway today and they are using it to ship-to and from-stores, store-to-store, returns to the store and obviously some of those create even more B2B moves, which Kurt talked about earlier.", "Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo", "Is it fair to move the needle on margins or volumes?", "Scott Davis", "It's certainly a part of the B2B retail uptick that we are seeing. Yes.", "Jim Barber", "Yes. Clearly, I think we do it to help density, helps margins in the long-term.", "Operator", "Due to time constraint, our last question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "", "Great. Thank you for giving me a chance on a follow-up. I wanted to see if you could give us a little more data on the comment of the flat export out of Asia. That was, I guess, flat package out of Asia and was there trade down within that or you had premium down and deferred up, or with the kind of 11% growth in international deferred really a phenomenon that's taking place in your European business?", "Scott Davis", "Yes. Jim can get us certainly a little color on that.", "Jim Barber", "Yes. It is. I mean, the network has more expedited this year than last year, but that's something we have to adjust to and the network essentially is flat. It's got a different type of product in it this year, but that's not just with UPS. The whole supply chains across the world are moving that way. It doesn't mean it's going to stay that way in the future, but as it exist right now in the flat discussions we have had, it is flat and it has also got some down trade in it, but we have to then, back to David's comment adjust the network the right way to be able to keep it going forward for the customers and shareholders.", "Scott Davis", "Tom, as said earlier I guess the fact is the export market is not shrinking. It's growing at a slow pace. The reality is expedited is on the fast pace right now. As we get more innovation development, more technology products and the economy gets a little bit better, I would expect to see some better growth in express going forward.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "", "Okay, but that makes the fact is true in your advantage as well.", "Jim Barber", "A little bit. I mean, Europe, quite frankly, you have got obviously big strong ground trans-border networks that are a little bit different, but you've got I think the trade-down to expedite is more predominant in Asia obviously, because of the length of supply chain, so it's more predominant there from my perspective.", "Operator", "I would like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Dolny. Please go ahead, sir.", "Andy Dolny", "Okay, and I will turn it over to Scott for some closing comments.", "Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy. You all know that shippers and consumers around the world have come to depend on UPS to successfully deliver the holidays. Peak season UPS is a combination of months of planning, training and preparation for the ultimate test. The timely delivery is almost double our normal's days worked.", "In advance, I want to thank more than 400,000 dedicated UPSers around the world, who put in the long hours and go the extra mile for our customers this year and I also want to thank all of you for taking part in today's call.

My name is Steven and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we will only take one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Andy Dolny", "Good morning and welcome to UPS fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO. Along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney, International President, Jim Barber, President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we will make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the Company.", "These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2012 Form 10-K and 2013 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Although there were no adjustments to fourth quarter 2013 results, there was a mark-to-market pension adjustment that reduced fourth quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share by $3.15. As a result, in our remarks today all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS' free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.", "The webcast of today's call along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Finally, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate on today's call.", "Thanks for your cooperation. Now, I will turn it over to Scott.", "Scott Davis", "Thanks and good morning. I would like to start my comments today by saying UPS fourth quarter results fell far short of our expectations. However, I do want to reinforce that the core business strategies of UPS remain sound and appropriate for the future.", "Given the compressed calendar between Thanksgiving and Christmas, UPS knew this holiday season will be one of the most challenging ever. Shipments produced by e-commerce significantly exceeded even our most optimistic forecasts as more and more Americans shopped online. In addition, we experienced a much later peak day than expected as purchasing decisions by consumers shifted closer to Christmas.", "The surge in volume and inclement weather strained our network causing delays. We took extraordinary measures and deployed additional people and equipment, placing a greater emphasis on service and cost, yet we did not meet the service standards the UPS historically does at Christmas. Moving forward, UPS will make the necessary investments and operational improvements to ensure we effectively manage peak demand in the future.", "Looking at U.S. Domestic fourth quarter results, clearly, we are not satisfied. At UPS, we conduct a thorough review of peak performance following Christmas, and this year I can assure you we would identify a number of areas to improve and in a moment David Abney will take you through them.", "Turning to the International segment, UPS experienced operating margin expansion on strong growth in export volume. In Supply Chain and Freight, challenges in forwarding negatively impacted results. Reflecting back on 2013, let's start on the economic front. U.S. business activity was constrained by political uncertainty in Washington.", "Now, on a positive note, Europe began to emerge from recession. Also, cross border trade improved in 2012, express shipments out of Asia remains sluggish. Looking specifically at our business, two themes were prevalent in the marketplace. First, e-commerce continues to evolve at a rapid pace, not only here in the United States, but around the world.", "Second, customers put greater emphasis on cost rather than time in transit. UPS has and will continue to adapt our business model and service portfolio to meet their needs. Throughout the first three quarters, UPS adjusted to these market dynamics. We managed our network efficiently, produced an operating profit growth and margin expansion. Clearly, in the fourth quarter, we did not anticipate the magnitude of volume growth and results suffered.", "Looking at 2014, economists around the world are forecasting a slightly brighter outlook. In the U.S., projections call for a stronger GDP, up 2.7%. While in the Eurozone, GDP is expected to grow 1.2% off a relatively flat growth year in 2013. The outlook for Asia calls for continued solid growth with China standing in line with last year about 7.5%. More importantly, global exports are projected to slightly outpace global GDP.", "Another prospect for economic development is the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement passed just last month. To expedite the movement of goods globally by decreasing red tape and promoting more efficient supply chains. While areas remain where additional progress is necessary, this agreement is proof that debate and compromise can produce tangible results. History has shown that economic development benefits from free trade and more should be done to encourage it.", "As I stated at the opening, I am confident in our core business strategies. In the area of operations technology, UPS is ramping up hub modernization efforts. We are seeing the benefits from telematics and route optimization and as a resulted the company is expediting the rollout of Orion. These investments will help UPS become more efficient and responsive to customer needs.", "In addition we are accelerating how UPS data can be used to improve our application of analytics across the network. These models not only of application within our operations but also across our entire business. Serving end consumers around the world, B2C is a critical part of both our heritage and our future and by far the most rapidly changing. We have lead the industry with innovations such as UPS my choice, UPS Access Points and Omnichannel solutions. While we have accomplished a lot, there is still much more to do.", "Regarding industry specific solutions, we have enhanced our healthcare capabilities such as the introduction of UPS Temperature True Saver and UPS Proactive Response. In addition, we will add to our already 6.4 million square feet of healthcare distribution space with several openings planned worldwide in 2014. In the emerging markets, in order to focus on the potential of India, the Middle East and Africa, we structurally separated those markets from Europe in 2013 and established a dedicated team to focus on growth. Expect to see increased investment by UPS in the next year.", "Before turn it over to David, I would like to thank UPS-ers around the world for their exceptional efforts under some fairly difficult peak season conditions. The lessons learned from peak will enable UPS to improve the customer experience, network efficiency and capacity management. We recognize and hold in highest regard the vital role we play in linking 1.1 million shippers to their 8 million customers every day.", "Now I will turn it over to David.", "David Abney", "Thanks. As Scott mentioned, UPS has been working around the clock to determine how to improve peak operations and service performance, ensuring we do not have a repeat of 2013. I am leading a team of senior UPS executives with deep experience in all areas of the business. We have identified areas for improvement and will make the necessary adjustments to our operating plans. This is the first step in an ongoing process.", "Let me begin by providing insight into the major issues that impacted our operations which can be categorized into three main areas. First, e-commerce shipments far exceed peak projections starting with a strong cyber week. Typically volume slows the following week but this year it continued to rise. In fact on eight days during December U.S. delivery volume exceeded our previous company high which was set in 2012. Additionally delivery volume per day during peak was up more than 14% a growth rate almost twice what we planned. Second, last-minute promotions by online retailers drove extraordinary volume growth leading up to Christmas. This helped create the latest peak day ever for UPS, six days after it was expected.", "Another indication of the growing acceptance of e-commerce, there were more than 70 online retailers promoting guaranteed next-day delivery on purchases made as late as 11 PM on December 23rd. Finally, weather events throughout the country, especially in the Southwest further contributed to network disruptions.", "Operations in Texas and Oklahoma were shut down for three-and-a-half days following the ice storms there. Stranded volume became a priority and UPS responded, deploying over 1,000 team members to the area. Ultimately, we had our planned that was based on a very optimistic level of e-commerce shipment growth, but actual results came in significantly higher.", "When the network is stressed to those levels it becomes vulnerable, add to the wave of last-minute online orders, along with significant weather disruptions and processes starting to break down and errors occur. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened.", "Now, let me share how we would prevent this from happening again. We have identified four key areas that UPS must address before peak season next year. First, UPS volume forecasting methods were challenged. The paradigms for planning no longer apply due to the rapidly evolving marketplace.", "The first step, we will begin with increased collaboration with high impact customers to further develop predictive models that incorporate changing consumer behavior and sales promotions. With a better understanding of the impact, these customers we have on our network, UPS will be prepared to make the necessary adjustments.", "That brings me to the second issue we need to address. UPS network capacity. We are in the process of identifying ways to enhance the throughput of our network. We will make appropriate investments such as facility expansions, process automation, job simplification and the acceleration of the technology implementations.", "For example, we plan to expedite the progress of updating our legacy buildings with automation to streamline the thought process. This multiyear undertaking will pay dividends for years to come. In addition, to improve the efficiency of our delivery network, we are expediting the rollout of ORION. This technology has improved UPS routing efficiency.", "As a result, we are accelerating the rollout and we plan to have 45% of the driver rout using the technology by the end of 2014. To do this, we are adding approximately 200 additional dedicated resources to the ORION team, bringing the team headcount to almost 700.", "One final element of capacity management is to better manage the impacts certain customers have on our network during peak. The goal is to ensure we can meet both, customer expectations and our financial objectives.", "A third area for improvement is timely and accurate visibility of shipments. As more customers work with UPS to optimize their supply chains, a growing number of trailers were dropped at our facilities with limited visibility to their contents.", "We will collaborate with customers to obtain package visibility on all trailers before arrival. This will improve UPS tracking and exception reporting and is critical to provide accurate visibility to our customers. Lastly, improved communication with our shippers and receivers is needed.", "UPS must enhance our processes and standards necessary to ensure timely and accurate communication, especially during periods of peak demand and network disruptions. Along with improve visibility for our customers, new package exception codes will be rolled out to improve tracking messages ultimately providing more clarity on shipment progress. In addition proactive notifications will make it possible for our customers to adjust their plans. So clearly our entire team is intensely focused on using the learnings from this peak season to ensure we are prepared for 2014. We have recognize that the UPS brand is a valuable asset to be protected. The steps I just mentioned will allow UPS to build upon our reputation for reliability and service quality.", "Now Kurt will take you through the details of the quarter and guidance for 2014.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, David. As already noted, fourth quarter results fell short of UPS expectations. For the first time in years, UPS did not achieve the typical benefits that we have seen from operational efficiency. As evidenced, compensation and benefit expense increased 7.5% on a daily package volume growth of 6%. Also additional costs were incurred to react to the unprecedented level of volume growth as we attempted to meet service commitments.", "Now I want to review the business segment results for the quarter. In the U.S. domestic, the challenges that David reviewed were detrimental to the segment's financial results. Operating profit declined $178 million and margin contracted to 12.9%. The U.S. incurred unplanned expense this quarter to handle the volume surge. This included hiring and training costs, overtime hours and additional weekend operations. Thousands of extra ad hoc trailer moves drove purchase transportation costs up. In addition with 85,000 seasonal employees, UPS productivity declined driving of 6.2% increase in direct labor hours. Clearly, we didn't operate as smoothly as we normally do.", "The estimated impact of the peak season efforts increased operating costs by $125 million to $150 million. Also revenue was lowered by approximately $50 million in service refunds for missed delivery commitments. UPS did experience strong daily volume growth of 5.6% led by our deferred and ground products. Revenue per piece declined 1.3% as base rate improvements were more than offset by lower fuel surcharges, a 34% growth in UPS SurePost and the service refunds that we mentioned. During the period, the benefits of our route optimization efforts, though, were obvious as miles driven increased a little more than 2% compared to the daily volume growth of 5.6%.", "Looking now at international results. The segment demonstrated continued momentum during the quarter with revenue gains of 5.3% driven by 8.8% package volume growth. Operating profits rose 7.6% to $537 million and operating margin expanded 30 basis points to $15.9 million. Operating profit growth would have been up over 12% when excluding negative currency comparisons. Export daily volume jumped 9.5%, the largest year-over-year gain we have seen in some time. UPS experienced robust demand in Europe, driven by e-commerce, capitalizing on the capabilities of our recently expanded hub in Cologne. In addition, transborder daily volume increased over 18% during peak. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 8.2% with Poland, Italy and Canada leading the way.", "Now turning the supply chain and freight. Total segment revenue declined by 5.8% directly related to our freight forwarding business unit. Operating profit was flat overall at $171 million as improvements in distribution were offset by declines in forwarding and UPS freight. Operating margin overall expanded 30 basis points to 7.4%. UPS freight forwarding revenue declined as international air freight experienced decreases in both tonnage and revenue per case. On a positive note, our brokerage in ocean and forwarding groups both demonstrated good growth and improved profitability.", "In distribution, mid-single-digit revenue growth resulted from improvements in healthcare, retail and UPS mail services. Operating margin expanded slightly as the business unit continues to absorb cost for technology and healthcare facility expansions. ", "UPS Freight, LTL revenue increased 2.3% as a result of increased LTL tonnage and pricing improvements. Revenue per hundredweight increased by 1.6% this quarter as pricing remained stable.", "Now, for an update on our cash flow for the year. UPS generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow during 2013, converting over 120% of net income to cash. This was after making capital expenditures of approximately $2.1 billion. Also during the year, the company distributed over $6 billion to shareowners, including dividends of $2.3 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3.8 billion.", "Looking now at 2014, UPS expects to make share repurchases of $2.7 billion. This will result in over 2% net reduction in outstanding shares and reflects the company's long-term philosophy of returns to shareowners. Capital expenditures are expected increase to $2.5 billion.", "Our allocation of investments will be meaningfully different this year, with much less devoted aircraft. This will be offset though by additions to vehicles and operating technology as well as over $500 million of increased investments in capacity expansion and hub modernization.", "The combination of a slightly improved economic environment and our execution of UPS core business strategies gives us confidence in our 2014 guidance of earnings per share growth of 11% to 16%. We expect the tax rate of 36% in 2014, higher than reported in the first half of last year.", "Regarding guidance for the segments, U.S. Domestic average daily volume is expected to grow between 3% and 4%, moderately above 2014 GDP estimates. Revenue should improve at a slightly faster pace than volume. Increases in base rate rises will remain steady between 2% and 3%. However, they will continue to be masked by customer preference for non-premium products, including continued growth in UPS SurePost.", "Operating margin is expected to be around 14%. Due to higher discount rates, total pension expense will be reduced by approximately $180 million. The majority of this will be reflected in the domestic segment. However, the savings for this segment will be offset by higher healthcare costs. In addition, implementing the network improvements that David described will increase cost by well over $100 million, while providing payback for years to come.", "We expect the positive momentum in the International segment to continue in 2014, with export average daily volume growth between 4% and 6%. Revenue is expected to improve at a slightly slower pace than volume as non-premium export products continue to outpace premium. Operating profit is forecast to grow between 12% and 14%.", "For the Supply Chain and Freight segment, UPS expects mid single-digit annual revenue growth. Operating profits are expected to grow at a low-teen rate with margin expanding to approximately 8%. In the first quarter though, revenue and profit growth will be relatively flat to last year, due to the challenges in our international airfreight. As we look at the first quarter overall, earnings per share growth will be slightly below 10%, due to the higher tax rate and the continued headwind and supply chain and freight.", "In summary, the outlook for 2014 at UPS is positive as improving global economic conditions and the explosive growth of e-commerce provide optimism at UPS. We are going to take the challenges that we faced in the fourth quarter to serve as a springboard to improve our service levels and our productivity going forward. As a result, UPS expects earnings per share to grow within a range of $5.05 to $5.30.", "With that, operator, please open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben Hartford - Baird", "Scott, I wonder if you can just continue down the path on guidance. Obviously when results were previewed earlier this month, you were looking for 10% to 15% earnings growth. I acknowledge it was a preliminary number. Now the range has taken up slightly, but the buyback is being reduced. You are making infrastructure related investments, which I think are appropriate, but when we do think about, it looks like the core assumption is greater than expected. Can you talk about some of the drivers there? It sounds like the cadence is for accelerating improvement through the year, but you can talk about the decision to take the full year guidance up, even with the buyback that is coming down slightly for 2014?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, as we dug through took a little closer look at the momentum of the business units, sharpened our focus on the investments we were going to make and took a hard look at that, it looks like a very competent range that we have got. I will make one comment, though, and that is that the buyback is in line with what we been communicating. Clearly 2013 was a catch-up year because we had the held back in 2012 on repurchases but that 2.7% gets us right in the line with the $8 billion or so that we had committed to three years ago. So at least for the numbers we have provided and I think the communication that buyback is right in line.", "Scott Davis", "Ben, I would add also that, the thing we feel good about, 2014, is we see strength in all three segments. It has really been since 2010 that we saw balanced growth at all three segments. We have had some weakness in cross border trade in 2011 and 2012. We see that improving in '14. Supply Chain & Freight is going to show good growth in domestic. It has performed quite well for the last several years, with the exception of fourth quarter '13.", "Ben Hartford - Baird", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Good morning. So I understand, obviously it's a little bit disappointing in terms of just that there is some of the operational issues but it is the high cost problem to have that much volume coming in and I suppose you could say, maybe there is a silver lining in terms of highlighting the customers that there are constraints on the network and perhaps the value of your network. So I guess what I want to ask you is, do you think this provides an opportunity to guys get more value from the customers in terms of pricing? And if so, what type of timeframe would it take to see that come in?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, Tom, I think David did a pretty good job of walk through how we are going to approach next peak, but clearly as a team we are going to evaluate many options to make sure we don't ever repeat the 2013 peak. Now I would say it is safe to say that we are going to evaluate every alternative out there. We haven't made all the final decisions as of this point in time that we know we need to manage the impact customers have on us during the peak. But the overall objective for us, we have to meet customer expectations and we have to meet our financial objectives. So over the next few months we will make more decisions in this area.", "Scott Davis", "And clearly, Tom, the top priority is adding capacity and investing in this growth business. So we are happy to do that.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "And is there any impact on the pricing dynamic? I am really to ask about pricing and whether it is in your positive effect on pricing from what happened?", "Scott Davis", "Well, that is something we are evaluate as we are really early on this process. David is leading this committee to evaluate next peak. Every thing is on the table and that will be one of the things that will be on the table to look at.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays", "Hi, good morning, everyone. I want to talk about what was that, seems to be a pretty good outcome in your international segment and if I look at your guidance, I actually think you are guiding to up the margins for international. So can you talk about how the mix has changed on the export front and within the continent in Europe and what you are doing to drive those better profit outcomes or at least expectations for better profit outcomes in 2014?", "David Abney", "Yes, clearly as we have been saying over the last couple quarters, we are improving momentum. Each quarter has gotten stronger and stronger. As we get past the currency headwinds we are looking for great things to come out of the international segment. So I will have Jim Barber fill you a little more on Europe and what's going on there.", "Jim Barber", "Okay. So, Brandon, I think the core underlying response has to be that that network in Europe for us continues to perform very, very nicely. You heard in some of the opening comments, the expansion of Cologne. We could see the benefits of that through peak season. We have also continued to enhance the ground network and quite frankly put some new solutions in the market for some of our global customers that are really driving the growth today. That's a lot of what underpins some of the growth you see today and then we will valuate going forward what's next. But effectively, that network in Europe continues to mature and pay long-term benefits for all investment over the years. So we absolutely see that continuing and you can see in some of the countries where the investments we make some two, three years ago continue to pay off today. So we are very bullish on that.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon - Bernstein", "Good morning, guys. Kurt, when you mentioned the guidance for domestic, you talked about $100 million of extra cost. I am assuming that's OpEx. Could you talk a little bit about the nature of that and whether that's going to be kind of a one-time addition for the year as you are rolling out ORION, and it may come back a little bit or if it's going to be just an added level of spend within the operation to keep the network little more resilient.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Certainly the lion share in 2014 will be operating expense that's involved in the rapid expansion and one-time costs, so we don't see this as a major structural cost addition, but clearly there are some things we are going to do teeing up the teams, having 700 people deploying ORION and other things are going to accelerate both, cost but should provide great benefits in the years to come.", "Maybe I could have Myron talk a little bit about ORION and why we are doubling our bets on the pace of rollout on that.", "Myron Gray", "Good morning, David. As you heard David Abney alluded to earlier, we actually saw a great benefit from ORION at peak season. While ORION grew almost 6%, our miles driven were down to 2%, so we are going to ramp up our ORION team and move the total number of drivers deployed from just over 10% to up to 45% for this year.", "Along with that, David also alluded to the hub modernization project, which actually kicks off this coming Friday in North California, so we are looking forward to this investment yielding dividends for years to come.", "David Vernon - Bernstein", "Excellent. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. Scott, I guess, I want to come back to Tom's question on the pricing. I guess, when you talk before about better managing certain customer impact on the network, just given that you have kind of kept stressing the financial objectives, if we are going to see e-commerce continue to push that peak season later and later and obviously December 23rd, it sounds like that's about as latest you can physically get with your physical network. It is the [answer] have to be that you raise pricing incrementally until that peak day to alter customer behavior to move it earlier in this season or is there something else you can do. I guess, I just want to understand, does it have to be price or are there other things you can do to handle that level of an increase the last minute.", "Scott Davis", "Clearly, Ken, it doesn't have to be price, so we are going to look at all the alternatives. Obviously, we are trying to move shipments forward doing earlier pickups. It is something that will help us. We as you would expect spend a lot time with customers, and since the peak season working with them. The Omnichannel is becoming more prevalent every day. I work of several brick-and-mortar people who were evaluated next year perhaps that are having their big sale the 23rd on the website. People will do it in the store that will allow people to go in the store and pick it up, so in other words you get 50% off in store 40% off on the website. There is a variety of alternatives out there that could change it.", "We know that there is still going to be an issue. I mean, every year there is going to be e-commerce is bigger at Christmas, so we have got to adapt our systems, so I think it's all the above. Alan, you may want to add some?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. I would just say that there is tremendous amount of planning that goes on between us and certainly our largest customers, but we are going to need to take that to a whole new level to ensure that we are keeping our promises and they are able to keep theirs, so I think [heard] from David earlier and what our customers are looking for right now is commitment and insurance that we will take the necessary actions to make sure this won't happen again and that's really where our focus is right now and you heard some of the things that David was talking about in terms of capacity management, visibility and investing in the business to make sure that we are going to handle the business. Again, part of that is better communication with our customers, so that we are very well aligned in terms of being able to make the service that their customers expect.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Kurt, can I ask you for a little bit more color on how to think about the impacts in the fourth quarter from each one of these items, so when we think about the challenges from the peak and the resources you had to deploy last-minute and the weather, if you try to tease it out, what do you think the right level of earnings would have been. Would it have been the original guidance, or is the mix you are sort of going to repeat? Because, I am not sure how to think about what core earnings - like things got better, but maybe the cost have to repeat in ways in the fourth quarter that we need to keep in mind as we model going forward. So any color around kind of how to think about those buckets would be helpful.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Bill, certainly, it's something we have looked at very closely and you know we did have a significant amount of excess cost somewhere between $125 million and $150 million. Plus, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about another $50 million of service refunds that lowered revenue. So we certainly would have been within our guidance without those conditions. When the network gets stressed and there is that much of an increase after years of fairly modest growth, clearly some weak areas showed up and that did snowball for us. So clearly, the fourth quarter was a tough one for us. If you look at the October, November, October was pretty much on target. We did see November a little below our plans but I think that that's primarily the issue of the later Thanksgiving and the fact that the holidays started later. In fact, if you recall I even mentioned in our last quarterly call about both the risks and the opportunities of a compressed peak season and for better or worse we ended up seeing opportunity with tremendous compression of demand but the risk of operations, especially with some of the incredible ice storms in the Southwest that was really the worst area for us. So we are putting this one in the history books. I think you heard David give a sense of our absolute determination to learn from this and to create flexibility and capacity. We are substantially increasing our investments in our facility modifications. Myron mentioned hub modernization. That's something we are very excited about. The technology has come long ways and we can, we think, very effectively retrofit a number of our buildings. In fact, maybe I could have David talk just a little bit about the technology and why we are feeling like this is a great time to invest in it.", "David Abney", "Yes. This technology is something we have been utilizing. The difference now is that the capacity, so the speed of the technology and the footprint is such that it will now fit into our existing footprint. So real excited about that. Myron mentioned the first one in North Bay in California but there will be others that will be progressing right behind that one. But you know, there's other things we are doing to increase capacity too. We are automating more of the small sorts and increasing input capacity in some of our main transit hubs and we are doing facility expansions on some that we already have the books. We are just speeding up and a lot of job simplification where we can do next generation small shorthauls where it takes some of the intellectual capital out and it allows us to make changes more as this peak when we had some of those most fluctuations and changes we had to make.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Christian Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citi", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just on the back of the last question, just trying to think about the core operating of the business or co-operations and profitability of the business. Post what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year, does the dynamic of profitability would indeed see some sort of change at all when you think about what ultimately the volume potential of this segment of your business could be? Does that skew things, either more positively or negatively when you look at it? It would seem, based on the guidance, where all the puts and takes that maybe there is an assumption of slightly less profitability in B2C but just want to make sure I understand.", "Scott Davis", "Yes, I think generally we feel good about the direction of B2C. You have seen the progress UPS has made over the last two or three years in improving the margins in the B2C business. We are going to use this technology to help create density in the area of B2C. So I think this is an outlier for what you saw in December of this year. Again we have been through over 100 successful peaks and this is an outlier. You will not see another one of these hopefully for the next 100 years at UPS. We have a lot of intensity there. But I feel good about the direction of B2C and what we are doing with technology to improve the profitability there.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, and certainly its not only about B2C. We are investing and creating a wide array of capabilities for healthcare, for technology, you name it and a lot of the investments we have made create flexible network are paying dividends there. So as always, we have got a great array of different customers and the B2C clearly was a challenge in December but we feel pretty good going forward that the mix of business will be profitable.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citi", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, guys. I am just trying to walk through the cadence of how things have transpired over the last couple of quarters and now making sense at where we are, so I mean back half of last year was clearly a story of profitability being masked by pension and currency.", "It sounded like when you were giving your guidance that healthcare slipped in there as a problem. I know that you guys took steps to kind of mitigate some of that increased inflation that you were expecting in the back half of last year, so I would be curious how that's playing in. Obviously this difficult peak also played in, so I guess I am trying to get a sense of what you think underlying growth looks like for '14 when you strip some of that stuff out.", "Are you just being conservative in terms of the underlying growth of the overall business? Because it puts you well below kind of run rate when I do all those puts and takes. Then when I think about the decisions that you made last peak and how those inform earnings growth this year, so it feels like to have another year where you choose servicing the customer over profitability in terms of capping volumes to make sure that as shareholders get the growth that they need as well, so I am just trying to understand.", "I mean, maybe '15 or you guys are good at what you do, you are able to translate that into very profitable growth and I think that's what a few of the questions before were trying to get at, but it doesn't sound like you are confident in that for '14, so I know there is a lot of there. I am just trying to get a better sense of how you feel about the cadence of the next kind of 24 months here.", "Scott Davis", "Great. You have given me a wide array of choices to pick which question I am going to answer, Justin. I think, we are seeing '14 as a year in which we are going to absolutely address the issues that popped up in the fourth quarter, so that is job one. There is no question.", "We are going to spend extra money operationally. We are going to accelerate investments and we are little cautious about exactly how the next peak turns out. It is another compressed holiday season although we get one extra day.", "On the other hand, we are not in any way anticipating or forecasting in a major problem, so is the balance right now more on reinvestment and refinement of the network? Absolutely. Hopefully, all of this will come together and we will have great results going forward, but we are happy to reinvest right now and accelerate some things that have been on the drawing board. As a result, yes, 2014 is a little muted in the domestic side anyway compared to where it might have been, but will be a passing phase.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. As that reflect back on the 2012 or 2013, frankly that the primary headwind excluding pension expense and currency was international air freight. We had some challenges, cross-border trade grew less than GDP last year, little bit better in 2013. Forwarding side, international freight forwarding was weak due to too much capacity. We try to see those things level out in '14, so I feel pretty good.", "As I said earlier I feel good about the balance. That we see a good domestic, we see good international package and we see good supply chain and freight performance in 2014. 11% to 16%, again, is back up in our long-term target area where it should be the margins of kind of what we told you a couple years ago in our long-term targets, but we have room for improvement. Unfortunately, we can't keep all the pension benefit this year because of healthcare cost.", "David Abney", "Just one thing I want to react to, Justin, and this is David Abney, but I don't want to speak from the cross functional theme and we are still early in the process, where we have made a lot of progress in identifying all of the contributing factors and we are also are much further along than I thought in putting the answers together, what we need to do to ensure the 2014 is not going to be a repeat of 2013, so I thought I heard just a little indecision that in your voice about how we would do for 2014.", "We believe, we don't believe. We are very confident that we have a plan put in place that's going to take care of the volume on 2014. We are not hoping that maybe it comes indifferent, but it's not only about capacity it's about increasing our forecasting methods with our customers. It's about improving visibility and it's about the communications back and forth with our customers, so the overall plan and as Kurt said earlier, there will be some operating costs into this year but it's going to pay dividends in years to come and when you increase the funnel, you increase the capacity then that takes care of a lot of challenges that could come in the future.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the answers, Kurt.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to ask about the buyback expectations. I know it's in line with what you guys have been talking about and it looks like you are using about 100% of the free cash flow for buyback and dividend but I guess I am just wondering why you don't feel comfortable being more aggressive in sort of ease into that $6 billion plus of cash. I guess, there is something you are saving that for? So Scott, are you any more and less hopeful about finding a better place for that cash this year?", "Scott Davis", "So Scott, I do think that we have been consistent with our distribution policy and again we are going to have big shareholder distribution in 2014, as you said over 100% of net income, is the plan. But we still do see opportunities to reinvest in the business. As I talked about earlier, there's lot of opportunities for us in the healthcare arena, in emerging markets as we go forward, in the B2C area. So I think there will be a mixture of acquisitions as we move forward.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen, and I hope you survive in the deep freeze of Atlanta.", "Scott Davis", "I have, as a matter of fact, a story to tell you. I slept in the floor of a hotel lobby the night before last. Pretty glamorous being a CEO.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Kurt, I think as you talk about some of your network enhancements for this year to deal with the growth of e-commerce, it sounds like a lot of infrastructure enhancements. So I think you indicated you guys weren't really going to invest in your aircraft fleet. So does that mean, as we get into the peak season, you will continue and maybe rely more on outsourced providers of aircraft during the holiday season? Am I thinking about that right?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, it will be a slight increase but we did take a number of 767s this year completing our multiyear purchase. So we are in great shape as far as air capacity. We always have to rely on third-party to top off the excess demand during peak. So that won't be dramatically different, but no, we are in great shape. We have got, by far, the youngest fleet in the industry. We will, at least for the immediate, the next several years, don't anticipate needs for any aircraft purchases. So that's part of why we are in such good shape cash wise and are happy to now begin to reinvest in some of this hub modernization and automation.", "Scott Davis", "And they are all saying, you don't build a church for Easter. It's a little bit way it is for airplanes for December 23. You really can't buy an airplane just for one day. We will manageable this properly. We lease aircraft where necessary and we will make sure we have proper capacity.", "David Abney", "With those eight additional 767s, the number of leased aircraft was not a primary factor at WorldPort. It was much more about unload doors for trailers that were coming in and that is something that we can certainly correct.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thanks for your time this morning. Scott, I hope you get to sleep again in bed tonight.", "Scott Davis", "You got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.", "Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company", "Good morning, everyone. Hi, Scott, by the way, we really appreciate the dedication. I am pretty sure of their value by sleeping on the floor so that's got to drop right through the bottomline.", "Scott Davis", "I think it was a good deal. Yes.", "Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company", "We are spending a lot of time, obviously talking about the domestic challenges and a little bit of time in terms of a lot of the opportunities in Europe. Obviously, some of that network adjustments seem to keep going on in terms of Asia to U.S. Could you guys feel that you are well balanced there and as we get maybe a little bit of a slowdown in the emerging markets that everybody is worried about recently? Does that impact your vision on global trade and how you allocate your resources or where the growth comes from?", "Scott Davis", "Jim why don't you go ahead and talk a little bit about the areas outside of Europe.", "Jim Barber", "Sure, so I guess, and the last question we talked about the network and this question, they are very linked responses. First of all, we like our assets that are out there but when you get back to some of the opening comments about Bali, what's going on now and where these trade agreements are going to us, one of obligation, just to be able to take a look at these networks. I am really specifically talking about Asia now in the Americas. To align those to where the puck is going, so it doesn't necessarily mean new asset, but it might mean redeploying them in different ways based upon what the consumers are telling us and our customers from across the globe, so we are in the middle of that piece of work right now. We are very happy with our networks and the way they are performing. You can see that in some of the results, but we also think we have to keep one step ahead based on where these trade agreements are going and some of the decision these countries will make in the next couple years.", "I think that the fact that as you look at 2014, solid growth is projected for the developing world, developed world I should say, so the United States and Europe, and I think that also bodes well for UPS.", "Looking at almost 8% to 10% increase is consensus for the U.S. this year and the global economy the same, so I think as you get into more stable I just wouldn't call it robust economy, but a more stable economy. See in Europe and U.S. strengthens is going to help us a lot. (Inaudible), so we are going to continue to invest in emerging markets, big part of our future, but for the short to medium-term developed world going - good for us.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Company", "Thanks very much. Hi, guys. Thank you very much for the time. Most of my questions have been answered more than once, so thank you very much. I just had one thing I wanted to understand. When you talk about having to hire people kind of at the last instance, I am not sure I understand the timing of that. When do you bring on those additional people to handle the extra volume.", "I mean, I sort of think that those 1,000 or so people you move to the Southwest, coming from other parts of the company, but as you got closer to the peak, how do you really get those people from or how does that work, so could you just explain that one for me?", "Scott Davis", "Certainly, hiring that number of people in the span of a month-and-a-half or so is a big challenge, especially when we have to react late, but Myron can talk a little bit about the joys and challenges of bringing on such a large workforce.", "Myron Gray", "Helane, it's like a delicate ballet. We are constantly assessing where the volume is and bringing all resources to meet those challenges. As has been talked about many times, we actually added 30,000 people above where we planned.", "Let me also allude to the fact that we believe that our operating strategy is sound, and remind you that through the first three quarters of last year, we were able to balance average daily volume with ours and have the appropriate spread, so we are bringing on these people as needed and it's a challenge because you had a 16% increase in our peak day over last year, but we believe that those are good peak season jobs. We got all the required people in place on time, but were [by] a significant storm that we saw, not only in the Southwest, but the Midwest and Northeast, so I think we are in good shape.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Helane, on the economic impact of that, there is a point of diminishing returns and trying to bring that many people on and have them be productive quickly clearly was one of the drags in the quarter, especially when we had to get so much more because of the volume increase, but those are great jobs. Many of us started as the company as Christmas hires myself included.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Company", "Me too. Although I am not with you anymore I could do that in college.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Great. Hopefully, we worked too hard.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Company", "Yes. I would say so.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Okay.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Company", "Thank you.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Ross - Stifel", "Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Why don't you just a little bit rising healthcare costs. You mentioned, they are going to eat up most of the pension benefit expected for 2014. I wanted to see if that $100 million rough increase in healthcare cost is expected every year through the new union labor agreement or if it's one-time for some reason. It can't be all due to any back problems comes with sitting on the floor.", "Scott Davis", "That's not work-related any way. No. The biggest impact is and we have talked about this than in prior calls that certainly the rollout of some of the additional parts of the Affordable Care Act is adding over $100 million for us, so that's the biggest one-time issue. Of course, healthcare inflation is an issue that is certainly a concern for many of us. So that's been an area also that's been discussed and are in our discussions with our employees but the biggest impact is some one-time additional expenses with the added cost per head and some of those things that's driving up costs for a employee intensive company like UPS.", "Scott Davis", "In this year, we saw more, in 2014 more of it, because of things like the reinsurance fee per employee that you didn't see last year. So I think it is going to be quite as dramatic as you move forward.", "David Ross - Stifel", "Okay, so one time step up in cost but not just one time cost that is going to go away next year.", "Scott Davis", "One time step up in cost. Right.", "David Ross - Stifel", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask you with regard to your net exposure to foreign currencies and if you could share a little bit about the UPS sensitivity to a potential 10% change in some of those currencies? Thanks.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we are actually pretty well hedged for 2014. So for the major currencies of the Euro, the Pound, the Canadian Dollar, we have got spreads in place pretty well with the floor not to far off where the markets are today and some upward potential. So that is a different story than last year. One area that presents some challenges though is some of these emerging market currencies are showing quite a bit of volatility. So that is a little bit of a risk to us but it is likely to be offset by the benefit in the developed markets that we are seeing.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify what's implied in guidance specific to the U.S. domestic, you mentioned $125 million to $150 million added cost that is a weather, incremental hires, seasonal hires mix and the $50 million of service refunds and then I think you just answered, the $100 million is above that. So is what's implied in your guidance that you are going to have about the same seasonal staffing next year and just if we can hone in a little bit more on that, please? Thanks.", "Scott Davis", "No, we do not expect to have to hire that many people. I mean a part of that was the catch-up and the challenges of some of the unexpected volume. Looking at the peak for next year, there is one additional day in the period. Christmas as a day later. So the volume that builds up over the weekend in the late surge will be a little smoother. So, hopefully we do hire a lot of employees because of good robust demand but as I said, there is a point of reduced benefit as some of the stresses hit the network that caused us to hire more people than was optimal. So we would expect to have less hiring this year unless there is just incredible growth beyond the current expectations.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks. And that increases predominantly, Orion, the $100 million?", "Scott Davis", "For the added cost for this year, you would see acceleration of Orion. It is some of the operating changes as we are automating buildings. It is a number of things. IT expense will also be involved as we make some investments especially collaborating with customers to get detailed package information even on trailers that haven't reached UPS yet. So it's a laundry list of things that we will be working on to enhance our capabilities and ultimately make us more productive and streamlined.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison Landry - Credit Suisse", "Thanks for taking my question. Based on the acceleration of the Orion rollout, is it fair to assume that you can complete the full implementation to all of the U.S. drivers by the end of 2015? And I was wondering if you could give us some broad parameters for how to think about the cost savings, once the initiative is fully rolled out? For example, you said, each driver was able to drive one less mile per day per year, what would that mean for annual cost savings? Just trying to get some broad strokes on that.", "David Abney", "Yes, the time line, and there will still be several more years that we will be ramping well through 2016 for the full rollout of Orion. It is a major undertaking. In general, as a ballpark number, saving a mile per day per driver generates about $50 million of reduced operating expense for the company. And as we get a little farther along then we will fill you in more on the very specific experience that we are seeing because we are getting better and better at doing it and the benefits are kicking in quicker. So this is a net investment year, though as we ramp up and next year will also be a year with significant velocity. So it's a little early for us to lock in on any specific external targets, but so far so good on that front.", "Allison Landry - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Fantastic. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.", "Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital", "Good morning. Could you please share some insight into freight forwarding? What happened this quarter versus the market and maybe make some of the comparison as to the outlook for '14. Thank you very much.", "Scott Davis", "Sure. I will have Jim talk about that.", "Jim Barber", "If you look at forwarding, a couple of quarters ago I talked about concentration in a couple of verticals as well as military. We said, we needed to change that obviously in a business like UPS doesn't change in a dime and so we take a prudent approach to that. We have worked through that in the last couple of quarters.", "We feel like the first quarter, as the opening comments alluded to, will be the wraparound for us. Two-fold will be nice growth quarters for us in both, tonnage as well as revenue quality, so we have been working through this. I would say that on the international air freight side, but there's three other pieces to that business that we feel like are performing very nicely. That being the North American forwarding piece, the brokerage piece and our Ocean Freight business and we built for a couple of years, so we feel like we are turning the corner on it along with the small package side and you will see that the as each quarter rolls out in '14.", "Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital", "Any specific guidance in terms of growth versus market? How do you expect your positioning to change compared to last year?", "Jim Barber", "Well, I would only say, the guidance we have put out is pretty solid and we will stick with that in each quarter. we will kind of update as we go.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. We are looking for a mid single-digit revenue growth for the segment in aggregate and margins of about 8%, so we have got a lot of good stuff going on, the ocean is performing very well and we are helping customers find that balance of ocean and air forwarding, so that you should see more good stuff coming from that.", "Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital", "Overall, the headwind from industry overcapacity, would you see that easing or how do you see it trend compared to last year.", "Jim Barber", "Yes. This is Jim. We have to move on. We have others on the line, so we are running out of a little time here, so we will save that for our individual call.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research", "Thank you. I got a question on cash deployment. You basically have one times your EBITDA and debt on the books maybe a little less. Historically $6.5 billion is that the right amount of cash for you guys to keep on the books is probably closer to the $2 billion to $3 billion range?", "I heard the answer, we are thinking of making some acquisitions, but the number of acquisitions I can think of that require that much cash is a very short list. Why aren't we thinking about continuing to share repurchase or continuing to plough more of this cash back to investors?", "Scott Davis", "Well, Jeff, we continue to talk about that, and the balance sheet we do show about $5 billion at year-end 2013, so we did deploy quite a bit of cash as we said over $6 billion to shareowner's last year. We will continue to look at that.", "Clearly, we are here to do what's right for investors and customers and we will continue to look at that. We are basically fulfilling our commitment of returning at least 100% of net income to shareowners and the discussion of whether to accelerate when to accelerate that, that clearly is something that we talk about frequently, so for now we will keep doing what we said we would do and living up to our commitment, so you guys can anticipate and if there will likely be time to impress, we get even more aggressive.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", " I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dolny.", "Andy Dolny", "Yes. I will turn it over to Scott for some closing comments.", "Scott Davis", "Thanks, Andy. Before we go, I want to just take a minute to recognize one of our team members who was participating on our final earnings call. Andy Dolny has announced his retirement after almost 32 years as a dedicated UPS-er. Those of you on the call have come to know him in his investor relations role over the last several years. And as I speak, the rest of our team, in thanking Andy for his wonderful service to our company, he keeps our meetings quite interesting and he always represents the investors' perspective well.", "Andy, all of us around this table and obviously UPS will miss you and we thank you for your contribution. By the way, Andy will be in the office for next several weeks. I am sure he will be in touch with most of you before he leaves.", "With that, thanks so much for listening to the call today and we will talk to you next quarter.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Steven and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we will only take one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkinson, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Joe Wilkinson", "Good morning and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney, International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the Company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2013 Form 10-K which is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Although there were no adjustments to first quarter 2014 results, there was an adjustment related to the attempted acquisition of TNT that increased first quarter 2013 diluted earnings per share by $0.04. As a result in our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons were referred to adjusted results. In addition we will discuss UPS\u2019 free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today\u2019s call along with a reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.", "Before we review the details of the quarter I want to announce that we plan to hold an Investor Conference later this year. The 2014 UPS Investor Conference will be held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York on November 13th. We look forward to updating you on our strategy, demonstrating our technology and sharing our plans for the future. You will be receiving a same day invitation soon with more details. And just as a reminder, as on previous calls please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.", "Thanks for your cooperation. Now I will turn it over to Scott.", "Scott Davis", "Thanks Joe. Welcome to your first call and good morning to everyone. UPS first quarter performance produced mixed results. International demonstrated strong volume growth and margin expansion and a 8% increase in export shipments. Supply chain and freight delivered results that were about as we expected, however our U.S. domestic segment fell short due to the unusually harsh weather during the first quarter.", "We pride ourselves on being an all-weather company, but the intensity of this year\u2019s winter storm season produced challenging conditions. Buildings across UPS network were forced to cease operations somewhere in the U.S. on 34 days during the quarter. These weather events not only led to increased cost but also influenced UPS product and customer mix contributing to lower yields. We saw business to business shipments slow as manufacturers, distributors and retailers closed shop.", "On the other hand snowbound consumers took to the Internet to make their purchases. Clearly UPS results in the U.S. reflect both the loss revenue and the additional cost associated with these storms and Kurt will provide more details in just a moment.", "While we are yet to see the first quarter U.S. GDP numbers, it\u2019s safe to say that growth will be slower due to weather. The good news is that spring has arrived and we expect the pace of U.S. economic growth to pick up as 2014 progresses. In Europe the economy is showing signs of recovery and faster growth. Yet as the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, that pace may slow. Economic expansion in Asia has remained steady with mid single digit growth and in Latin America expectations call for increased merchandise exports. The economic benefit of global trade is clearly visible in both established and emerging economies. Trade per modes economic expansion creates jobs, makes companies more competitive and lowers prices for consumers.", "Congress now needs to act to pass a trade promotion authority bill or TPA that supports economic growth in job creations in the U.S. TPA gives the administration authority to pursue trade agreements that meet objectives laid out by Congress. We strongly encourage swift passage of TPA as there are currently three important trade packs pending that provide real economic benefits and TPA will clearly increase their chances of success. The expansion of global trade is an important catalyst to the UPS growth strategy. Recently our management and board of directors conducted detailed review of UPS\u2019 long term strategic initiatives and identified key opportunities that bring long term value to both customers and shareowners. The updates we received were encouraging. UPS is on the right path to ensure that our solutions meet the ever changing needs of the marketplace. We will continue to stay focused on providing industry specific solutions as we invest in our healthcare capabilities and develop omni-channel solutions for the retail industry.", "In addition we review the implementation of the operational technology projects or ORION and Hub Automation. On the international front Jim Barber will bring you up today this morning on how we\u2019re expanding the UPS global network in both developed and emerging economies as well as what we\u2019re doing to serve end consumers around the world.", "In support of our healthcare strategy UPS announced several investments during the quarter including the acquisition of Polar Speed. This addition to our global healthcare network will provide improved access to the important UK market as well as unique cold chain transportation capabilities.", "Also UPS opened new healthcare distribution facilities in Canada and Mexico and thus plan to expand with additional facilities in Brazil and Chile later this year, further increasing our capabilities in Latin America. Adding to these industry specific solutions, we've expanded our distribution network in North America for retail and manufacturing clients. These investments add almost 500,000 square feet to our footprint at three key distribution sites in Kentucky, California and Alberta, Canada.", "Now before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to give you a quick update on what we\u2019ve been doing regarding peak season. During the last couple of months we have met with UPS\u2019 largest customers. We are working collectively to improve forecast and accuracy, increase visibility of shipments and improve mutual planning capabilities. Our shared goal is to enhance the end consumers\u2019 experience. In addition, David Abney and his team are on track with the system changes, facility automation and capacity enhancements we discussed last quarter.", "These improvements will provide better flexibility of peak and will deliver service and productivity gains throughout the year. As we continue to implement these enhancements, we\u2019ll keep you updated on our progress.", "Now Kurt will take you through the details of the quarter.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well thanks Scott and good morning every one. Our goal today is not to make this call all about weather but unfortunately it did significantly weigh on earnings. So we\u2019ll have to spend a minute or two talking about it. The difficult weather environment this quarter created severe operational challenge that increased cost and also pressured demand. Unfortunately due to our diversified portfolio, weather is not the only story. Most notably we\u2019re encouraged by the strong momentum in international and the positive results in the supply chain and trade segment. We expect both of these to continue.", "Now let\u2019s review the segment results. Our U.S. domestic operating profit was 927 million down 158 million with margin contracting 220 basis points. Clearly the impact of weather was reflected in the bottom line. We estimate that the profitability was lowered by almost $200 million. This includes the additional expense from loss productivity, snow removal, increased utilities, in addition it was a drag on revenue due to perishable demand and increased service refunds.", "UPS experienced service disruptions in the network on more than half of the operating days in the quarter, materially increasing network costs as we attempted to navigate around the many storms. For example, a substantial rise in the number of delayed trailers slowed network operations and pushed direct labor hours up 5.4% including a 20% increase in overtime.", "U.S. domestic revenue increased 2.6% to $8.5 billion. We were encouraged to see strong demand in the U.S. as daily volume was up 4.2%. Ground products were up 4.4% driven by SurePost, which grew more than 50%.", "UPS deferred products grew 6.3% and Next Day Air was 1.5% higher due to increases in Next Day Air Saver package. B2C shipping contributed broadly to gains across all products, while B2B improved slightly primarily from ecommerce including omni-channel customers. Average revenue per package declined by 1.5%, days rate increases were more than offset by changes in customer and product mix slightly lower fuel surcharges and weather also contributed to yield declines.", "Couple of interesting things we noticed. Customer mix shifted a bit as large accounts were able to more effectively manage around storms. Also B2B volume was clearly reduced by weather events whereas in contrast B2C growth remained robust as consumers were able to continue shopping online, pushing our residential delivery mix to almost 44%.", "Next, the international segment results. We are encouraged by the positive business trends we\u2019re seeing especially in Europe. UPS international revenue was up 5% to $3.1 billion. Operating profit increased 12% and operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 14%. Over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve been making adjustments to optimize network efficiencies. These improvements coupled with the increased shipments contributed to margin expansion during the quarter. Our international export volume was 7.7% higher, with Europe leading the way with growth to all regions of the world. Strong demand for UPS transporter products increased intra-European exports by more than 15%.", "Non-U.S. domestic volume jumped more than 8% led by Germany, Poland, The UK and Canada. Export yields on a currency neutral basis were down 3.2% negatively impacted by shorter trade lanes and changing product mix as non-premium products grew by 13% with premium up 4%.", "Looking now at supply chain and trade, operating profit was up 3.5% to $148 million led by the forwarding and distribution business units. Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 6.8%. In forwarding, shipments and tonnage increased while market conditions drove revenue per kilo lower. The ocean forwarding and brokerage businesses both experienced solid revenue gains and improved profitability. The distribution unit continued to expand its footprint with the facility openings that Scott mentioned earlier. The retail and healthcare sectors combined to produce mid-single digit revenue growth. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 9% despite the expansion cost. UPS freight saw both pressure on demand and higher operating cost due to weather. Revenue was up slightly due to a 3% improvement in LTL revenue per 100 weight that was offset by a 2% tonnage decline. Operating profit was lowered by increased network cost associated with the difficult conditions.", "Looking now at cash in our balance sheet, the ability to generate free cash flow on a consistent basis is a hallmark of UPS. This quarter, UPS once again had a conversion rate well in excess of 100% generating 1.9 billion in cash. Capital expenditures were about 320 million. The pace of investment will accelerate as the year progresses. We expect capital expenditures to reach 2.5 billion for 2014, many of the network enhancements and operational technology projects will ramp up during the second and third quarters. Regarding share under our distributions, UPS paid 596 million in dividends reflecting the 8.1% increase announced by the board in February. In addition, the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $660 million.", "On the labor front, we are pleased with the progress that\u2019s been made and while we\u2019ve not yet received final word from the Teamsters we feel it\u2019s an appropriate time to share with you some key elements of the new agreement. A detailed presentation will be made available on the IR website upon implementation of the contract. The new agreement includes reasonable wage and benefit increases as well as flexibilities that will improve service and profitability. UPS has devoted substantial time and effort working to help the Teamsters better understand our cost structures and the changes needed to provide attractive benefits in the future while remaining competitive in the industry.", "Sponsorship of healthcare plans has become expensive largely due to high healthcare inflation trends and legislation like the Affordable Care Act. After much evaluation, we determine that the best path for UPS was to move our union employees to multiemployer healthcare plans. In simple terms, UPS is moving from a defined healthcare benefit plan to a defined contribution environment with the contribution set for the duration of the contract. Once the new contract is implemented, the responsibility for proving medical coverage will be assumed by Teamster plans.", "As a part of this settlement UPS will also remove existing post-retirement healthcare liabilities from our balance sheet. This obligation for future retirees as well as ongoing coverage for active employees will become the responsibility of the multi-employer plans. When we transfer this liability to the Union, UPS expects to make a significant cash payment to these plans and record a one-time charge. As I said, more details will come in the future when the contract is finalized.", "Looking now at our expectations for the rest of the year. While we took a hit in the first quarter our expectation for the remainder of the year are unchanged. In U.S. domestic, we still anticipate operating margin of approximately 14% for the remainder of the year. We expect a little higher package growth somewhere between 4% and 5% resulting from the gains in UPS share post.", "Looking more closely at the quarters, as we discussed back in January we will be incurring at least 100 million in extra operating expense. This expense is related to network and systems enhancements as well as the accelerated deployment of ORION. The lion's share of this expense will weigh on the second and third quarters by about $0.02 to $0.03 each.", "Our expectations for international and the supply chain and freight segments remain unchanged. So overall we are encouraged by the positive trends we\u2019ve seen across the business and anticipate the remaining three quarters to perform as we originally guided. However, due to the challenging start to 2014, we expect to be at the low end of our earnings per share guidance range of $5.05 to $5.30.", "Now Jim will take you through our international business.", "Jim Barber", "Thanks Kurt. I would like to take a few minutes to update you on the key components of our international strategy and the positive momentum we are experiencing. The international segment delivered our best volume growth since the third quarter 2010 up almost 8% per day. This growth combined with our network and operating efficiencies drove our industry leading margin to 14%.", "As we look at the business around the world, UPS experienced high growth in many developed economies during the first quarter. For instance, in large European markets like Germany, The UK, France and Spain exports were up more than 17%. Meanwhile large Asian markets like Hong Kong and Japan saw export growth of more than 6%. We continued to align our networks to market conditions and regional trade patterns.", "Europe has been the foundation for UPS international investment and growth. Our customers continue to value the capabilities and solutions that we provide to support the single market economy. One of the most rewarding components of our Europe growth is to see the success of our recent acquisitions. Some examples of that success are Turkey with revenue up 18%, the UK was up 11% and Poland was 15% higher. UPS operational methods and systems facilitated the successful integrations of these key acquisitions.", "Our intra-Europe air and ground networks are proving attractive to customers looking to optimize their supply chains. We recently invested $200 million in the UPS Europe air network with the expansion of our Cologne Air Hub. This increased our sort capacity by 70% coupled with state of the art securities screening and improved our air and ground network performance.", "The value of our extensive ground network in Europe was also evident. As cross border shipments were up 15% in the first quarter. Recent investments such as our Kiala acquisition and the UPS Access Point Rollout in Europe are further strengthening our ecommerce proposition escalating our ability to serve the end consumer around the world.", "UPS My Choice continued to be a great success in the U.S. As part of our global retail strategy we are evaluating expansion opportunities for this end consumer solution in markets around the world.", "In 2012 we changed how we interact with our middle market customers across our international business. We understand our needs better and are tailoring industry specific solutions that add value for them. This initiative is paying dividends as we achieved double-digit gains in four important verticals; retail, healthcare, industrial and automotive. UPS capabilities and solutions resonate well in these verticals, giving us confidence of recent trends are sustainable.", "Emerging markets are the next logical step in the UPS international expansion strategy and will contribute to growth as we enhance our capabilities in these underserved markets. We are in the early stages of the UPS emerging market strategy. The realignment of the international business units is allowing us to concentrate our efforts and leadership teams in these developing economies. As we progress we will keep you updated.", "In closing, I am proud of the dedication and hard work of UPS' around the world that produce these results. In fact I see our most important competitive advantage as the UPS culture and how it integrates with local communities in our diversified portfolio. No matter where I go, UPS people speak the language of dedication and commitment to exceeding our customer expectations.", "Thanks, now I\u2019ll turn it back to you Kurt.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks Jim and we look forward to lot of great future events in the international segment.", "Operator we\u2019ll turn it back over to you then to open up the lines.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "I trust the weather and the guidance first off here. You\u2019re maintaining that you can hit the low end of the previously stated guidance range, despite the tough first quarter. I am just curious what are the two or three main drivers that give you confidence, you mentioned some strong package growth in SurePost, but just the two or three broadly that you think will help you and may be some trends here into the second quarter that support your confidence in those. Thanks.", "Scott Davis", "Yeah Scott it has been a challenging time and our operations people in the U.S. faced clearly extraordinary conditions and really storm after storm and as you heard, over half the days we had some significant network operations with facilities shut down. So it was a very tough quarter.", "Beneath that though we do feel that the initiatives we\u2019ve rolled out in the core momentum of the company is continuing steadily. So if you peel away that exclusion basically our guidance remains unchanged. We\u2019re seeing a little better volume on the light weight side and the operations now that skies have cleared have worked a little better. So Myron may be you could talk a little bit how you guys I guess survived Q1 and the momentum coming into Q2.", "Myron Gray", "Scott and Kurt both have alluded to in their opening comments on 34 of the 63 operating days in the quarter, we experienced severe weather conditions prompting many of the governors in the States that were effected to issue a level three emergency condition that prohibited us from working.", "We also saw a tremendous uptick in the number of trailers that were impacted by weather rising over 400%. As the result of it, our direct labor hours as well as overtime expense went up significantly. Overtime hours were impacted by more than 20%, I don\u2019t think there is a person in the country who is more happy about seeing spring weather return and as a result of it in April, both our productivity and service has returned to normal level. So as Kurt has alluded to you, we don\u2019t see an issue moving forward.", "Scott Davis", "Can I just the macro-economic environment looks decent as we move forward. I think the both the global GDP and U.S. GDP will be a little better than they were last year, not robust, but better than they were a year ago. And what excites me is I think we\u2019re going to see all three segments producing good growth. We saw international, we saw supply chain and freight accomplish what they\u2019re supposed to in the first quarter, that momentum is going forward. In domestic we saw (currency) [ph] improvement in to the March and we\u2019re seeing it in April, so we feel very good about the 14% margins in domestic.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Kurt and Scott I am curious if you can talk a little bit about pricing. Scott, given the comments you just made about GDP and given the experience in the fourth quarter where we kind of ran out capacity which seemed to me we\u2019ve got maybe an increasingly positive backdrop for pushing harder on price. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about that and are we entering a period where may be pricing gets a bit better?", "Scott Davis", "Well, we do think that pricing is very stable and I\u2019ll have Alan talk about it little bit. Clearly the significant change in our mix does mask what we think is a core base rate pricing of about 2% plus or minus. And so with the substantial mix shift, it\u2019s made it hard to see but we feel pretty good that we\u2019re making investments and we\u2019ll be compensated fairly for it. So, Alan may be you could expand a little bit on pricing.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes I mean I would just add that the base rate increases of about 2% we\u2019ve been experiencing for quite some time certainly masked by customer and product mix changes that were certainly exacerbated by some of the weather trends that Kurt alluded to in the opening comments. As far as peak season goes, our goal is to ensure we are properly compensated based on our customer shipping characteristics and also their seasonal patterns. And we\u2019re certainly working with each customer and their specific contracts on an individual basis to make sure that we\u2019re compensated fairly for this services that we\u2019re providing.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. If I can just follow up on that, the pricing commentary there, may be just get a little bit more specific on that. Do you plan to use price to then adjust behavior in terms of getting it away from the December 23rd kind of peak day and kind of may be shifting the behavior a little earlier to help the network and I guess following on that, what additional projects, it sounded like you\u2019re things to accelerate shipments. It may be some more automation, can you may be dig into that a little bit in terms of where the 100 million and 500 million of investments are going?", "Scott Davis", "Ken I\u2019ll take your first question anyway and I\u2019ll let Alan expand a little bit on our real priority with customers. Our top priority this year is to provide superior service and quality operations to help our customers succeed during peak season. So we\u2019ll talk a little more in the future about the network enhancements. But Alan this is not the new, you guys work with customers and plan operation specifically peak season and use both price and strategy to manage it, right?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, so just to add a little bit of color on that. We\u2019ve met with all of our major and certainly our largest customers to increase the collaboration, very-very productive meetings that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re working on improving mutual planning capabilities with obviously the ultimate goal of enhancing their end consumers' customer experience. Working on areas with these customers splits, bypasses, direct ships, late multiple, we can pick up special operating plans and then we\u2019re obviously communication the plans that we\u2019re working on unilaterally in the areas of forecasting, capacity planning, visibility and communication.", "Scott Davis", "And Ken I'll just add there, pretty much all options are still on the table, it\u2019s early in the process. We said last quarter, we really want to be able to meet customer expectations, but also meet our financial objectives at peak. So, we\u2019re still evaluating alternatives out there.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.", "Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company", "Yes, good morning everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit about may be some of the network adjustments that you\u2019re making in terms of as you\u2019re getting more of the SurePost revenue, one of the benefits of the ground network had been getting the better density on that local delivery on the B2C type front and if more shifting over the SurePost which is probably great for the overall network in terms of the revenue streams, but like you had to do on the international side, are you having to make any network adjustments because of that falling in to SurePost and then secondarily to that and I know it\u2019s probably too early to talk specifics, but does the new contract for the Teamsters give you a better flexibility to may be handle more SurePost away from the direct ground business? Thank you.", "Scott Davis", "I\u2019ll take the Teamster question, I guess the contract question first and we\u2019ll move over to probably David. The news just broke last night on this contract being ratified. We have not yet been formally notified by the teamsters. Once we get formal notifications as Kurt said, we will do a webcast of the details of the contract, so really do want to get into the flexibilities of the cost until we get the formal notification which hopefully is coming soon.", "David Abney", "Okay, as far as the changes in the system and effects that it could have by additional SurePost, really it\u2019s the same technology that we use in the rest of our business, certainly helps us here. So SurePost redirect is about as good an example as you can have and how our technology allows us to accommodate this change.", "So very late in the process, we can determine if there are additional packages going to the same stop and then we can redirect that and then we will actually deliver it. It will be much cheaper than tendering it to the post office. If it\u2019s a single package, then we would do just the opposite, let it go ahead and flow. There is other, the technology where we can scan and make those decisions in the automation that we have placed in our hubs, we also have in our preloads. So yes, we see a change in the types of packages and the flow of the packages but we certainly have the automation and we certainly have the technology to adjust to that.", "Scott Davis", "Yes I guess may be one high level recap on that is that the goal for us is to make the investments to get our variable cost down extremely low and these packages drive very little capital and low operating expenses they flow through our automated system, so we\u2019re confident that we understand the operational changes and we\u2019re making the investments to be able to profit off of this growth for a long time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Could you give us a little bit of an update on the rollout of the ORION system and may be talk at the micro level about what types of sort of productivity impact this is having in terms of [indiscernible] an hour or any type of metric that can give us some better sense for how impactful this rollout can be going forward?", "Scott Davis", "Right, well other than the fact that we have in some of our (ORION) [ph] people out in three feet of snow trying to chart out route, so I think it\u2019s moving pretty well. Myron what do you think?", "Myron Gray", "David we\u2019re certainly encouraged by the results that we've seeing thus far and as we alluded to in the first -- in last call, we certainly added 200 resources to help us with our implementation. To-date only approximately 20% of our drivers have been implemented, we will expect that to approach nearly 45% by year\u2019s end but it\u2019s too early to give you any numbers at this point even though we\u2019re encouraged and at the November investors conference, I think we will have more information to divulge to you", "Scott Davis", "But we\u2019re very encouraged by the progress we\u2019re seeing so far and as Myron said in November we\u2019ll probably give you the metrics.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "So wanted to ask a little bit about the buyback and if there if you see some flexibility now that the teamsters\u2019 contract is about to get approved to ramp that up and may be do you feel comfortable putting some broad numbers in terms of the payment to the multi-employer plans and then as debt comes off the balance sheet, is that an important metric you look at or consider when you think about how much stock you do want to buyback?", "Scott Davis", "Okay, Scott I\u2019ll try to piece all that together into one question I guess. No, our capital distribution policy, we guided this year of repurchasing 2.7 billion in stock you can see that we\u2019re well along the way on that in the first quarter and the increased dividend, so the settlement of the contract is not a material impact on our capital policies. We remain very strong on free cash flow and we\u2019ll distribute accordingly. We\u2019ll be sharing a lot more information on the migration of the retiree healthcare liability off our balance sheet and are always looking for ways to use our low cost to capital and our quality balance sheet to minimize volatility and improve returns, so this is no different.", "Kurt Kuehn", "And that those information will be forthcoming soon. If the reports are accurate from last night we should have the information hopefully in a couple of days and share that with you. I guess the one thing I'd add Scott is, is even though obviously net income was impacted dramatically by the weather, our cash flow gain was extraordinary in the first quarter of over 1.9 billion in free cash flow. So, we\u2019ll obviously consider that in our decisions going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "Good morning everyone. Kurt or Jim, I want to talk little bit about international margins, because I know there is a lot of moving pieces this year and you did have a good outcome in the first quarter year on year, but the comps get a little bit more difficult in the second and fourth quarter. So what are some of your assumptions around margin improvement for the remainder of the year, are you assuming sequential demand improvement and yield improvement, can you talk a little bit more about that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, we have guided to profits growing 12% to 14% this year, clearly they\u2019re off to a good start, so I think you\u2019ll continue to see improvements and hopefully you got to sense that we do think that things are moving well. So, Jim may be you could expand a little on some of your guys' results and outlook.", "Jim Barber", "Yes so Brandon obviously the comments in the opening gave some framework to it. I think that we should keep in mind that international, we keep talking about momentum. This is really the fifth quarter in a row, it\u2019s come up. I think we have to also keep in mind it\u2019s been a year since the (TNT) [ph] situation ended, I must put that way. And the business itself has really kind of gotten back to the basics of what we\u2019re supposed to do, you can see that. And so the leadership teams are in good place right now and I think the other comment I would tell you is, we\u2019ve also looked at the international business and not only investing today what you\u2019re seeing today but in some of the guidance, some of the emerging market investment, the teams are restructuring this coming forward. So we\u2019re actually I think in a very good place internationally and all the confidence in the world to the guidance we've given you so far.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citi", "Just following up on the international question, when you think about sort of this re-acceleration of volumes that we\u2019re seeing particularly in Europe. Does it bring to the table any more opportunity to start thinking a bit more about price, it seems like sort of the underlying base rates are still pretty good, just getting a rough sense though of how maybe there could be some leverage there. This is more going to be a sort of volume opportunity as you look forward over the course of the next couple of quarters.", "Scott Davis", "Yes, well not all volumes are created equally and I think that Jim maybe you can expand a little bit on our focus there.", "Jim Barber", "Yes, a couple of things that are also going on, I think that to recognize certainly in Europe, the supply chains are moving too, they don\u2019t remain static. So some of the big supply chains around the world the customers are trying to optimize their networks, we work with them to do that, so the zones move, the distribution patterns move, so our trans-border growth in Europe, a lot of that was to support moving distribution patterns that shorten up zone, that affects the yield of the package, but our job is to create the margins in the new networks. So we\u2019re very comfortable with that.", "I also made an opening comment that I think is important which is our middle market acceleration we\u2019ve seen in last couple of quarters and we really haven\u2019t seen this in the past as our middle market is now outpacing some of our larger gold enterprise accounts. And then the other thing that\u2019s going on I think of material nature is the high-tech industry and those product launches have kind of laid down. So in the middle of all that, some of internal optimization investments seem to be paying dividends and what they\u2019ll move forward and we\u2019ll leverage all that together.", "Scott Davis", "What encouraging Jim in that quarter too is while we still saw the slower products grow at double-digit pace, we still saw express grow at 4% to 5% pace internationally which is a good sign to see express markets still growing.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ms. Allison Landry if Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison Landry - Credit Suisse", "I wanted to ask about growth in Europe and specifically the strength that you\u2019ve seen in the Pan European business. Can you give us a sense of the contribution of this segment to international profit margins and returns on invested capital? And do you think Europe as a whole will be able to achieve margins that are similar to the U.S. at some point?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, as you know, we don\u2019t breakdown margins specifically by area of the world. But clearly the international business has been a great business for us and Europe is our flagship over half of our revenues are European based. So we want to get into more detail, but we do think Europe\u2019s here to stay and that the business model Jim, that you\u2019re managing is in pretty good shape.", "Jim Barber", "Yes, I think the underpinning as Kurt said I think margins by product will keep away from. I think it\u2019s more about the network and its capability to react to the market, the single market that\u2019s there today and we\u2019ve been building that effectively from my perspective since about \u201896. And it\u2019s in great shape and we continue invest in it and we\u2019re very happy with the returns on capital and we\u2019ll keep investing where that makes sense for us and for our customers.", "Kurt Kuehn", "That\u2019s absolutely right. I think the European networks are built a lot like the U.S. network and we\u2019re getting excellent returns on invested capital in that network.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Mr. Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Just kind of dive in and maybe taking a different look at international. You talked about the strength we saw in the first quarter. I think, it sounds like April\u2019s off to a good start. I think you also said there is an improvement in your (forwarding) [ph] business on a net revenue basis. And you could about a little bit what\u2019s going on there? Is that just kind of strength you\u2019re seeing in the overall international economy? Or maybe you\u2019re getting some market share gains there as well?", "Scott Davis", "So as the opening comments alluded too, yes we are. Tonnage is up, we know that, the yield is really kind of still pressured. And when I say that, what I mean is, a few quarters ago I talked about concentration in hi-tech in military and making sure that we try to diversify through that. The team is doing good job with respect to that in some lanes the markets still are tough to actually get the buy sell jokes right. We\u2019re very, very happy with the ocean product, with the brokerage product, with a North American air freight products. So we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re very focused on and have some projects in the pipeline right now that kind of get up that air freight so we continue the momentum there. So we feel like we\u2019re hitting on three of the four cylinders with the fourth one being worked on in a pretty good way right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "So, I think Scott had said that the international outlook was more or less unchanged, the total volume growth in the quarter up 8% above I think the target that you had provided for the beginning -- for the full year 4% to 6%. I am wondering if we should expect that rate of growth to decelerate through the year to converge towards that target. And then I am also, in conjunction with that, can you provide any context to how you see the growth between non-premium and premium products trending through the year as well? Thanks.", "Scott Davis", "Yes great couple of pieces there, but I think we did show very strong growth in the first quarter, but surprised us to positive just a little bit. There is a little bit of a benefit of the Easter timing I think in the first quarter. Easter was right at the break between Q1 and Q2 last year so there may be a little extra beef in Q1 that would put a little drag on Q2. As far as the trends on premium versus standard, I\u2019ll let Jim talk to that little bit.", "Jim Barber", "Yes I think again I think as I mentioned a minute ago, four-five quarters of growth and I would combine that with the acquisition comment I made in the opening in the UK\u2019s and the Poland\u2019s and the Turkey markets for example. A lot of this is from good solid growth in the domestic product now four-five quarters in a row so you start to get lapping yourself quite frankly from that perspective. Therefore the end of the year looks a little bit different than the first, but we keep talking about that in a momentum basis. So, what that kind of outlook that you see on paper is certainly, we want to focus on the export and then combining that with the domestics in the markets where we currently are will in the future have the great capabilities.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs", "I had a couple questions just related to the Europe part, one was just, can you parse out the organic growth related to Europe, if you were able to parse out the harvesting of the recent investments.", "And then I guess just one of the other sort of comments or questions is, wondering if you could elaborate on the mix shift change that\u2019s happened in Europe where your non-premium is growing more than premium and should we be thinking about that mix shift change similar to the way that we\u2019ve been seeing it sort of evolve over in Asia where you\u2019ve had increase in deferred impacting the overall mix and pricing? Thanks.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes let me piece the parts of that so I can combine for you here. First off the issue of the organic is everything is organic right now. The acquisitions were several years ago, so there is no material acquisitions above all, really the only notable acquisition is in the healthcare space and that did not impact the results at all. The whole issue of managing the mix changes, it makes a big difference if it\u2019s -- that you\u2019re seeing trade down against the same asset. That\u2019s been the challenge in Asia where you\u2019ve gone from express to slower modes and if you don\u2019t adapt, then you\u2019re stuck with lower revenue on a fixed asset.", "But the whole nature of the UPS network is to allow customers to move up and down and I\u2019ll tell you there is a huge difference in capital employed between a package moving from Asia to Europe in a 747 versus a package moving across Europe in our integrated ground network. So the capital required and the returns are substantially different and so we\u2019re very happy to see robust growth through our integrated network.", "And then to Jim\u2019s point, as we grow the domestic business, what that does is it lowers the pickup and delivery cost for all products. So that\u2019s the benefit of the portfolio that these products reinforce themselves and we get both economy of scale as we get bigger in each country and economy of scope as we have complementary product. So as Scott said, Europe is very much following the lessons we\u2019ve learned from the U.S. capital returns and investment and we\u2019re happy to get standard volume there or premium.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kurt a quick housekeeping item can you give us a sense if the new Teamster contract is incorporated into the current guidance because it\u2019s not yet finalized and then Jim two quick follow ups with regard to the European network. With the stronger than expected growth that we\u2019ve been seeing to-date, are there any sort of necessary incremental capital investments within the ground network and can you talk a little bit about the density within your line haul network in Europe and how that compares to U.S. currently? Thanks.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Okay Teamster I\u2019ll break ranks and answer two questions because the answer to the first one is one word, and that is yes in our guidance. Jim may be you could talk about the capital expansion for Europe and whether it\u2019s material.", "Jim Barber", "Yes so I would say that certainly in the network today, part of the ongoing process and numbers we give you every year the capital is in there, but I would also say yes to the question is we have to keep investing in that network. We talked about Cologne today but our big hubs in Germany and the UK, we\u2019re investing in Turkey hubs as we speak, so yes there is continued capital requirements, but again that\u2019s all baked into the overall network and bringing the customers in that they choose the network. So we\u2019re very, very comfortable with that.", "As far as density and line haul network question, the really different networks to be honest with you, the way we run the networks European wise versus U.S. is the different and the mix of the carriers and how we actually take those products across the single market in the UPS or Partnership or contractors is different, so you really can\u2019t compare the two networks from my perspective, but again I think the networks in Europe are performing across the business beautifully and they\u2019ll continue to do so.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes I guess one comment on Europe that clearly we cycled through this as the one year anniversary of us bidding good bye to the attempt to purchase TNT. During the period of negotiation and work with TNT, we clearly put some projects on hold, both strategic projects and opportunities and also capital expansion until we were sure how we\u2019d optimize new assets. So, we certainly are in a period right now of to some extent facing the next five years with an aggressive organic approach. And we are thrilled to make investments to grow our integrated ground network in Europe.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Keith Shoemaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Keith Shoemaker - Morningstar", "Yes, a quick follow up on the capital investment. Given the growth in Europe and the mixed realized, do you anticipate making adjustments to the air fleet or is this what you needed for now?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No the air fleet is in great shape, as we said, David in the airline finished purchasing 767s last year and David, I think at least as far as the foreseeable future, we don\u2019t expect any major capital additions.", "David Abney", "No we don\u2019t have any plans to buy any aircraft in the next few years. We have of course been able to increase our load factor and the biggest focus is just on improving the quality of the revenue that\u2019s in our aircraft and with the fact that our expedited volume has grown, has given us a lot of flexibilities on how do we actually put that our aircraft, do we do something else with it or do we hold it for a day to more fully utilize the aircraft. So it\u2019s giving us lot of flexibility.", "Jim Barber", "And this is Jim, I would add one comment to it parallel to the opening comments is the network in Europe as an intra-European fleet is in great shape as everybody is saying. The real -- the fun part of this right now given where we are is through the emerging markets is to adapt and connect it globally across world in a different way and the teams are working on that and as we go forward that would probably be likely where the adaptations come to the network to connect to the European network versus changing the core of it.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets", "Just trying to keep track of the kind of investment that you were talking about in terms of being prepared for peak season and understanding that when you look at not in the next 10 years have been normal days in Thanksgiving and Christmas not the compressed period. Just trying to get a sense of what percentage of the investment is being made with capital dollars to address network, maybe deficiencies on a long-term basis versus what percentage may be, you're going to address using operating dollars, might be for temporary employees or something like that. How are you trying to balance that investment?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I\u2019ll start off and then David can fill you may be on the status of it. We\u2019ve really quoted a couple of numbers; one that we\u2019re expanding our capital investments in general broadly to expand capacity in the U.S. and automate facilities. Those are long-term investments that stand regardless of the peak issue. The other is we are doing some things on the technology side, on the customer alignment side and on the flexible capacity side and that\u2019s really driving that 100 million expense headwind this year, that\u2019s more of a one-time issue. And Dave maybe you could expand a little.", "David Abney", "Certainly well, our peak planning committee has been focusing all this year made solid progress. And when it comes to capacity we are taking two approaches. The permanent capacity will help us throughout the years and Kurt referred to that a little bit but the North Bay Automation retrofit project is an example of that. We\u2019re also increasing the capacity of CACH, our Chicago Consolidated Hub and we\u2019re also adding some trailer capability in Worldport, both from an unload and a load standpoint.", "But then the other thing we\u2019re doing is temporary what we call mobile capacity, that we can move from peak to peak, from building to building. And it\u2019s adding, we\u2019re going to add nearly 10% car positions this year, it\u2019s over 6,000 car positions. And in general we call mobile distribution units and these will be addressing specific temporary needs. But if those needs change next year, we'll just simply move that capability from year-to-year.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus", "Real quickly on the ground side, U.S. domestic ground volumes ex-SmartPost, what do they grow year-over-year in the first quarter and how are they trending in April?", "Scott Davis", "They were up moderately and I think trends in April as we said once now that the weather has cleared continue very steadily, it\u2019s why we feel pretty good on the U.S. economic outlook.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital", "I just wanted to follow up on the mix conversation. Should we think about these mix trends as secular trends that will accelerate or do we expect some kind of normalization if only from easier comps. And just wondering if you can give us a sense of what yields might look like after you incorporate your base rate increases and then what\u2019s going on the mix side of things?", "Scott Davis", "Yes, there is a couple of big dimensions and I\u2019ll let Alan talk a little bit about it. That some of them are cyclical and some of them are long-term trends, certainly the continuing growth of B2C both in the U.S. and globally is something that\u2019s here to stay. But things like weight increasing or decreasing or near shoring versus far shoring are things that come and go a bit.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, let me add a point before Alan gets in. It\u2019s only the first quarter exaggerated though with the weather. And we hit commercial manufacturing harder than it hit obviously ecommerce, so what you saw in the first quarter was exaggerated.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "I think certainly the -- we\u2019re going to continue to see strong residential growth and I think you\u2019ll see it across all of our residential products whether its air, ground or SurePost as retailers are out there offering wide variety of services to their customers to meet the varying needs. Certainly these last few quarters, we\u2019ve seen our commercial growth turned positive on the ground which is a good sign also. And I think that while there's certainly been a significant amount of down-trading in the marketplace, we believe that the express market will come back as the economy gets better and global trade increases.", "Scott Davis", "And we\u2019re not uncomfortable with these trends. We still think for the last nine months of this year will generate 14% margins in the U.S. We did that really in 2012 in the first three quarters of 2013. So with our technologies, our network we could still generate good margins on B2C.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital", "Is there any way you think about once you incorporate mix, so what yield may look like?", "Scott Davis", "That\u2019s a bit speculative for right now and we\u2019ll move onto next question.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens Inc.", "Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. So I guess focusing on the international airfreight side of things for a moment, trends thus far in 2014 seem to indicate they were seeing some modest sustained improvement there for the first time in a couple of years. So I guess could you comment on what do you think is really driving that. Is it a better global economic picture? Do you think maybe it\u2019s inventory restocking or is this something else and do you feel like these trends are sustainable for 2014 and may be beyond?", "Jim Barber", "I would say was all of what you just mentioned plus one and that is that, that our customers don\u2019t stay static with their supply chains and they move them and they\u2019re trying to optimize their supply chains and they\u2019re moving from small package at times to airfreight and airfreight to ocean and ocean to a domestic on another continent. So our job is to be ready for that and be one step or right in lock step with them, so that is -- and I think the other thing that you should keep in mind is that, that\u2019s kind of the power of the UPS offering is we don\u2019t run a pure freight network, it\u2019s a hybrid and we\u2019ve got a lot of options depending on how the customers choose to come to us. So there is a lot of factors going on and we just got to make sure we\u2019re supportive of really the needs and the request of our customers.", "Scott Davis", "And I guess one of the nice things is, we did see and are seeing some rebound in exports out of Asia on the freight side, but Alan we\u2019re also seeing quite a of strength south of the border, right?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, so on the U.S. Mexico lane there, we\u2019ve launched on the package side a standard ground service to and from Mexico which on a small base right now is experiencing very, very significant growth on a percentage basis, so we\u2019re really excited about that. We\u2019ve got our cross border connect product on the freight side, that\u2019s also experiencing good growth. And I would just add to Jim\u2019s comment that, the portfolio that we\u2019re positioning with our customers is also I think allowing us to penetrate the airfreight market in a bigger way and I think you\u2019re going to see some broader gains in that area for us. And the other last thing I would just say is worldwide express freight we haven\u2019t talked about today, that\u2019s been launched I guess a little bit over a year ago now in a big way and we\u2019re experiencing very, very high growth in that area again on a small base right now, but very well resonating with our customers.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Ms. Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Co.", "Thanks very much operator. Thanks for the time. You might have talked about this and I just missed it, but can you just talk about why the tax rate went up so much in the first quarter on a year on year basis?", "Scott Davis", "Yes, Helane we did guide this year that we would be seeing an increase in the tax rate. We retched it up in the middle of last year from the (34 or 35) [ph] that we had in January of last year first quarter and it is now at 36. So we have seen an increase and this is the last quarter at which we\u2019ll have this big of a gap, but it clearly was an increase that just has to do with the mix of profits around the world, our forwarding unit that struggled last year and some of those things impacted our marginal rate. So certainly there is no company more eager to see U.S. tax reform and some rebalancing of rates around the globe than us and we continue to make that a priority and are working with Washington to ensure that U.S. remains competitive.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Helane we did build the guidance in a 36%, so that was expected.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Co.", "Right, well I figured you did that but I was just kind of wondering is 30.4% last year going into 6 I think this year, so, okay.", "Kurt Kuehn", "The 30.4, I\u2019m sorry Helane, that was distorted because of the nature of the TNT settlement, some of the payments were taxable some weren't, but the core rate for last year on the adjusted is 34.5.", "Operator", "Due to time constraints our last question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research", "Thank you, and thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to touch base, the cash on the balance sheet's back over 7 billion. I know you mentioned it will cost you some money to exit these remaining pension liabilities. But could you talk a little bit about how much cash you think you need on the balance sheet, because this is almost double what it was at the bottom of the recession here, and just kind of longer-term thoughts on capital deployment.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, and as Scott said, we had just a huge free cash flow quarter, in Q1 capital expenditures were little low, clearly it\u2019s hard to build buildings in the blizzards. So we\u2019ll ramp some of that up and use some of that cash for capital improvements Jeff, but we do expect to continue strong distributions, the company has no agenda to hoard cash. At the same time we like to have a strong balance sheet. So we\u2019re going to continue with our basic targets of distributing near 100% of net income in the form of dividends and share repurchases and keep a little powder dry for M&A and other strategic initiatives.", "Scott Davis", "In Q1 Kurt, I think we distributed 140% net income, so Jeff it will be balance. We\u2019ll continue the strong distributions, we\u2019ll continue to reinvest in the business.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Wilkinson. Please go ahead sir.", "Scott Davis", "Well let me just -- this is Scott, I\u2019ll do a quick recap. It was clearly the first quarter was a challenge, but again as we talked about the rest of 2014 looks quite promising. The economy though is still not robust, it\u2019ll be better than what we saw last year, both here in the U.S. and globally. What I am excited about is the UPS we\u2019re going to be hitting it on all cylinders as all three segments for business will show nice improvements in operating profit over the last nine months of this year. And frankly we\u2019ve not seen all three segments improve at the same time since 2010. So look for good things ahead from UPS and thanks for being on the call today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude our conference call for today.

These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "As previously announced during the quarter, UPS completed the transfer of post-retirement liabilities for certain Teamster employees to defined contribution healthcare plans. As a result, the company recorded an after-tax charge of $665 million reducing earnings per share by $0.72. In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS\u2019 free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure.", "The webcast of today\u2019s call along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Just as a reminder, as on previous calls, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.", "Thanks for your cooperation. Now, I will turn it over to Scott.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Joe, and good morning to everyone. UPS experienced robust second quarter revenue and volume growth across the portfolio, and we are encouraged to have all three segments improving operating profit, the first time since 2011. Customers choose UPS solutions at an increasing pace confirming the value of our portfolio.", "However, our results also reflect the challenge of today\u2019s evolving marketplace and earnings were somewhat less than we expected. The accelerated growth and peak season preparations are driving the implementation costs as well as increased investments in automation and new capacity. David will provide you details on these efforts in a moment.", "The initiatives we are pursuing today will enable UPS to provide enhanced solutions for our customers to secure their business and build their trust. At the same time, we\u2019d look for opportunities to improve revenue management, driving more bottom line growth and industry-leading margins well into the future. The expansion of dim weight pricing is a change we\u2019re making to ensure UPS is properly compensated for network consumption.", "During the quarter, we saw economies around the world pick up a bit. The U.S. economy did rebound as expected from the weather-related problems in the first quarter. Solid economic fundamentals had driven retail sales higher especially e-commerce. In Europe, the economic outlook has remained steady with growth from larger countries offsetting slower, smaller ones. While growth in Asia remains relatively stable, they are seeing an acceleration of overall exports.", "One way to increase economic growth is through pre-trade. Recent efforts by the administration to proceed with a next phase of the National Export Initiative will develop opportunities for U.S. small and medium-sized customers to reach new markets. This platform includes sections on trade facilitation, border clearance reform, free trade agreements and infrastructure investment. Expanding pre-trade agreements will provide employment opportunities here at home.", "Speaking of employment opportunities, to support the Joining Forces initiative, we pledged to hire 50,000 veterans by 2018. Military veterans have a long tradition at UPS and bring valuable skills that provide great benefits for our company. Also during the quarter, because of our progress with ORION, CIO Magazine recognized UPS as one of 100 companies that demonstrates excellence and achievement in information technology.", "This breakthrough routing technology represents a decade-long effort to develop tools that reduce miles driven, cut fuel consumption and improve the customer experience. Recognition like this is rewarding but more importantly the capabilities we received from this technology puts UPS in a better position to respond to changing market dynamics.", "Before I turn it over to David, I want to take a moment to congratulate him on being named UPS\u2019 eleventh CEO. I know he\u2019s excited to lead UPS and I\u2019m confident David will bring his extraordinary passion and commitment to the job. David?", "David Abney", "Thanks, Scott. I speak for everyone at UPS when I say that we are a better company as a result of inspired leadership you\u2019ve provided. You led the company through one of the more turbulent global economic periods in history transforming UPS into the world\u2019s leading logistics provider. On behalf of the 400,000 UPS\u2019 around the world, we say thank you.", "On a more personal note, Scott and I have worked closely for more than a decade. During that time he has been an inspiring mentor and I look forward to working with him as Chairman. As part of the transition, Scott will remain in his current role until September. This allows me to spend most of my time out with customers and employees to better understand their needs and listen to their ideas. From what I have heard so far, I am more encouraged than ever about the future of UPS.", "One frequent topic of discussion has been our preparation for peak season. We\u2019ve had meaningful conversations with customers about our plans. These discussions provide the foundation for a joint commitment of forecast volume enabling UPS to better manage how large accounts impact our network. We have made changes to UPS technology that will improve communication with customers. Solutions have been implemented to provide better information on package location and shipment status, ultimately benefitting customers and UPS.", "The accelerated ORION deployment is progressing. Now, its reductions have come in higher than planned and we expect to have about 45% of our drivers using the routing technology for peak. The facility automation and expansion projects are moving ahead as expected. Several new buildings and retrofit projects in California and Texas will come on line later this year, providing additional capacity and flexibility.", "To increase sort capacity, we are opening about 50 new hub source in existing buildings. This will add 5% to our capacity with minimal capital investment. UPS is focused on staying ahead of the holiday shipment surge that starts during cyber week. We have always had limited operations on Black Friday. However, this year we will expand to a full operating day. While this benefits the network by leveling volume fluctuations, it will drive additional operating costs.", "As we look more closely at preparing for peak and the implications of the accelerated volume growth, we have expanded the scope of several projects I just reviewed. Though these projects will weigh on 2014 earnings, they will pay for themselves in the long run. Overall, we are ahead of our peak readiness plan and I am confident UPS would deliver a great peak season this year.", "Now, looking across the portfolio, I will provide some details on other strategic investments UPS is making. Here in the U.S. we opened our new automated facility in Laredo, Texas. This is a key location to support the rapid growth along the U.S. and Mexican border. Also in the U.S., we recently opened 36 healthcare-compliant field stocking locations to reduce delivery time for medical device shipments. These sites will provide customers the ability to reach over 80% of U.S. hospital beds within four hours.", "In Europe, UPS announced the opening of a new packaged center in Southampton, UK. This 150-car facility nearly doubles the capacity of two other buildings it replaces. Meanwhile in Asia, we opened a distribution facility at the Beijing airport to serve UPS customers hi-tech retail and healthcare supply chain needs. Also in Asia, we added our rail service option for UPS forwarding customers shipping from China to Europe. This low-cost, four-container offering is up to 50% faster than ocean freight and 70% less costly than airfreight.", "In Latin-America, we announced a significant expansion of our small package operations in Brazil. The opening of nine facilities will allow UPS to service more than 200 cities in the country. As you can see, UPS has been busy expanding our reach, creating supply chain capabilities and building out our small package infrastructure. These investments are part of our long-term strategy for growth and will improve returns going forward. This will be a parent in 2015 as we benefit from dim weight pricing and operational improvements from ORION.", "UPS\u2019 around the world are implementing these innovated solutions to meet customer needs. UPS is positioned to benefit from the continuing acceleration of global trade and the economic growth of emerging markets. I can assure you creating value for customers and shareowners remains a top priority for the senior leadership team at UPS. I look forward to meeting many of you at the investor conference in November where we will share more details on our plans for the future.", "Now, I would turn it over to Kurt to update you on the quarter\u2019s results. Kurt?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, David, and good morning. UPS portfolio is hitting the mark with customers resulting in global shipment growth of 7.2% and driving revenue up 5.6% to a total $14.3 billion. Certainly the pace of growth exceeded our expectations. However, increased demand for low cost deferred solutions has put pressure on yields and margins.", "Second quarter earnings per share increased by 7.1% but was below our expectations. We continued investing in new capabilities and expanding our network, adapting our business today to ensure that we can capitalize on future growth opportunities.", "Now for some details on how the segments performed. Starting with U.S. domestic where revenue increased 5.2% to $8.7 billion, driven by a 7% jump in packaged volume. UPS Ground products contributed 8% growth while deferred improved over 5%. Retailers continue to select UPS SurePost for their lightweight residential shipments, accounting for about half of our volume growth this quarter. However, we do expect this growth to slow a bit as we wrap wins from last year.", "In addition, during the quarter, a retail customer upgraded its catalog distribution to UPS Ground from the U.S. mail contributing to our ground growth. Beyond B2C, our B2B growth was the highest we\u2019ve seen in several years, primarily due to the retail sector. We also saw improvements in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. Combined, these changes in product and customer mix led yields lower by 2% driven primarily by a more than 60% jump in UPS SurePost shipments.", "Operating profits increased by 34 million to $1.2 billion while operating margin decline slightly to 13.5%. A couple of key factors created operating expense headwinds. First, we continued to experience very poor rail performance during the quarter. In order to maintain service commitments, alternative operating plans were put into place. This drove higher purchase transportation expense as well as excess UPS network costs.", "In addition, hiring and training costs increased in Q2 due to the accelerated volume growth and the peak-related projects that David mentioned. However, we were able to offset much of the higher costs through improved productivity. Our direct labor hours were up 6% and miles driven were up 4% compared to average daily volume growth of 7.4%. Expense per package declined by 1.7%, a good result but not quite enough to offset the yield decline.", "Now for the international business where revenue was $3.3 billion, up 6%. Total shipments increased by 6.6% led by higher export product growth for Europe and Asia. Export shipments jumped 9.1% with Europe up 13% and Asia up about 6%. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased by 5% led by strong growth in Europe. Currently neutral revenue per piece declined 1.7% as our export product yields dropped by 4%.", "Strong non-premium growth of 13% continued to outpace premium products although they were also up by 4%. Yield was also lowered by shorter trade lanes as our intra-Europe volume was one of the fastest growing lanes. Operating profit improved by 4.4% to $471 million. However, operating margin did contract 20 basis points to 14.5%.", "During the quarter, we continued to experience rapid shipment growth as changing volume distribution patterns developed in Europe. These trends pushed network capacity above ideal levels in a few areas and as a result we were forced to pay a premium for short-term capacity. This contributed to higher delivery and network expenses, ultimately driving in-country costs up by 8.9%.", "In the near term, our team in Europe is implementing a number of changes to operations while pursuing revenue management initiatives aimed at improving yields. In addition, we are finalizing our capital investment plan designed to add capacity and improve operating leverage. We are confident in our ability to pull growth through the bottom line.", "Looking now at supply chain and freight which performed well this quarter with revenue growth of 6.5% up to 2.3 billion. Operating profit increased 11% and margin expanded by 30 basis points to 7.5%. The forwarding unit experienced substantial revenue growth and expanded operating margin slightly, driven by improvements in ocean forwarding and brokerage.", "International airfreight experienced double-digit growth in both shipments and tonnage although the pricing environment out of Asia continued to weigh on profitability. In distribution, customers continue to seek our unique solutions to their supply chain needs. Revenue increased by high single digits lifted by improved demand from retail and healthcare clients.", "UPS freight revenue grew 5.5% primarily due to a 4% improvement in LTL revenue per 100 weight. Pricing benefitted from the acceleration of the rate increase and tightening market capacity. The unit improved both operating profit and margins.", "Now for an update on our cash position. For the six months ended June 30, UPS generated 1.0 billion in free cash flow. This number was impacted by the transfer of union post-retirement liabilities that we discussed last quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, cash flow improved by over 400 million over last year.", "So far this year, UPS has paid 1.2 billion in dividends, up more than 8% per share. We\u2019ve also repurchased 13.7 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Looking at our expectations for the rest of the year, UPS growth around the world has picked up and we are investing in capacity and automation today and will provide excellent returns down the road.", "The peak preparation efforts that David mentioned like the additional sorts, facility enhancement projects and the expansion of our Black Friday operations will drive costs higher. During the ramp up and implementation, these projects are expected to increase 2014 operating expense by a total of $175 million. This represents another 75 million on top of our original estimates. As a result, we now expect earnings per share to be in a range of $4.90 to $5 a share, representing a 7% to 9% increase over 2013.", "We do anticipate a strong second half of 2014 with earnings per share growth of 12% to 17% over the back half of 2013 with all three segments increasing operating profits. In the U.S. treating Black Friday as a full operating day this year will lower reported daily volume growth in Q4 by about 160 basis points. Nonetheless, we expect average daily packaged growth to be a little over 5%, slightly higher than previously guided. Revenue per package is projected to decline by about 1%.", "Operating margin is expected to expand to approximately 14%. We also expect to see strong second half improvements in our international results with shipment growth between 4% and 6%. Yields will continue to be challenged by the changing product mix. Operating profit is estimated to grow at low double digit rates with some margin expansion. Our expectations for supply chain and freight remain positive with mid single digit revenue improvements and mid teens operating profit growth.", "So as you can see, we are experiencing some growing pains right now. This is a great problem to have as long as we successfully adapt our network and facilities to effectively bring this growth through to the bottom line.", "This completes our prepared remarks and we\u2019re ready to take your questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you. Good morning. Scott, congratulations on a successful tenure. Wish you the best in the future.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Kevin, appreciate it.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "My question, guys, you continue to talk about the growth in non-premium products continue to outpace premium products. Are we seeing that delta shrink at all as volumes improve across the board, whether it\u2019s international or domestic? And maybe we\u2019re starting to see some customers possibly move back to premium products given a strengthening economy?", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, clearly there\u2019s some view of that but in the international, for example, we saw a solid 4% growth in those premium products. It\u2019s just dwarfed by the transport or growth in shipments. I think generally we\u2019re seeing life in all parts of the portfolio although we expect a continued spread where the deferred products and standard products will continue to grow in excess with premium ones, Kevin.", "David Abney", "It does seem that it has plateaued. I mean over the last couple of quarters we\u2019re not seeing that gap get any bigger, so it feels like or as long as we can see that growth. And if you see some new technology introductions later this year that might help the express also.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Got you. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m a bit curious about the U.S. on your rail disruption and then if I can kind of throw in a second part and go international and just curious about the China-Europe rail capacity and how much that can ramp to? Thanks.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, I think certainly the rail disruption and the congestion this quarter was significant driving both added expense and creating some real challenges on the service side. I don\u2019t know, Myron, maybe you could talk just a little bit about what we\u2019re doing then.", "Myron Gray", "Yes, Scott, along with disruptions caused by the rail network what that does is certainly increase the purchase transportation costs in the quarter. And as a result of that, we also has saw a significant increase in hiring and training needs to offset the abilities of the rails to adhere to our expectations on our customers to meet on time commitments. So we\u2019re in a process of adding additional feeder drivers to offset that costs.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes. So clearly we\u2019re adapting and adjusting as it was happening and created some challenges, but we have transitioned some of the volume off in the most congested lanes. As far as the Asia to Europe lane, that\u2019s still a relatively small amount right now but we think over the long term it will be an opportunity although certainly some of the disruptions as you cross borders there may be a challenge for a while.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "All right. Congratulations Scott and David.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thank you.", "David Abney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. If we can talk about your new guidance, the $4.90 to $5, it seems that it\u2019s much larger than the $175 million expense, maybe even over $200 million to $400 million in terms of the decrease. Is there anything going on other than just your increased expenses? And maybe can you talk in the same vein about margins on the e-commerce? Is that changing the dynamics of the margin capability in ground at all or can you maybe just delve into what the margin potential on e-commerce volumes are? Thanks.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, I think, Ken, certainly a portion of the guidance change is the Q2 results. And I think if you factor that out then really what we\u2019re looking forward comes very close to the overall investments and added expense that we\u2019ve made. So, clearly, the challenges of us keeping up and training quickly as part of this ramp up does create some headwinds. But the Q2 contributor to better the adjustment we had some excess cost with the rails and then if you look forward, the primary difference and what we\u2019ve been discussing is just the current investment. So we are looking for a 12% to 17% increase in the back half of the year and I think all of those pieces of the puzzle fit together.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Ken, we really after the weather in the first quarter \u2013 our last quarter we guided to the bottom of the range which was really 5.05, so I think that\u2019s your starting point.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Kurt, could you maybe talk a little bit about the added 175 million, how much of that you guys have already spent? How much remains to be spent? And then David, if you could talk a little bit about sort of how you look at those costs next year and what kind of actions you can take to make sure that those actually come out of the P&L next year?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. So if you\u2019ll look at the change in our description of the investments as we\u2019ve really dug in and made better forecast, the big amount of the change is going to occur primarily in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re adding operations the day after Thanksgiving that does add expense. Over time it may generate more revenue but the real purpose is to smooth out operations. And then also our IT resources and we\u2019re going to open almost 50 new hub sorts to handle capacity. So the majority of the change in the added expense is in the fourth quarter. We spent about 15% of the total in the second quarter. That will get up to 30% or so in the third quarter and then the residual kick-in in the fourth quarter. David, maybe you can talk a little bit about how this fits together.", "David Abney", "Certainly can. First, I think the point is that many of the projects and investments that we\u2019re making in this year will provide benefits not only this peak but throughout next year. A good example is the additional IT expense that we\u2019re experiencing. We\u2019re working on 30 different projects and those projects will help us for peak but they also will help us next year and we won\u2019t have that additional expense. So that\u2019s one good example. The second one is running a full operations day on Black Friday. That is an additional expense but what we have to realize is it smoothes out the cyber week volume, allows us to better manage e-commerce demand and some of that costs will be offset by more efficient operations for the following week. And while we haven\u2019t determined exactly what we would do next year for Black Friday, we do expect that we would operate on a pretty extensive basis. And then the wrap up costs for these 50 additional hubs, a lot of the expense is just getting those hubs ready and then getting them staffed. Many of those hubs or some of them will continue to run through next year. Others, it will be much easier to wrap them up next year for peak just because we\u2019ve done all the work this year. So I\u2019d say a considerable amount of the costs would not be in next year\u2019s numbers.", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, just to add to that, David, I think as we look at next year we expect OpEx not to be nearly as dramatic for this purpose as we saw in 2014. If something drives that then we\u2019ll have to evaluate pricing at peak season again. If we have to do this again, we\u2019ll have to evaluate how we price at peak season.", "David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein", "All right. Thanks very much for the time.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Mr. Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead, sir.", "Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company", "Good morning, everyone. And want to echo my congratulations, Scott and David.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thank you, Nate.", "David Abney", "Thanks, Nate.", "Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company", "So kind of going on along with that question, but a little bit bigger picture in terms of \u2013 like from a strategic focus, we've kind of been through the decrease from premium to non-premium products and the lower volumes out of Asia and whatnot and then we had the peak season issue where you\u2019re clearly adjusting for; and then we had the rail issues early this year. It seems like, give or take, the overall freight environment and supply chains are so dramatically changing quarter-to-quarter. How do you maintain that flexibility longer term as we get through these different volume swings and different movements in terms of how do you think about the business and how do you have to react to that?", "D. Scott Davis", "Well, Nate, I think what you\u2019ve seen is us reacting strongly over the last few years. One of the things we are doing to make us more capable to adjust to these changing conditions is reinvesting in the network heavily and focused on IT with data-driven operations, increased automation and a lot of creative applications from the market side. So this has been a part of the transformation that we\u2019ve been talking about for several years now. Right now certainly preparing the network and lowering our variable cost to handle this continued growth in B2C is the midst to the investments we\u2019re making. So, we think we\u2019re on top of this. I mean it doesn\u2019t always come out as smooth as you\u2019d like and clearly we would have liked to have a little stronger quarter. But the demand is there. I think UPS quality and service is great and so we feel very good that we\u2019re building this company for the long term no matter how the market changes.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to focus on the international business. I believe you said Europe is about 50% of that. So just wondering how much of your growth expectations internationally are macro-related versus what you\u2019re doing to some internal initiatives, network adjustments, acquisitions, things like that? Trying to get a sense of how the macro environment in Europe might impact the international business.", "D. Scott Davis", "Clearly the UPS growth is far outpacing any definition of either market or GDP growth in Europe which remains, I guess we would say steady but sluggish. But Jim, maybe you could talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on over there.", "Jim Barber", "Sure. I would say back to those points is that in this quarter obviously with revenues up at 6 and exports in double digits in some places that\u2019s clearly above any macro environment. We\u2019ll continue to focus in those places like Europe that we\u2019ve talked about on the previous calls. I think going forward though, Kelly, I think you\u2019ll also see more in the emerging markets from us. That\u2019s where a lot of the investments are at this point as well as capabilities like access points that will enable us to continue to accelerate this. So as far as organic versus inorganic, this is just about growing the business as we historically have and we think in all parts of the business right now we\u2019re doing a nice job with growth.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital", "Is there any way to think about maybe not actual numbers, but the profitability differences between Europe and maybe the rest of the world kind of order of magnitude even?", "D. Scott Davis", "No. We really don\u2019t break out regions. These regions are all interconnected but certainly we\u2019re pleased to make investments in Europe and do expect to continue doing that going forward.", "Jim Barber", "We do well in all regions.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Good morning, guys. If I could circle back to supply chain specifically on the forwarding side, I think you made the comment that \u2013 maybe it was Scott \u2013 that overall exports out of Asia were accelerating. You guys have some relatively easy comparisons from some company-specific efforts but yields overall, you had made the comment as well, still are pressured some. Could you provide some perspective in terms of how to look at the back half of the year within that segment specifically on the yield front given some of the capacity management efforts in Asia across the industry into what appears to be an accelerating export environment, but still a very competitive yield dynamic? Can you provide some perspective there?", "D. Scott Davis", "Sure, Ben. It sounds like you got a pretty good handle on it. But Jim, maybe you could flush it out a little bit and talk about our look going forward.", "Jim Barber", "Sure. I think we should start with the fact that airfreight is just one of the products, so we should brokerage North American. It\u2019s really doing well in many, many parts of the business. With respect to airfreight out of Asia, yes, we do see the market tightening. Yes, it is a competitive market. You can see in our growth rates we just talked about that we\u2019re actually bringing new customers on with the capabilities in the network. We are evaluating increases as the market tightens. We\u2019ll do that. We\u2019ll continue forward. We talked about a year ago making sure that we relied less on a couple of concentrations. I think we\u2019ve done a great job across the industries to get us where we are today and we\u2019ll continue to manage that in a very dynamic environment. And of course in the back half of the year oftentimes product launches appear that help us manage through this and balance that as well. So, good stuff coming out of the airfreight business all around.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning. Congrats, David and Scott. All the best to you.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Bill.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I have a question on B2C and of course you folks have seen the post office's moves on pricing. Can you talk about how that will affect your efforts and what it means from a dim weight perspective or from a pricing dynamic and the U.S. perspective? I realize B2C is getting to be a big part of the business now, over 40%, so I\u2019m not sure how to think about what dynamics are with the post office if they take actions how it affects you?", "D. Scott Davis", "Bill, this is Scott. I\u2019ll start off. First of all, it\u2019s not unusual to see our competitors suggest rates. The USPS though really does not offer the same level of service and capabilities that we do at UPS. I think the technology is a differentiator, our integrated service offerings are a differentiator, our guarantees are different. At the same time, we work very closely with the post office. We appreciate their universal service mandate where customers of theirs are customers of ours, but there is some concern as we go forward and how they price competitive products and there is some concern about cross-subsidization that we\u2019re going to be working with the Postal Regulatory Commission to ensure they don\u2019t cross-subsidize the competitive products. An example, I guess, is only 55% of the USPS costs are actually attributable to products. The rest of those costs are institutional costs and only 5% of those go to the competitive products while 20% of the revenue is from competitive products. So there are inconsistencies there that we\u2019re going to work with the Postal Regulatory Commission on and we\u2019ll pay attention to as we go forward. At the same time we\u2019ll go out and compete with the post office.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "D. Scott Davis", "Good morning.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "So I wanted to follow up on pricing and maybe the answer is just the post office, but clearly there are some capacity issues here. You [had them] (ph) in peak. The rails are struggling. I\u2019m wondering why aren't you guys talking more about pricing and getting more aggressive with pricing? And then beyond the dimensional pricing on ground, are there other specific things you can do like that to start seeing some better pricing and to offset some of the mix?", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, clearly and certainly the dim weight was a good example of pricing that helps to match our cost to our rates and we clearly look at that. We have said in general that 2014 is the year of investing for the customer and creating unparallel service and that was a higher priority than short-term price issues. But, Alan, clearly you guys do a lot of thinking and activity in this front. Maybe you could talk.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. So obviously the market continues to change with the B2C volume making up a bigger concentration of our business and we all see that that results in lower yields due to lighter weights and the mix between the products and the customers that are using those services. We\u2019re continuing to calibrate our pricing models to make sure that we\u2019re aligning to the service that we provide and the price and a long-term strategy remains to achieve that 2%, 3% annual base price increase. Certainly the dim weight initiative that will begin at the beginning of 2015 will help bring us to the higher end of that base rate increase. We\u2019ll also encourage our customers to take a look at their packaging practices and we\u2019re already working with lots of customers in that regard right now so that they understand the impact of the dimensional weight changes. And either way if they change their packaging, UPS gets a nice cost advantage as do our customers or they\u2019ll pay for the size of the packaging.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "But given some of the cost issues and tighter capacity, you don't see an opportunity to go above 2% to 3% in this environment?", "D. Scott Davis", "We aren\u2019t looking for dramatic changes. We make sure that over time we are appropriately compensated. Certainly next year will be a little different story than this year. Our primary focus this year is capacity and service. So we\u2019ll talk about that more going forward.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "Good morning, everyone.", "D. Scott Davis", "Good morning, Scott.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "Scott, congratulations. Hopefully, you\u2019ll get some more time on the golf course going forward.", "D. Scott Davis", "I\u2019ll give it a try, Brandon. Thank you.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "David, welcome to the spotlight. I guess my question is going to be a little difficult here, but I mean over the years we've all come to think of UPS as really geared for growth. If you go back talking about how your domestic business should grow around GDP if not above it, well, we\u2019re in that environment now. The last couple of Teamster contracts, we\u2019ve always discussed how they are geared for that incremental growth, the incremental package in the network and now with the deployment of ORION, obviously that could be a game-changer. And yet here we are in our third year of sub double digit EPS growth. I mean is this just a structurally different phase for UPS as we transition away from the previous B2B model to B2C or maybe for the next few years, we\u2019re not going to be able to hit that 10% to 15% EPS growth target that you guys put out a few years ago?", "D. Scott Davis", "Brandon, I\u2019ll start and then David can certainly add some perspectives. The challenges you highlight are real and we\u2019ve been talking about adapting and migrating our model to profitably grow with B2C volume. If you look at '12 and '13 up until the fourth quarter, we showed expanding margins driven by B2C growth. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as bleak as you\u2019re painting it. And clearly the challenges remain but we think we\u2019re well on those. So we\u2019ll clearly talk about the long term and the future in November a little more. But right now we feel like we\u2019re doing the right things to build for the future. David?", "David Abney", "What we see now with the accelerated volume trends, we probably should have been investing at a slightly faster pace. We do see changing distribution patterns for customers around the world and we\u2019re wrapping up investments this year by about $500 million primarily in capacity projects. And this additional CapEx is mostly of projects that we already had planned, we already knew we were going to do them. We\u2019re now just simply advancing them from the outer years due to the accelerated volume. So even with this acceleration and capital projects, we still expect CapEx to remain in the 4% to 4.5% range during the next few years.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe a question around peak season and the planning. Obviously, the conversations have been ongoing for several months now around customer behavior. And I guess I just want to think without using price necessarily as a strong or blunt instrument around customer behavior in the peak season, how do you sort of adapt and get customers to sort of focus on shipping at the right times when the network has a little bit more flexibility and a little bit more capacity? How are those conversations going in sort of the absence or I guess not necessarily using price as the key tool to adjusting that behavior?", "D. Scott Davis", "Yes, certainly we said one of the key components of our peak preparation was increased visibility with customers and improve planning the collaboration. Alan, you guys have been on that very much these days.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. We obviously have a long history of collaborating and communicating with our customers. But as you said, due to these changing trends the importance of us getting closer to our customers and working joining on collaborative operating plans is the order of the day. So, we\u2019re working with our customers on special weekend operations. One of the areas that we\u2019re working very closely with them on is their omnichannel strategies and whether or not they should be fulfilling from their DCs or fulfilling from their stores. And that certainly helps us manage their business better and also do it at a more effective cost.", "D. Scott Davis", "One of the parts of our peak planning has been joint commitment sessions with our customers certainly focusing on the highest peak periods and making sure that we have capacity that\u2019s needed. And if there\u2019s volume in excess of that, then there may well be a yield adjustment for that incremental volume.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup", "All right, that was very helpful. Thanks. Congrats, Scott and David.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thank you.", "David Abney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Arthur Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats Scott and David. I want to go back to this pricing thing. A lot of questions about pricing today, but it seems like as you've said 2014 is the year of investing for the customer. Is it possible that 2015 is going to be the year of charging the customer? And a couple questions about that as we think about \u2013 as I think about some of the comments you've made today, do you feel like you need to have a clean peak season from a service perspective before you can start to move price? And secondly, is a potential peak season surcharge in the offing for this year?", "D. Scott Davis", "First of all, we definitely are planning and expecting a clean peak season. We\u2019ve invested heavily this year as we\u2019ve talked about at length. We think we\u2019re prepared. We\u2019re working very well with the customers. So we certainly expect a real strong peak season in 2014. As I said, this year is about investing for the customers. And as I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see the level of OpEx required in 2015 that we saw in 2014. But if e-commerce conditions change again in 2015 to drive more OpEx, I think we\u2019ll have to evaluate everything. Everything is on the table and that could include a surcharge to peak in the future.", "Arthur Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens Inc.", "Hi, guys. Thank you for the time. David, it sounds like you\u2019ve had some very extensive conversations with your customers here over the course of the last several months as you assume your new role. I was just curious if you could give us a sense for how you are expecting peak season to unfold both in terms of international airfreight and then on the domestic side, just from your conversations with those customers? Are you expecting to see some tech product launches beyond what we've seen in the past couple of years? Just trying to get a sense for the order of magnitude relative to what we've been seeing call it over the last three, four years.", "David Abney", "All right. Well, as far as the tech launches, every year to the third and fourth quarter we normally do see tech launches and we expect that that continue again next year. In fact we\u2019ve heard some pretty good indications of that and we have shown in the past where we can wrap up rapidly and we handle these tech launches really as good as anybody could out there. So we look forward to it. As far as the international freight, Jim, as it goes to peak season, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.", "Jim Barber", "Well, I think the great part about the network and the way we\u2019ve got it set is they launch and both the airfreight side as well as the small packaged side, the network is able to handle that. And as David said, we do have some information about launches coming. We work with those typically a couple of months out to make sure the customers and we satisfy their needs and their consumers. So, I would say to this specific question we kind of see the next couple of quarters similar to the past couple of years and some tech launches coming and our ability to participate in those accordingly.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens Inc.", "Great. Thanks again for the time.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Kurt, you mentioned in your earlier comments about changing distribution patterns in Europe and David, you also mentioned that distribution patterns were generally changing around the world. Can you expand on those comments specifically on how distribution patterns are changing for Europe? How well UPS is positioned to handle that? And how those changes of operations or the additional capacity you\u2019re ramping up is looking to address this?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I\u2019ll start off at a high global level and then have Jim maybe talk a little more granularly. We are continuing to see transport or shipments, regional shipments grow at a faster rate than trans-ocean shipments. So intra-Europe, intra-North America certainly seems to be a higher \u2013 have a higher velocity and you can see that in our mix change, in our yield change. So, that\u2019s one of the big themes. Europe\u2019s been a strong story for intra-Europe shipments with the convergence to the EU, but we are seeing some areas show a little more growth than others. Jim, maybe you could talk.", "Jim Barber", "Well, I think it really just comes down to the fact that Europe as a single market is continuing to evolve. Your distribution centers where they are placed there move and as that economy grows and it moves out to the east, the distribution models move with it. The inventories move with it. Our transport or network will support it in a different way, those patterns change and that\u2019s a good thing for us to have our network. I think the investments that we\u2019re talking about quite frankly are more in the hubs now and our hubs are \u2013 the growth patterns you\u2019ve seen in international now are forcing us just like the U.S. continue to force in our hubs to keep that network flowing appropriately and that\u2019s what we plan to do over the next couple of years. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s behind the trade pattern question.", "David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus", "And does Cologne have enough capacity to handle it as you expected or are there other hubs that need to pop up to kind of supplement it?", "Jim Barber", "It\u2019s be a great day when we build the next Cologne because it\u2019s got \u2013 we\u2019ve built it quite frankly for about 10 more years of growth and the most recent investment and can continue to scale. We love that investment and it will serve us well for a long time to come.", "David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus", "Excellent. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "David Campbell of Thompson, Davis, & Co., please go ahead.", "David Campbell - Thompson, Davis, & Co.", "Yes, thank you for taking the question. Back to Europe a little bit, there is obviously a lot of economic and political hotspots over there; Russia, the Ukraine, Israel, Iraq. Any impact on your business from any of these disputes, the wars, disputes, whatever you want to call them?", "D. Scott Davis", "I mean straight up, I would say those business markets for us right now we\u2019re obviously in those markets, I think we\u2019ve done a good job to kind of manage through those and have an operating model that\u2019s flexible and variable depending on what happens. But most of those markets for us are still what we would call emerging markets and we\u2019ve kind of kept back some of the big investments there to be tailored to the trade that we\u2019ve talked about earlier and the way that we\u2019re ready to invest. So at this point, we feel like we\u2019ve adjusted that adequately and results in the international business you can see haven\u2019t been affected at all.", "Kurt Kuehn", "There\u2019s not much impact. Yes, we still pay attention to what could happen to Ukraine, could that impact Poland or Syria could impact Turkey and those type of things. So we pay a lot of attention to it. So far no damage.", "David Abney", "From an airline standpoint, we closely, closely monitor world events and make sure that we make the appropriate changes to our air network.", "David Campbell - Thompson, Davis, & Co.", "And last question is, is your international airlift capacity down? I see that the tonnage is down from last year. Is your capacity down too?", "D. Scott Davis", "Our block hours are pretty much flat with last year, so maybe slightly down but not much.", "David Campbell - Thompson, Davis, & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Mr. Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Thank you. I have a long-term question on your Asian network. Based on the aircraft order book, cargo, capacity and passenger belly hold is likely to grow faster than airfreight demand structurally. First off, would you agree with that and if so, do you have opportunity to become or to rely much more extensively on third party capacity? And in that vein, does that mean that you need to expand your freight forwarding capacity much more significantly than what you\u2019re capable of today? Thanks.", "David Abney", "I\u2019ll start off. Asia to U.S., our network is built around 7.5 trunk routes and that changes a little bit and we watched it closely. It is down 20% from 2011. We\u2019ve also placed larger aircrafts, so that\u2019s one of the things that has helped us in that area. So, yes, especially with the growth of worldwide expedited products, it does give you a lot more options to move the freight. You can hold it to take advantage of capacity. It\u2019s less capital intensive and we can utilize common carriage more for that product and we certainly do.", "D. Scott Davis", "Just a note I think we did foresee this. That\u2019s part of why we made a big investment into a forwarding capability back in 2001. Thanks.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the SurePost growth that we saw in this quarter, could you elaborate a little bit on where that\u2019s coming from and what your expectations are looking forward? It\u2019s been over 50% the past couple quarters and I was hoping to get a little bit more color on that line.", "D. Scott Davis", "Sure. Alan, you want to take us through it.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. So the growth is certainly concentrated but it\u2019s concentrated in one industry and that\u2019s retail. However, it\u2019s wide scale throughout our enterprise customers and also our middle market account. And really what you\u2019re seeing is shipments are choosing UPS because of the array of solutions we provide not just the SurePost product. And as you heard earlier, really all of our air and ground products, our residential products are growing, our commercial products are also growing but certainly SurePost grew with that 60%.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Ms. Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison Landry - Credit Suisse", "Thanks for taking my question. Just on the cash flow and some of the expense headwinds you have coming through in the second half, I was just wondering if there was any update on your plans to repurchase 2.7 billion of shares this year which I think you outlined in your fourth quarter conference call. Are you guys still expecting around that level?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, absolutely. Our commitment to shareowner distributions remains unchanged. Actually our CapEx although reoriented more towards ground and technology facilities and vehicles than airplanes remains quite low, so we will be in the 4% plus or minus category. And so, yes, our share repurchase continue. We\u2019re pretty much right on pace for completing our $2.7 billion commitment for this year.", "Allison Landry - Credit Suisse", "Okay, that's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research", "Thank you very much and congratulations to both Scott and David.", "D. Scott Davis", "Hi, Jeff. I got to say that on my first call in 2000, you asked my first question. Today you\u2019re going to ask the last question.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research", "We\u2019re coming full circle. A lot of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the maintenance expense. It\u2019s not your largest expense, but I was a little surprised. It was up 10%, particularly with block hours kind of flat. Did we see any deferred maintenance this quarter from first quarter? Is there any reason why it would be at this level?", "Kurt Kuehn", "No. The biggest driver of it is just the cycle of aircraft maintenance. Clearly, there is some expense in there as we began during some retrofits and buildings, but it\u2019s really driven by just the normal large B&C checks for airlines, Jeff, and we do expect that to continue for a couple of quarters.", "David Abney", "Yes, it\u2019s really the aging of some of the new aircraft that we bought over the last few years. They\u2019re in for their first real maintenance check now and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it. It\u2019s just block hours and a time issue.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research", "Very good. Well, Scott, please enjoy. Guys, thank you.", "D. Scott Davis", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Wilkinson and panel for any closing remarks they may have.", "Joe Wilkinson", "Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Scott Davis.", "D. Scott Davis", "As I said, this is my 14th year of hosting these calls with either the CEO or the CFO and we\u2019ve delivered a lot of different messages over those 14 years. But this quarter believe it or not was our largest domestic volume increase, 7.4% that we saw in those 14 years, so it\u2019s pretty impressive to get that kind of growth. So the markets are moving in the right direction. Clearly, 2014 is a year that we are investing for the customer but we expect an excellent peak season and in the future, these investments will clearly benefit not just the customer but also our employees and our shareowners.", "Thanks so much.

Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings review. Before I get into the business results, I want to take a moment to express my personal sadness about the tragic shooting that took place at one of our facilities in Birmingham, Alabama. We\u2019re a close knit team at UPS and this incident has touched all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones of those involved. The safety and well being of all 400,000 UPS-ers is a high priority for us and I\u2019m extremely proud of how our people responded to this tragedy, especially those in Birmingham.", "Now I would like to discuss our third quarter results. Balanced performance from all three segments delivered a record third quarter for UPS. Earnings improved 14% over last year to $1.32 per share. Total shipments increased 6.9% to 1.1 billion packages, the most ever in a non-peak quarter. The strong performance for the small package team provides momentum as we head into the fourth quarter.", "Overall, the global economic outlook has been mixed with primarily good news coming out of the U.S. and Asia while disappointing reports have recently surfaced in Europe. Trade between countries is a primary catalyst for economic growth. As part of my participation on the President\u2019s Export Council, I just returned from a visit to Poland and Turkey where we discussed practical ways to increase U.S. trade with these two important countries. UPS is a strong advocate for free trade agreements such as the trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trade pacts currently in negotiations. The key to advancing such trade agreements is the passage of Trade Promotion Authority. This legislation gives the administration the ability to negotiate trade agreements and present them for an up or down vote. We urge Congress to take action on this critical legislation.", "Looking more specifically at UPS, current market trends have provided a favorable environment for growth and we have been active this quarter enhancing our portfolio and expanding our capabilities. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of i-parcel. This cross-border e-commerce company facilitates the globalization of online retail. i-parcel dramatically simplifies cross-border trade by helping businesses localize their website, providing consumers in over 100 countries a seamless buying experience from the U.S. and UK based retailers. Cross-boarder e-commerce sales are expected to triple by 2018 to more than 300 billion. We are excited about the unique capability this acquisition brings to advancing the UPS global retail strategy.", "We also announced the expansion of two solutions aimed at enhancing the consumers' experience. Following a successful U.S. launch, UPS My Choice is now operating in 15 additional countries in Europe and North America. International consumers can now receive the personalized home delivery experience that 11 million U.S. members currently enjoy. Also, we expanded the UPS Access Point alternate delivery network to New York and Chicago with more U.S. cities to follow. By the end of 2015, we plan to increase the number of locations from 12,000 in Europe to more than 20,000 worldwide. This is a great example of how UPS continues to implement innovative ways to increase B2C profitability and improve the customer experience.", "In addition to these new solutions, UPS continues to invest around the globe. We announced new locations in Poland, expanded our forwarding and distribution networks in Myanmar and Thailand, while opening facilities in Mexico and Canada. Here in the U.S., we have increased network capacity to support our growth. These enhancements benefit UPS throughout the year and continue to prepare us for peak season. In a moment, Myron will take you through our peak plans and expectations.", "We\u2019re continuing to invest in our network enabling UPS to capitalize on sustained growth. Let me assure you, UPS is ready for the opportunities and challenges we expect to face this year.", "Now I would to turn it over to Myron.", "Myron Gray", "", "Thanks, David and good morning. UPS has been preparing for peak season 2014 since December 26th last year. We\u2019ve made significant investments in new technology as well as both permanent and temporary capacity. The improvements we\u2019re making will produce benefits for UPS far beyond this year\u2019s peak season. Our people have been working hard to get everything ready for the holiday volume surge that typically starts during Thanksgiving week. This year the National Retail Federation is forecasting a 4.1% increase in total retail sales, a full 100 basis points higher than 2013. More importantly for UPS, online retail sales are expected to jump between 8% and 11%. This continued surge in web-based sales is not only fueled by online retailers, but also by the rapid adoption of omni-channel solutions. In fact, according to a survey conducted by Hay Group, 47% of retailers will have an omni-channel strategy in place compared to only 14% last year. These trends create opportunities and challenges for both retailers and for UPS. That\u2019s why we've focused on increased collaboration with our largest retail customers.", "Agreements on shipment volume during peak season are critical to meeting both customers and UPS's expectations this year. During these discussions, customers have expressed their confidence in our ability to meet the peak season needs. At UPS, we\u2019re gearing up for this growth. We\u2019ve added a full operating day on Black Friday in the U.S. and are bringing 49 additional hub sources online.", "In time for peak, we\u2019ll have 47 new, expanded or temporary facilities around the country. This added capacity provides the flexibility to handle higher volumes more efficiently. For example, we\u2019ve opened expanded facilities outside Los Angeles and two in the Houston area. We also announced the opening of two new buildings in the fast growing Dallas market. North Bay, our first retrofit automated hub, will be operational in November. We\u2019ve also made improvements to our two largest facilities, Worldport and our Chicago consolidated hub adding sort capacity and unload doors. In addition, UPS has invested in the development of approximately 30 new technology solutions. These applications will improve package visibility, volume forecasting and customer communications.", "The UPS network and technology systems are ready for the wave of shipments we expect this peak season. In fact, for the month of December, deliveries are projected to increase 11% over last year. If current expectations are too optimistic, we will make adjustments to align network capacity to lower demand.", "Before I turn it over to Kurt, I have been visiting UPS facilities across the country, talking to our people. I walk away even more convinced of the great skills and passion our employees have. We\u2019re well prepared to handle the holiday surge and provide world-class service to all industry sectors. UPS is ready for peak.", "Now we\u2019ll turn it over to Kurt to discuss our results. Kurt?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Well, thanks, Myron and good morning, everyone. After three tough quarters in a row, it\u2019s great to be discussing positive results again. In fact, revenue growth was the highest we\u2019ve seen in three years, up 5.7% over the third quarter of 2013. Global shipment volume of more than 17 million packages per day was 6.9% higher than last year. Operating profit increased 8.3% with growth across all segments. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 13.7%, our best non-peak results since 2007. Earnings per share of $1.32 were up 14%, aided somewhat by a slightly lower tax rate. Overall a solid quarter across the board.", "Now I\u2019ll take you through the segment details, looking first at U.S. domestic. revenue increased 5.3% to 8.7 billion resulting from a 6.9% increase in daily packages. E-commerce continues to be the catalyst for growth. However, B2B shipment gains of 3.4% were the highest we\u2019ve seen in several years. Operating profit of $1.3 billion was 7.8% higher and margin expanded 30 basis points to 14.7%. Revenue per package declined 1.5% as product and customer mix changes offset base rate improvements. The primary reason for the yield reduction was the more than 50% jump in UPS SurePost volume. Total cost per package decrease by 1.9% leading the positive operating leverage. Several factors drove our cost per piece lower. We benefited from improvements in productivity, wage rate deflation and reductions to workers' compensation expense. These gains helped to offset the additional peak related projects and excess cost created by continued rail disruption.", "Now looking at our international segment. Total revenue improved 5.5% to $3.2 billion. Daily shipments increased by 6.7% with all regions of the world showing solid growth. Operating profit was up more than 10% to 460 million and margin expanded by 70 basis points to 14.5%. Local revenue and cost initiatives contributed to the margin expansion, while favorable currency and fuel prices also added to the bottom line. Average daily export shipments jumped by 9.4%, the result of robust growth out of Asia and Europe, up 16% and 14%, respectively. Volume from Asia to both the U.S. and Europe benefited somewhat from high-tech product launches at the end of the quarter.", "Non-U.S. domestic shipments improved by 5% with Canada, the UK and Italy leading the way. Revenue per package currency-neutral declined by 1% as a result of a 3.5% yield reduction in export products. High demand and shorter trade lines and product mix continued to pressure yields and offset base rate increases. Non-premium products grew by 16%, while our premium products grew by 5%.", "Turning to supply chain and trade. Revenue improved 7.4% to $2.4 billion with gains from all three business units. Operating profit of 215 million represented a 7% increase and operating margin was the same as last year at 8.9%. Forwarding and distribution revenue increased 7.4%. Forwarding benefited from higher air freight tonnage primarily in the government and high-tech sectors. In distribution, increased demand from retail and health care sector customers added to revenue gains.", "Our forwarding operating profit was down. The spread between third-party providers and customer rates out of Asia continued to pressure operating profit growth. Distribution operating profits improved as growth offset investments in acquisitions, technology and new facilities. UPS freight revenue was 7.9% higher due to LTL shipment increases of 4.7%. Both operating profit and margin improved and ground freight pricing growth has contributed to these positive results.", "Now for an update on our cash position. Through the first nine months of 2014, UPS generated 2.8 billion in free cash flow. Adjusted for one-times items, free cash flow was 4.6 billion. The company has paid 1.8 billion in dividend so far in 2014, representing an 8.1% increase per share. UPS has also repurchased nearly 21 million shares for approximately $2.1 billion. Year-to-date capital expenditures reached 1.4 billion and we do anticipate more than 1 billion in additional CapEx in Q4 as a significant number of projects will be completed in the fourth quarter.", "Looking at our expectations for the fourth quarter, as Myron told you, we expect to see higher demand for UPS services and we are ready for the increased volume. In the U.S., we expect average daily volume to increase between 5% and 6%. Yield should be down about 1% as a result of the continued SurePost product gains. Operating profit is expected to increase 11% to 13%. As we previously mentioned, we expect approximately $115 million in additional operating costs in the fourth quarter due to Black Friday operations, temporary capacity additions and the ORION implementation costs.", "For the international segment, reported growth rates are projected to slow in Q4 as a result of a number of large wins late last year and the addition of one extra U.S. operating day this year. Average daily volume and total revenue are expected to grow between 3% and 4%. International operating profit is expected to improve by 10% to 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013. In supply chain and freight, we expect mid to high single-digit revenue growth with similar operating profit gains. Our tax rate is forecast to be 35% for the fourth quarter.", "So in summary, UPS produced solid performance this quarter and we\u2019re maintaining our full year guidance for earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5. We look forward to sharing our outlook for 2015 and beyond when we meet in New York next month.", "This completes our prepared remarks and we\u2019re ready to take your questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein", "", "David, could you talk a little bit about how the profit profile or the contribution from B2C growth has been changing over time and whether it\u2019s reasonable to believe that the steps you guys are taking are making that business a little bit more attractive at the margin? Just trying to get a sense for how the profile of that business has changed over the years.", "David Abney", "", "Well first, I\u2019ll you that it\u2019s certainly a journey. And we have seen our B2C business grow and we\u2019ve announced that it\u2019s up to 45% this year. One of our focuses though has been, to prepare for this trend, a lot of the technology that we have implemented has been focused around not only B2C, but B2B. So ORION is a good example of that, hub automation again is another example. But then, Alan, in just a minute, will talk about some of the expansions we\u2019ve made in products that will not only reduce our costs, provide better service, but will also help us adjust to this changing trend even more. So, Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "", "First, I\u2019d say that you guys know that most of our growth these past few years has come from B2C and overall profits and margins have improved. And along with creating the value for the retailers and consumers, obviously achieving acceptable levels of profit is absolutely central. And if you take a look at all of our newer services and solutions, they\u2019re all designed to drive down cost by improving stock and/or delivery and pickup density economics. So you've got SurePost and SurePost redirect that improves delivery density and lowers delivery cost. UPS My Choice, which I think David mentioned, launched in 15 more countries helps us reduce those unsuccessful delivery attempts. And then obviously UPS Access Point, which right now most of what we\u2019re doing there is delivering to the Access Point after the first delivery attempt, but the ultimate goal is to have shoppers be able to pick Access Points right from the retailers' website get it directly to the Access Point or UPS My Choice customer directing it directly to the Access Point and that obviously changes residential stops into commercial and improves delivery density.", "Operator", "Question will come from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs", "", "I was wondering if you could elaborate and share your thoughts on the potential impact of Amazon sort facilities for the coming quarter and how is it affecting your planning around the peak season? But also more importantly, as Amazon focuses increasingly on not just sort facilities, but obviously the fulfillment ability, how that sort of shapes your views on CapEx going forward?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well Thomas, we don\u2019t comment specifically on any specific customer. But clearly, we\u2019re working very closely with all our major shippers. And it\u2019s an evolving market and UPS is continuing to adapt to that. But the suite of capabilities we have we think continue to make us a tremendous player in this space and we\u2019ll continue to.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "", "I want to talk about pricing, because obviously you have a unique service here along with your peer as you go into peak season. It sounds like you've put a lot of preparation in delivering a better service outcome. But I think historically you\u2019ve talked about 2% to 3% as your avenue for core price gains. Can you talk about where that's been trending this year and what you hope to do? And I know you're going to provide guidance later at the analyst meeting, but just longer term where do you hope to get that price and what are the aspects that are going to drive that gain?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well clearly we pride ourselves on being very disciplined over the long-term on pricing and this year the priority has been added capacity, meeting customer needs and having the superior quality we\u2019re known for. I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan a little bit to talk about the revenue management process and the rate announcements we\u2019ve made recently.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "So first, I think we all know that the market continues to change with B2C volume making up bigger concentration of our business and that is really driving down the lower yields due to the lighter weights in shifts and product and customer mix. As you know, we stick to that 2% to 3% annual base price increase. This year we have been much closer to the 2%. Next year, we plan to take that up. Certainly the rate change we just announced at 4.9% for ground and air, as well as the DIM weight initiative are great examples of addressing the yields due to shifts to the lighter weights.", "Operator", "", "The next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup", "", "Another question on the guidance, particularly for the fourth quarter. When you think about sort of last year and some of the expenses that you had that were specific probably to that year and you think about where it might -- looks like it\u2019s trending this year, it feels like the implied growth is sort of on the low end. I\u2019m trying to get a rough sense to sort of how you guys are thinking about it, whether there is implied conservatism baked in there or if we\u2019re thinking that sort of the dynamics of this holiday may be different than ones in the future. I guess I just want to get a rough sense of maybe how you guys are thinking about incremental margins around the holiday, because it would seem that that guidance number is a little bit on the light side?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Well, there is a lot of noise in the comparisons for Q4 this year and last year. And if you peel those back a little bit and look at some of the extraordinary events that happened last year and what we\u2019re doing this year, it makes a little more sense. We are looking to spend approximately $115 million in peak and project related expenses in Q4 and so that does reduce the year-over-year increases we\u2019d be seeing otherwise. But if you take that out, I think you\u2019ll see that there is a -- we\u2019ve got a good core margin approaching 15% and a solid improvement. So this year is focused on capacity and capabilities and we do think we\u2019ll have a good profit quarter, but we are spending some unique expenses this year to make sure things happen.", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "And just wanted to follow up, it sounded like you mentioned, David, earlier some sort of cap on volumes as you moved into peak season with some of the large customers. Can you talk about that, talk about how the discussions have gone as you prepare for the peak in terms of ensuring that you can get your kind of next day and second day delivery done around kind of that potential cap that you talked about?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Ken, this is Kurt. I\u2019ll link this one together that, really this is a twofold process. We have a control tower process for peak. And I\u2019ll have Myron talking about the operational alignment on that and then Alan talking about the customer alignment. So Myron, maybe you could start off on our operational connectivity this year.", "Myron Gray", "", "So Ken, early in the year and all of this year we've been working very closely with the high impact customers to assess what they think their volume needs are going to be for the fourth quarter. So we have worked them to determine their shipping needs as well as we've implemented new technology that will give us a view into what their shipping patterns are. So if they exceed the projected volume quotas that they have given us, then we have an advanced opportunity to go back to them and mute what they\u2019re giving to us. And this control tower will be managed by senior leaders in the organization. So I\u2019ll give Alan an opportunity to address that.", "David Abney", "", "Before he does, I want to just talk a little bit more about this control tower, and this is certainly a byproduct of the increased visibility that we\u2019re going to have this year. So we\u2019re going to have a much better idea of not only our volume, but of the planning process. And this control tower will also allow us to do just the opposite. If we see that we have capacity on a certain day and we\u2019ve got a key customer that wants to give us more than we forecast, we have this visibility, we make that decision and we will certainly take that additional volume. And it can be the same way for us for other shippers that need to surge one way or the other. So good visibility, good planning, it allows us to make decisions on a day-to-day basis and we see it as a real capability to be able to take care of our customers\u2019 needs. Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "", "I will just add quickly that the collaboration with the customers this year as well as the forecasting tools that we have in place is unprecedented. The primary focus is on delivery reliability with the customers. Again, they talked a lot about this control tower, it\u2019s made up of engineering, ops, sales and revenue management and we'll assess capacity and we\u2019ll determine rates and surcharges as needed. But the primary focus here is on network reliability and then after that, certainly what we get paid for, right volume at the right price.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Just so I understand what you\u2019re saying, have you ever said that\u2019s a cap for a customer before? Is this a new thing or is this a regular kind of ongoing thing or is this changing how you operate in terms of taking business?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Ken, I think the best way to look at it is it's a refinement and we\u2019ve increased visibility and increased collaboration, both internally and externally. So we\u2019re moving forward. Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Next question will be from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Derek Rabe - Raymond James", "This is Derek Rabe on for Art. As we exit the peak season and head into 2015, obviously coming off a strong year of investment into the network in 2014, how do you feel like the network will be from a capacity perspective coming off of the peak season? Will there be a lot of excess capacity that would need to be fielded such that we'll see some pressure on pricing coming out of the peak?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I can speak to that. Clearly, we\u2019re seeing continued growth. This is not by any means just a peak issue or fourth quarter. So we\u2019ve shown some of the strongest growth both domestically and internationally we\u2019ve seen in a while. So this is not by any means to say speak season event. It\u2019s just we\u2019re talking about peak right now, because it's that time of the year. But we think that the changes in e-commerce and omni-commerce are here to stay.", "David Abney", "And you have to remember that some of the capacity that we\u2019re putting on this peak is temporary affordable capacity that we can turn on and off with any of the major hub expansions or modifications will be utilized throughout the year.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "", "I was curious if you can share a couple of data points with us. Maybe where is B2C running so far this year? Where do you think it will be in the fourth quarter? But probably the most important question is really where does that max out? How high does this number go as a percent of total? How do you think about that?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Bill, it will be talked in quite a bit about the long-term outlook in a few weeks, both on, as David said how we\u2019re adapting our operating model, as Alan talked about how we\u2019re enhancing service to be profitable. We were about 45% B2C in the U.S. in the third quarter. Certainly, that number is continuing to grow, although we\u2019re seeing, as we\u2019ve mentioned, good strong robust growth in B2B as the industrial base of the U.S. picks up. So more to come on that. We\u2019re not making any forecast right now, but clearly we\u2019ll be talking about the long-term in a few weeks.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "It\u2019s materially higher though in the fourth quarter, is that right?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research", "", "I want to ask you a little bit about Kiala or I guess UPS Access Point as we call it. What did you learn as you expanded it in Europe and how -- other than just being a place where customers can get packages on a more convenient basis, what role do you see it playing here in the U.S. and how do you think it affects you financially, whether it's lowering the cost of delivery, whether it's resulting in a different revenue yield? How should we think about Access Point as it rolls out within the U.S.?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It\u2019s a great question. Jim Barber was there to help implement when we did our first acquisition at Kiala and so he helped to establish that. And Jim, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ve learned?", "Jim Barber", "", "Jeff, I mean I think the value of that investment in the U.S. will be very similar to what we had and continue to develop in international. Effectively, it has seven or eight different value points, of which I am not going to over all of them on the line. We\u2019ll do that in New York when we\u2019re with you. But it does create different economics in a B2C or retail package that we think help both the customer and UPS to scale the investments and go forward. So we love the investment and I think New York you\u2019ll see the same thing that we see today.", "Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research", "As this rolls out though, I guess as I'm thinking about it from a modeling perspective, is it more of a cost-reduction opportunity for you in terms of reducing the amount of failed deliveries or is it more of a revenue opportunity for you in terms of an easier delivery front to the customer? How should I think about the financial impact?", "Jim Barber", "Let me start and I\u2019ll take both sides and give it to Alan for a little bit more color as well. It\u2019s both, to be honest with you, it allows the B2C economics to move much more towards a B2B set of economics, so you\u2019ve got the cost side of it as well. But from a revenue perspective, it allows different pickup origin points and access points for customers which gets into the revenue management side as well. And I think Alan will add a couple of points to that.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Every delivery angle is better economics, whether we deliver it directly to the access point or we deliver it out to the \u2013 to send again to the consumer\u2019s house. The way I would think about access points and we\u2019ll talk about this more at the investor conference is in totality with the whole ecosystem with UPS My Choice and now even i-parcel, so we\u2019re the only ones with an Access Point and UPS My Choice network on two continents and now with i-parcel, we\u2019re going to be able to enable domestic retailers in the U.S. and the UK to basically have access to consumers in over 100 countries around the world and those consumers will be able to shop seamlessly just like they\u2019re shopping in their own country.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "", "Maybe switching gears here looking at the international sector, we saw a very good tonnage and shipments, but I think you still highlighted you're still seeing some yield pressure. As we look at that, what do you think is putting more pressure on your International yields? Is it the growth in non-premium products still or maybe the strength you're seeing in some of the shorter-term trade lanes?", "Kurt Kuehn", "It\u2019s really both of those, Kevin. But I\u2019ll let Jim talk a little bit to some of activities going on in our International Express business.", "Jim Barber", "So it really is both of them. I mean if you saw the growth rates, we had some very, very strong export growth rates and some reasonable domestic growth rates as well in the middle single digits in some of our bigger countries. So the combination of those put pressure on the yield. But ultimately the job is to match the network to the yield and create operating margins and leverage and continue to invest in the network. So we\u2019re comfortable with that. We told you last quarter we had the mix improvements in Europe where you can start to see those economics comp sequentially across the quarters and we\u2019ll continue to do that. So it\u2019s a combination of the yields and obviously the operating efficiency in the network.", "Operator", "", "We have a question from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Just a small question. Can you help us think about the impact of fuel and currency in the quarter? Not sure if they were small helps or big helps or what. And then maybe how you\u2019re thinking about those two items in the fourth quarter?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "Fuel was a slightly positive for the international, not much on the domestic side. Currency clearly has been very volatile. Fortunately with some hedging, it actually was a little bit of a support in Q3, although as we look at Q4, our comps year-over-year for currency, especially the euro, will be a drag. So both of those were a mild positive for this year, but we do expect some currency headwinds as far as profits are concerned in Q4.", "Operator", "", "And we have a question from the line of Ms. Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison Landry - Credit Suisse", "So I wanted to ask about your guidance for SCS for the fourth quarter in terms of mid single digits, high single digit revenue and operating profit growth. If I think about the guidance you gave for 3Q, you had called for low double digits for operating profit growth and it came in somewhat less than that. And as I think about the fourth quarter last year, the comps were pretty easy. So I was wondering if you could maybe provide some commentary on what\u2019s going on there.", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "I think we\u2019re pretty pleased with the progress of most of the segments there. The distribution group is continuing to show solid growth and upper single digit margins. UPS Freight is on a controlled growth strategy with improving margins. The international air freight has been the primary challenge. And we did see a pick up in demand and tonnage, but the market is such that still our sell rates and revenue generation are not able to offset some of the increasing rates at Asia. So, a little bit of a classic margin squeeze, it wasn\u2019t severe, but it was a challenging quarter and we expect that that will mute results a little bit in Q4, although clearly Jim and his team are doing a lot of work on broadening our base for forwarding. Jim, do you got any thoughts on that front?", "Jim Barber", "", "I would say it's one of those issues that with tonnage and shipment fuel growth in the middle teens, that\u2019s a good problem to have. It says our customers like our solutions, they like the fact that we\u2019re connecting their supply chains across the globe. The buy/sell rates we have moved very quickly in the third quarter. We talk about this a number of times over the quarters and internally we've kicked off an internal work team to look forward over the next couple of years to look at how we do this and make sure that our speed and flexibility changes to the environment and we look at other value drivers to get to other customers to kind of change the mix in the network as well.", "So again, we\u2019ll probably talk about this as well in New York. But it\u2019s an area that we think there's a good opportunity for us to improve going forward and we plan to do that.", "Operator", "", "We have a question from the line Mr. Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar", "I\u2019d like to ask about purchase transportation, which looks like it moved up a bit faster than revenue, up 15% from last year. What\u2019s behind this? And related, have you had to shift volume off of rail to truck the past couple of quarters to maintain the service you want for your customers?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "We did see a big increase in purchase transportation, very similar to what we saw in Q3. And the factors there are multiple actually, because there is a lot of different moving parts in that. The biggest one clearly is increased forwarding expenses. I said we did see a large increase in tonnage, double-digit tonnage, which does drive up the PTE. In addition, our SurePost product that has rapid growth, that\u2019s where the payments for third party show up. So the growth in that is included in that. And some of the international expenses for delivery for the final mile show up there with outside contractors.", "So it\u2019s a number of issues. We are certainly seeing some inflation in the over-the-road rates. And as we mentioned in the second quarter, we have taken some volume off the rail and that does show up and driving some increases in purchase transportation. So a lot of moving parts, some of it driven by revenue growth and some in some other conditions.", "Operator", "", "And we have a question from the line of Mr. Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird", "Just wondering if you could provide any sort of update in terms of where you are with regard to the appeal with the EC\u2019s decision, the interpretation of market dominance that stemmed from the TNT bid. Are you expecting any sort of final resolution here in the coming months?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "No, we think that's still a long ways off. And as we said, our primary purpose of that appeal was just to avoid having a precedent set that creates a very narrow definition of the market. So that\u2019s an important one, we think, because it may be used in other areas more than this specific transaction.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "You guys have addressed your flexibility for the seasonal peak. I'm just curious delving into the hiring capacity, since last year, obviously, you ended up hiring a lot more seasonal folks than originally planned and the number above what you did last year. Could you address just on the human capital capacity your abilities to flex there?", "Kurt Kuehn", "We have stated that we expect to hire 90,000 to 95,000 this year in the U.S. and that\u2019s against an actual hiring of about 85,000 last year. So it is an increase, but not totally out of the range. Myron, maybe you could talk a little bit about how we manage that.", "Myron Gray", "We have experienced to date no issues with bringing on additional personnel throughout the U.S. But in addition to that, our capacity to train has been enhanced by adding additional Integrad training sites across the country. We have added five additional Integrad sites that should ease the burden of training additional employees. And as we ramp up throughout the peak season, we foresee no issues at all.", "David Abney", "I think one significant difference between last year and this year is last year we had to reactively near the end of peak try to put on a lot of extra employees. This year we\u2019ve got increased volume going into peak. And because we have such better visibility in forecasting, we\u2019re actually putting these people in place a little bit earlier and they are trained and they\u2019re ready to go so that when peak does fully engage, they will be able to pull their weight. So much more of a proactive view this year versus reactive.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Mr. Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "", "David, you had talked a little bit about Europe earlier. Could you give us an update in terms of what the trends you are seeing month-to-date in October? And then, Kurt, as we look out to 2015, can you give us a sense of how the movement of the euro will impact the P&L and to what extent you've already hedged at this point?", "Kurt Kuehn", "I\u2019ll start off with the hedging. We have gone out a couple of years actually on the euro, although last year we were at about a 136 and our hedge is at about 133 for the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re in decent shape going out for the next couple of years, but it depends where currencies move and the volatility does create some challenges. So I\u2019ll let Jim maybe talk a little bit about the trends in the business he's seen.", "Jim Barber", "As some of the opening comments alluded to, we have a fourth quarter that\u2019s going to wrap over some big wins in the fourth quarter last year. So that will actually kind of dampen some of the growth, but the growth is fine. It\u2019s exactly where we plan it to be. It\u2019s controlled growth that\u2019s a combination of continuing to invest in the network and the revenue management practices that you can see starting to come true. So we\u2019re off to a good international peak as well and we plan to continue to manage that as such. So fourth quarter looks good so far.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "So have you seen any deceleration with some of the reports of weakening in Europe?", "Jim Barber", "Well, with regard to the economics of Europe, that\u2019s one thing, but I think if you look back over the years, the economics there versus the way UPS performs don\u2019t actually have that big of a correlation. We continue to go in and with the brand where it needs to be, invest in that market and we\u2019ll continue to do so.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie", "", "If you could give us a little bit more magnitude on the growth you're seeing on the B2B side, also if you're seeing more activity in B2B outside of retail. I know that's been the key driver for you guys before, but some of the other companies that have reported have talked about growth being more broad-based. So wondering if you're starting to see that yet in B2B volumes outside of retail.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "As Kurt reported there, our B2B growth has been the strongest this quarter at 3.4%. And while you do get some nice B2B growth out of B2C or retail which is really part of our overall B2C strategy, we\u2019re seeing much more broad-based growth. Industrial manufacturing is certainly growing much stronger than it has and our solutions are really resonating in that area and our sales and solutions teams are winning.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie", "But then, should we start to then -- can you help us think about what the operational leverage -- you finally seem to have B2B coming back. Is there any way to think about what that does from a profitability perspective?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well certainly if those trends continue, then it\u2019s good news because it increases the density and just helps the network overall. We do think that there is an industrial renaissance of sorts in the U.S. And so as low energy and other advantages that the U.S. has continue, that does bode well for balancing our network. So we\u2019re -- nothing specific right now, but clearly we\u2019re pleased to see some of the revitalization.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ms. Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker \u2013 Cowen & Company", "I just wanted to -- had this question. With respect -- today, in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal, your pilots took out a full page ad. I thought it was kind of surprising to me because I\u2019m not sure what message they're trying to send. And I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re -- if you can comment at all without necessarily negotiating publicly what your takeaway from that is.", "David Abney", "", "Well, first, you just have to consider that we are in negotiations. And the big thing that I would want you to take from that ad is the quote that they remain committed to delivering your holiday in 2014. That\u2019s what they are paid to do, that\u2019s what our contract covers that they would do and what\u2019s what we would expect them to do and we appreciate the fact that they made that commitment. But we\u2019re going to continue to negotiate in good faith and we\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right for the company, we\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right for our pilots. And we\u2019re not going to discuss the specifics of negotiations here, because we think that it\u2019s best left at the bargaining table.", "We just want to remind everyone that we are covered under the Railway Labor Act, so these contracts do not expire. They become amendable and the contract term stay in force. The National Mediation Board, the IPA and us asked the NMB to get involved in the negotiations and they did so six months ago and they are now controlling the pace and timing of those negotiations.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel.", "David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus", "UPS Freight, I wanted to talk about that for a second. The tonnage accelerated in the third quarter, looked pretty good, while yields decelerated. The first half of this year, you had flattish volumes, but yields were up 3% to 4%. What was driving that? Was there an increase in bundling activity in the third quarter or another change in the market approach?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "We\u2019ve been very strong results on the yield front if you look over the last couple of years, so some of that is really just wrapping some of the industry leading improvements we've seen. But I'll let Myron talk a little bit about our continuing focus on the middle market and leveraging our connectivity to grow the business profitably.", "Myron Gray", "", "The Freight group continues to see steady improvement year-over-year. But as we've professed before, they will continue to see opportunities for growth. We have a continued discipline growth strategy focused on profit and not necessarily market share. We\u2019ll focus on the middle market customers utilizing our ground sales force as well as the continued expansion in technology that we'll utilize to seek growth with. So we expect to continue to see steady improvements in our Freight Group.", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna", "I want to follow up a little bit on an earlier question on pricing and specifically around the peak. So if e-commerce growth does continue at this double-digit pace going forward and the customer behavior doesn\u2019t drastically change about wanting the packages coming to the door, when do you start to invoke price as a primary lever in driving margins higher around the peak? And maybe talk a little bit about what sort of future approach is to peak season pricing you\u2019re seriously considering today.", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "We\u2019re certainly watching closely market dynamics and we do overtime convinced and sure that we\u2019ll be able to get paid for the value we create, although this year the priority was on enhancing our capabilities. We do price for peak, in some cases anyway and I\u2019ll let Alan talk a little bit about that. But we prefer to set long-term contracts with customers and then adjust around that. But Alan, maybe you could expand a little bit about the conditions in which there is peak pricing?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "", "So certainly as we look at our customers' forecasts and what we agreed to on a year around basis as well as peak, there is some variability in what a customer wants to give us. Certainly there is always the opportunity to put in some sort of a peak surcharge for that additional business. And I think that your comments are certainly something that we\u2019re taking a very close look at. We've got to manage this business on a year around basis and we certainly understand that peak season is becoming more and more of a step up phenomenon and we can\u2019t build a network, or as Kurt always says, we can\u2019t build a church for a day.", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "So more to come on that front.", "Operator", "", "And due to time constraints, our last question in queue comes from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson Davis & Company. Please go ahead.", "David Campbell - Thompson Davis & Co.", "I just wanted to delve in a little bit into the same-day delivery business. This is a business that seems to be, by Google and Amazon and other companies, accelerating. How does that impact UPS? Doesn\u2019t it take business away from Next Day or Ground business as people get more and more deliveries the same day?", "Kurt Kuehn", "", "That certainly is generating a lot of press. Other than drones, I can't think of anything else that seems to grab the headlines. There are some markets where that same day is an important element and we\u2019ll talk about this at our investor conference. But we think that the majority of Internet shopping anyway happens late afternoon and evening and that the real hotspot is going to be local next day delivery and that\u2019s something we\u2019re working very closely with a number of brick and mortar retailers on to be able to fill from stores that have inventory in that metropolitan area and make deliveries the next day. That\u2019s where the bulk of the demand is, that\u2019s where the economics make sense. So more to come and we\u2019ll be talking about this at our investor conference. So thanks for your call.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wilkinson.", "Joe Wilkinson", "Thank you, Stephen. I appreciate all the questions today. We look forward to seeing you in the investor conference. And I\u2019ll turn the floor over to David Abney for final comments.", "David Abney", "Thanks, Joe, and thanks to all of you for participating in my first earnings call as the CEO. And the results discussed this morning represent the effort of more than 400,000 UPS-ers and they\u2019re working very diligently to develop, test and implement new technologies and they\u2019re really making good progress. And we have set high expectations and our people are really excited and they\u2019re ready for the upcoming challenge. I am confident that they will make a real difference.", "You can see we\u2019re adapting to the rapidly changing marketplace. The growth opportunities are many and we look forward to reviewing them with you during the New York conference. We\u2019ll update you at that time on our long-term strategy and of course I am looking forward to share my vision for UPS at that time. So, thanks again for joining us and have a good Friday.

My name is Brad. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkins, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. The floor is yours.", "Joe Wilkins", "Good morning and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in detail in or 2013 Form 10-K and 2014 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "As previously disclosed there were two accounting events that influenced our fourth quarter and full year results. First, expense recognition related to our company-sponsored pension and postretirement plans. A 90 basis point decline in average year-end discount rates more than offset improved asset returns. This led to a noncash mark-to-market after tax charge of $670 million.", "Second, recent contract gratifications triggered the recognition of $22 million in after tax charges for our second quarter transfer of certain Teamster employees to union healthcare plans, neither of these charges affect benefits paid to plan participants or required pension funding. Ignoring the impact of these charges, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.25 and GAAP earnings were $0.49. A tutorial has been provided on the IR website to provide additional information on mark-to-market accounting.", "In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS's free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call along with a reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website\u00a0and just a reminder, as on previous calls, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.", "Now we'll turn the call over to David.", "David Abney", "Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings review. By now I suspect almost everyone on the call reviewed the press release and Kurt's audio message from January 23, those that did understand that we're disappointed in fourth quarter financial results but pleased with our strong service levels. Peak season 2014 provided us an opportunity to deliver excellent service during periods where UPS volume more than doubles. To meet the challenge, we invested in capacity with new facilities, automation and expanded operations. It was important to fortify the trust of customers and protect our brand and from that perspective, UPS was successful.", "UPSers around the world went the extra mile to ensure service levels remained high throughout the holiday season and our customers were delighted with the results. The management team and I received numerous calls and emails from customers of all sizes. They expressed their appreciation for the efforts of UPSers. I'm extremely proud of our team and the service they provided this year. And while we met our commitments to serve customers, we certainly did not achieve our financial objectives. Executing an efficient operating plan to meet the surge in demand is complex.", "Ultimately, we erred on the side of caution and built an operating plan that would provide superior service if volume levels exceeded expectations, contributing to higher than expected costs.", "In addition, the rapid growth of online retail over the last few years has pushed us beyond our normal peak workload and limited our traditional economies of scale. To illustrate the enormity of peak season, consider that during this peak we averaged over 30 million deliveries per day. Looking back just two short years ago, that's about 6 million more per day than we handled in 2012. In those two years, we saw peak volumes go from 55% above our average day to 75%. This is a trend we expect to continue as e-commerce expands its influence over the retail sector.", "Going forward, there are two clear paths to improved results. As we laid out at our investor conference, UPS will continue our long term initiatives to invest in technology and capabilities, ultimately bending the cost curve lower. While at the same time we will pursue specific revenue initiatives that will improve yields and ensure we achieve our financial objectives.", "Looking shorter term, there were obvious cost overruns that will be addressed. On the operating side of the equation, we will improve production with a tighter dispatch, improve helper utilization and reduce overtime. We will expand hub capacity in key areas ultimately reducing the need for temporary sorts. Additional hiring and training costs associated with staffing the new sorts and facilities will be reduced going forward with the permanent capacity expansions. We made the decision to conduct full operations on Black Friday this year with the expectation of smoothing the network during Cyber Week. While we did achieve benefits for our hub and feeder network, the pickup and delivery network was underutilized. In 2015, we will adjust operations as needed.", "Purchase transportation expense including contract carriers in TOFC will be optimized with more efficient use in 2015. In addition, we will improve our cost profile through the acceleration of ORION deployment and enhanced operation technology. We will be implementing peak residential surcharges that are differentiated from our nonpeak time of year on a customer segmented basis. These surcharges will focus on SurePost and residential packages. In some cases, these changes will be implemented over a multi-year period as contracts come due. These pricing strategies will be designed to ensure we're properly compensated for the value we provide. We will align revenue with cost, extracting the value for the investment in our network, especially during peak periods.", "The control tower was put into effect in 2014 and was mainly focused on capacity management. In 2015, the control tower will continue to focus on capacity management and also be utilized more for revenue and yield growth opportunities. I'm confident our team will manage costs, tighten up the plan, keep service levels high. At the same time, we will implement rational new revenue actions to improve yield during this period. UPS has a high value offering in the market which our customers appreciate. These steps will further align value, cost and yield. Overall, the other two business segments performed fairly well this quarter and Kurt will provide you more details in a moment.", "Looking to the future, the global economy is expected to be modestly stronger in 2015 with global GDP and exports increasing at a faster pace. While the U.S. economy is expanding, parts of Europe and Asia are expecting slower growth. Fortunately for UPS, there are opportunities for growth outside general economic expansion.", "E-commerce is expected to outpace global GDP growth by fourfold and cross border e-commerce at 7 times. Concentrated investment in growth industries like healthcare and retail put UPS in the position to capitalize on market expansion. One way our government can help advance economic growth is by supporting global trade. We were pleased hearing the President's support for advancing trade promotion authority. We continue to urge Congress to pass PPA legislation that will facilitate new trade agreements. Free trade enables businesses to gain access to new markets and compete on a level playing field.", "Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to emphasize that we're resolute in improving the financial performance of the company. During the next couple of years, the cost initiatives will provide escalating benefits and the revenue strategies will continue to be implemented. We're 100% committed to our long term financial targets that we shared in November. UPS is focused on the key points of our long term strategy which include investing to position UPS for future growth, developing innovative industry-specific solutions and adapting our B2C delivery model to improve profitability.", "Keep in mind this is a multi-year transition. 2015 will be a year of progress and we expect solid growth in all three business segments. I'm confident we have the right strategy, the right solutions and the right people to deliver on these objectives.", "Now Kurt will take you through the financials.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Thanks, David and good morning everyone. Back on January 23, I shared with you our performance during peak season and I also committed to provide you additional details on today's call. Now I'll provide you with more information on our results, as well as further insights into what we expect in 2015. UPS fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.25. The U.S. Domestic segment results came in less than planned due to higher than anticipated peak operating costs. Meanwhile International results were in-line when adjusted for currency and onetime items and the supply chain segment was pretty much on plan. On the positive side, our revenue growth was 6.1%, the best we've seen in some time.", "Now I'll take you through the segment details. The U.S. Domestic average daily package volume for the quarter was up 6.6% driving total revenue up 7.5%, daily shipments for ground increased by 7% which includes over a 28% jump in SurePost shipments. Deferred Air increased 11% while Next Day Air declined by 3%. The drop in Next Day Air was primarily due to changes in the holiday calendar and distribution channels including the proliferation of omni-channel. This year retailers employing a local distribution strategy increased by 50% and the number of stores participating was up by 30%.", "Products distributed closer to the consumer have resulted in some trade down from premium products, package yields declined by 0.8%. Underlying base rate increases were offset by lower fuel surcharges and changes in product mix. This does mark however another quarter of improving trends in both reported yields and underlying base rates. Operating profit was $63 million lower than last year as operating margin contracted 150 basis points to 11.4%. In total, U.S. domestic operating cost was more than $200 million higher than anticipated.", "During the quarter, operations ran well in October. However, the opening of an unprecedented number of new buildings and sorts in November caused a notable decline in productivity as operations geared up for peak. Early seasonal hiring and training, as well as working nontraditional operating days, contributed to excess hours. As a result, direct labor hours per day increased by 11%, outside carrier costs were up 65% due to both increased usage and higher rates. Also contributing to the cost overrun was the disruption to our network from the West Coast port dispute. On a positive note, we're seeing benefits from ORION as miles driven increased just 5.8%.", "As David mentioned earlier, we're committed to lowering our long term operating costs while at the same time implementing pricing strategies that ensure we're properly compensated for the additional cost of peak season operations.", "Now looking at our International segment, the volume growth was healthy and operating profit showed positive momentum. In fact, if you strip away the currency impact and the onetime items, fourth quarter performance was very good. Total International revenue when adjusted for currency was up 5.9% and daily shipments increased by 4.3%. Our International Export volume was up 5.2% with high single digit growth in Europe and double-digit gains on the Europe to U.S. trade lane. Average revenue per package was down 0.6% on a currency-neutral basis. This is actually a continuation of an improving trend in yield.", "Total operating profit was flat with last year at $536 million and operating margin declined slightly to 15.6%. International results were negatively impacted by the fluctuations in global currencies, lowering operating profit by $40 million. UPS does hedge the major currencies like the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. However, the volatility and rapid devaluation of our unhedged currencies in comparison to the U.S. dollar weighed on results.", "During the quarter, the segment also experienced $30 million in onetime items including a restructuring charge in Europe. The International business experienced increased in-country expenses especially in Europe where demand during peak season exceeded network capacity and did push costs higher.", "Now turning to Supply Chain & Freight which performed pretty much in-line with our expectations, revenue was 7.4% higher due to strong growth in Distribution and UPS Freight. Operating profit was up 5% to $179 million with an operating margin of 7.3%. Forwarding revenue improved slightly during the quarter primarily from strength in North American Air Freight. Operating profits declined as gains in Ocean and North America were offset by the continued challenges in the International Air Freight unit. Distribution revenue was up more than 10% while operating profit improved by 9%. Growth in the retail and healthcare sectors offset a slight decline in high tech. UPS Freight expanded operating profit and margin over the prior year. Revenue increased by 8.6% to $773 million during the fourth quarter. LTL tonnage increased by 5% and LTL revenue per hundredweight was up 2.4%.", "Now for an update on our cash position, for the full year 2014, UPS generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow. This includes after tax contributions of $800 million to company sponsored pension plans and $1.5 billion for the transfer of certain union employees to multi-employer healthcare plans. UPS made capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion, slightly below our $2.5 billion guidance due to the timing of project payments at year-end. In addition, the company paid dividends of $2.4 billion, an increase of 8.1% per share. UPS repurchased 26.4 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion. In total, the company returned over 100% of net income to shareowners in 2014.", "Looking now at our expectations for 2015, as we look at the year, continued investment in making the business model more flexible and adaptable will weigh more on operating margin expansion than originally anticipated. However, this is absolutely the right thing to do to position UPS to capitalize on future market growth opportunities. The company expects growth across all business units with earnings per share of 6% to 12%. This includes a $240 million headwind from pension expense and currency. Overall operating profit is expected to improve 5% to 9%. Total shipments per day are anticipated to rise about 4% with revenue up 3% to 4%. Excluding the fuel impact, underlying revenue growth would be 5% to 6%.", "Now looking at the segments, the U.S. Domestic Package volume is expected to increase by approximately 4% with revenue up at a similar rate. We're expecting solid base rate improvements due to dim weight and other and other pricing initiatives. However, the gains will be mostly offset by lower fuel surcharges which will be around a 200 basis point drag on package yield. Operating profit is anticipated to increase by 5% to 9%. International shipments should grow by 3% to 4% with revenue growth of 2% to 3%. Falling surcharges in International will lower yields by approximately 300 basis points. Operating profit is expected to increase by 6% to 12% with currency being a $50 million drag.", "Supply Chain & Freight revenue is expected to grow 2% to 3% as faster growth in Distribution and UPS Freight is offset by revenue management actions that we will be taking in Forwarding. Operating profit is expected to increase approximately 5% with modest margin improvement. UPS Freight will be challenged by the decline in fuel surcharge revenue as it isn't fully compensatory at the current low fuel prices. Total company 2015 diluted earnings per share are anticipated to increase 6% to 12% to a range of $5.05 to $5.30 and our effective tax rate is anticipated to be about 35.5%.", "Looking specifically at the quarters, there will be variability in the quarterly results due to the year-over-year comparisons. We expect the first and fourth quarters' earnings per share growth of be higher than the year's average while the second and third quarters will fall below. Looking at the balance sheet, we're planning 2015 capital expenditures of approximately 5% of revenue or about $3 billion as hub automation and capacity expansion projects accelerate. Share repurchases in 2015 are expected to be $2.7 billion continuing our philosophy of robust distributions to shareowners and of course, dividend growth will remain a priority.", "So 2014 was a year of demonstrating our ability to handle the peak surges and we met that challenge. 2015 will be a year of continuous improvement and positioning UPS for the future. Advances in our strategic initiatives have great potential for the company. E-commerce growth, operations technology implementation, emerging market expansion and industry-specific solutions will all provide momentum for UPS as we move throughout this year and into the future.", "Well thanks for listening. That completes our prepared remarks and we're ready to take your questions. I'll turn it back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citi", "Just wanted to ask I guess a question on pricing and the outlook for 2015. Kurt, as you kind of laid out the Domestic outlook on the revenue side, ex the fuel headwind, it seems like maybe there is I think a consistent amount of core pricing embedded in the guidance. I guess I just want to understand, as you're taking on some of these pricing initiatives to offset some of these costs, how quickly can you start to realize that? How much is in 2015? Does it take a little bit longer, 2016, 2017 and beyond to catch up on that pricing side? Thanks.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes. Chris, you're right. There is certainly underlying momentum and if you look at the quarter-to-quarter changes, you can begin to see some of that picking up already. We did say at our investor conference that we expect our base rates to be at the high end of the 2% to 3% targets that we normally have. So we're well on our way towards that, but it is a long term process and I'll have Alan talk a little bit about some of the moving parts with that.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, so we're certainly expecting throughout 2015 including peak, to see additional revenue for piece improvements just like Kurt alluded to last year. We saw quarter-over-quarter gains from the second, third to the fourth quarter and that's going to continue into 2015. Certainly the Ground dim weight changes are going to impact the 2015 results. We're also continuing to work with our customers on their packaging to obtain mutual cost reductions. So we will see a little bit of impact there on the cost side. So we're going to see improvements throughout 2015 and it is going to be on the high end of the 2% to 3%.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, although it certainly will be masked a bit, as I said, with fuel surcharges down a couple hundred basis points, but we feel very confident that the underlying momentum is strong.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon", "So it sounds like the overshoot on costs in this fourth quarter and I'm trying to understand how the $200 million extra that we spent in the fourth quarter kind of plays into the guidance for next year. Should we be expecting that that level of inefficiency that we saw in the fourth quarter you guys are sort of baking some of that into the model or are you guys also adding additional operating expense into 2015 that's keeping that cost recovery that we had been expecting in this year from last year out of the numbers and out of the guidance numbers?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, maybe let's start, David, I know, wanted to at least put a recap onto peak season of 2014. He can talk a little bit about what our intentions were and then we can migrate from that into guidance.", "David Abney", "Yes, first, our main priority going into peak was protecting the brand. After 2013, we just felt that was something we absolutely had to do. We were successful in doing that. We also made significant progress working with our customers in forecasting capacity, vision, visibility and communications, but the cost associated with providing this quality of service was greater than expected. We built our operating plans to accommodate higher volume and that was based on the volume surge of 2013. So we certainly erred on the side of caution. We did overbuild to some extent and that is the basis for some of our 2015 initiatives where we will be able to eliminate some of that expense lessons learned from 2014.", "Kurt Kuehn", "So I think as we look into 2015, we were certainly a little concerned and surprised at the challenges of opening up so many operations in November. It's really unprecedented for us and that was the primary disconnect I think that happened between where we thought we were heading. Just bringing that much capacity on after what had been a breakneck speed on the engineering and operations side getting ready overshot. So we're a little cautious I guess going forward, twice burned thrice wise and so as we look into 2015, this forecast does assume that a higher portion of that expense -- the peak season added expense stays with us.", "Clearly over time, we will work through it, but right now at least that guidance does assume more drag in the fourth quarter. Certainly the revenue will help to cover that because we do feel that cost is maybe more structural than we thought. That's why we're focusing more on revenue. We do think over time though fourth quarter will become much more profitable. It wasn't too many years ago, just a couple of years ago where the fourth quarter was our most profitable quarter but it is going to take us a few years to get there.", "David Vernon", "And does the guide also have some of that peak season surcharge in it as well?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Some portion, yes.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Kurt, coming off that comment about how the fourth quarter used to be the most profitable. I mean, you know, David in your prepared remarks here, obviously your customers like the service that you provide in the fourth quarter definitely better than where you were in 2013 and with 6% volume growth and operating earnings down, I'm sure customers do like that outcome, but your shareholders obviously have a little bit different priorities here which a lot of them are taking significant risk investing in a cyclical stock like yours.", "And if we can't convert the upside right now in a very robust growth period, ultimately we're going to be exposed to a lot of cyclical downside whenever the economy does potentially roll over. So I guess with you being in the leadership role here for the last half year now, what is the real priority of UPS going forward for the next few years because it's been a while since you guys have hit your long term earnings growth targets and it seems like the discussion here is all about additional capacity, additional service. It doesn't sound like there's a lot of aggressiveness to take yield from customers which are obviously benefiting from all these additions you have put in the network.", "So can you tell your shareholders what is the priority here? Is it really returns and a financial focus or is it more about protecting the brand and potentially this is a cycle where we just don't hit those long term growth targets because we're putting so much capacity in the marketplace and underestimating on the pricing ability?", "David Abney", "Well first, let me tell you that we certainly take our responsibility to our investors very seriously. In fact, when I talk about this first priority of protecting the brand, we believe that was necessary in order to take care of the interest of our investors, but let me focus on and I know we covered it at the investors conference, but, based on peak, I'll really focus on a couple of things to solve the peak issues that we saw and then we can of course talk about the entire year of 2015.", "One is it is a cost reduction story and we're going to ask Myron in just a second to really focus on some specific things that we're doing that will be in the best interest of the shareholders, lessons learned, lessons learned, things that we will be able to improve this year. We can also talk a little more long term. But the other thing and we mentioned it at the investor conference, but the tone is much, much stronger today is that we're taking this revenue management side very serious. The fact that we realized some of these extra costs in peak are going to be with us for a few years has just made us that much more determined. So what you're hearing today is that we absolutely will charge our customers more for the extra costs that we have in peak and that we absolutely are pushing our foot down harder from a revenue management side.", "So Myron, why don't you talk a little bit about some of the cost initiatives and what you're going to do this year?", "Myron Gray", "Thank you, David. We will continue to ultimately bend the cost curve lower by our continued deployment of ORION, by the end of 2015, we will have over 70% of our drivers deployed. We'll continue with automation and modernization and then, of course, there are other operational technologies and innovations that we'll continue to focus on such as driving density with SDS, SurePost Redirect and we're going to continue with our deployment of Access Points to take cost out of the system.", "As David and Kurt both alluded to earlier, we erred on the side of caution considering the peak surge of 2013. However, there were a lot of lessons that were learned. I'll give you just one example, we made the decision to conduct a full operation on Black Friday in the intention of smoothing out demand on our network during cyber week. While that benefited our hub and feeder operations, we did underutilize our pickup and delivery operations. We'll make the necessary adjustments in 2015 to cut the cost.", "David Abney", "And just wanted to sum that question up, we\u2019re certainly focused on our long term strategies. We're 100% committed to the long term financials that we reviewed for the time period 2015 through 2019 during our investor conference. So we have not backed up from those numbers. We do have some challenges that we have to address and we certainly will do so.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Tom Wadewitz", "I wanted to focus a little bit more on the revenue actions that you're talking about. It sounds like this is primarily focused on peak, but is there any element of saying that's broad or that says we just need to be more aggressive on price and so we're going to look for more in base rate with our B2C shippers? And also I guess just in terms of understanding the magnitude I think you said $200 million difference in cost in fourth quarter. I don't know if you would say it is $200 million or more than that shortfall in operating income probably more than that. So is half of that shortfall going to be on these peak season price changes, so you're looking for a couple hundred million or what's just the magnitude of that pricing change when you look at the peak? Thanks.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well clearly Tom, the solution for the fourth quarter for us in peak is really two-pronged. We're going to need to improve operations, streamline it, lessons learned, find how can we scale up 100% without driving our marginal cost so high that it's unprofitable and we've got a number of initiatives there both physical capacity and operating changes. And then the other path equally important is the yield side to make sure that for that disproportionate increase, we do need to increase yield and also as we've talked, certainly we're more focused on yield in aggregate because of the -- last year was a brand-building and capacity-building and this year clearly the value is there. So Alan can talk a little more on the revenue side.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes certainly, as we said before, the Ground dim weight changes are going to amplify the impact in 2015 and go a long way to increasing the yields and specifically in the B2C market, as well as more broadly and as peak has become more costly, there has been additional pressure on the margin. So going forward, we do plan to better align the revenue against this increased cost. So we're going to focus on residential and peak surcharges for specific customer segments and we're firming our strategy to better align revenue with costs during peak season as well as throughout the year. Certainly also very focused on the value creation that UPS does with our customers and ensuring that we're getting paid for that.", "David Abney", "One other addition to the peak pricing is this past year we really focused on a control tower from a capacity management standpoint and we had a lot of success from that end. This year, the control tower is still going to be focused on capacity management, but also will be focused on taking more revenue action for those real peak weeks. So it's going to be a big step for us from a revenue management standpoint.", "Kurt Kuehn", "I think one thing maybe we could bridge to a little bit is certainly the revenue management is a critical part of peak. Outside the U.S. where we're a little farther ahead with some of our alternative delivery modes, we're looking at both revenue enhancement and also some cost reduction with our Access Points network. So Jim maybe you could talk a little bit about how the e-commerce surge is working for you guys internationally.", "Jim Barber", "Sure. I think that, Kurt to that point, I think one thing you have to first look to is that as you move outside the U.S., depending on what part of the world you are in, you have got different market characteristics, capabilities and situations and operating models. So it really does present us some unique opportunities as we've grown this International business to experiment in different ways. ", "Our Access Points are up to about 16,000 outside the U.S., when we bought that company; they were at about 6500 so we've organically over doubled that network. It's providing us good opportunity and benefits in this B2C space to actually get at this and provide different solutions to customers and you would also probably have noted the acquisition of i-parcel that gets us into this cross-border e-commerce as well here recently that we plan to roll out globally. So lots of change on the forefront and International provides us a great platform to experiment and grow the business.", "Operator", "And we do have question from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Bill Greene", "Kurt or David, I wanted to ask you about the rest of the year. So obviously, peak has all of its challenges that we're aware of given the increase in the peak volumes and you'll do what you can with the surcharges and whatnot and I'm sure you'll work hard on the cost there, but is there something to be said for trying to smooth this out not by managing peak but more increasing the volume in first, second and third quarters to the point where if we have added structural costs, the average profitability in the other periods gets much better and peak will just do what peak does? So the real key here is getting more balance through increasing throughput in the first three quarters to adjust for those structural costs. Is there an argument for that or does that not make sense in your mind?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well, Bill, it's a great argument. We would love to have the rest of the year pumped up that high if we could scale to it. Certainly what you're seeing is an industry in transition and part of the challenges that we're wrestling with is this factor of peak versus the rest of the year has gotten much more extreme. So what used to have very low marginal cost for us as we grew the volume has gone beyond that. I think one silver lining to your comment is that we're seeing an uptick in our commercial growth. Our B2B business was up over 3% in the fourth quarter.", "So as the U.S. economy has begun to broaden its expansion and the industrial manufacturing components grow, that does actually help to grow the other quarters frankly. What we have seen up until last year was a small package growth business driven primarily by B2C which exaggerates the Q4. So Alan I know has a big focus on these industry-specific solutions and Alan, maybe you could talk about how are we tackling the opportunity and the rest of the segments.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "We've certainly seen a revitalization of growth outside of the B2C retail market. Five of our top six industries are growing now and we're very, very focused on healthcare, high tech and the industrial manufacturing segment and creating value for those segments to create more year-round type of opportunities for UPS versus the peakiness of retail.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Nate Brochmann", "I wanted to follow up back on Tom's question regarding the pricing and getting the surcharges and that certainly all makes sense in terms of going back and getting paid for all that high service. But how far kind of going back to a question not too, too long ago, how far do you think you can really push that without foreseeing those various shippers to go in a different direction? You\u2019ve often talked about maybe some competing opportunities out there for them and I know it's a growing space, but how do you balance that in terms of pushing that price to the point where you don't push your shippers to go think of different alternatives?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Clearly that's the judgment that we have. We have long term relationships with our customers and we tend not to have dramatic price swings as part of the value proposition as a large company for us to do. But that is clearly part of the activity and Alan, I know you guys have talked about but this is really a multi-year cycle as contracts come due, right?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. So you're right, but we do have a long history of revenue management that balances aligning the revenue with the cost and also the value that we provide to our customers while maintaining a fair and rational pricing environment. So we think that the GRI we just implemented, the dim weight changes that we're already seeing the effect on are going to pay some dividends in 2015. It is a multi-year process with some of our customers because they do have multi-year agreements, but we do expect to see positive results from the actions we're taking during 2015.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter", "In terms of using the tower for volume seemed to work well in trying to allay some of the volumes to different dates, but adding 100,000 temp workers for a few days. How quickly can the surcharges be implemented to smooth out those peak days and when you think about getting a return on the investment for the $3 billion? You're jumping CapEx nearly 30%. So just wondering the balance of those permanent costs in hiring 100,000 workers with the returns on those price increases?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, it is very difficult to just will the tower ever recover. Your incremental costs for just those few pieces over a threshold are challenging, that will be just one of many mechanisms that we deploy. So it is a multipronged process. We've accomplished the first step which was maintaining and sustaining the value of the brand and our commitment to our customers and going forward, as we said, we'll both reduce our costs with more streamlined operations as we get a little smarter in handling these spikes and also pursue revenue in a number of fronts, not just control tower.", "David Abney", "As we invest in the capacity of our buildings and facilities and vehicles and others, you got to remember that we still expect a real high return on invested capital. And we've said before, we'll continue to say that we expect a 25% to 30% return. So these investments are made with the investor in mind and it is to get the return that our investors have become used to and that we certainly are committed to continuing.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Sterling", "Kurt, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about products being closer to the consumer which resulted in some trade down from premium products. I want to ask you kind of going forward do you think this trade down will continue as you say more distribution centers are built? I would think this trend might continue that way, but I would love to hear your thoughts looking forward regarding products closer to the consumer in the trade down.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, Kevin, I guess there is really two things that are going on. One of them is really a comparison to last year where a number of customers given the challenges of peak accelerated and traded up, but the other one is more of a structural issue and we do think that Next Day Air, at least for B2C fulfillment is likely to decline over time. We think the B2B as the industrial base grows there is good opportunity. But, Alan, I know this omni-commerce omni-channel is quite a trend that's revolutionizing retail.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, so like we've said before we're seeing a significant amount more of our brick-and-mortar retailers utilizing the inventory from their stores to fulfill the e-commerce needs of their distribution centers. So this year, we've got about 120 retailers, nearly 22,000 stores that have the ability to ship packages now using omni-channel solutions and this year we've added about 41 retailers and more than 5000 stores in 2014. So we expect this trend to continue and certainly echo Kurt's comments on how the retail industry and e-commerce is going to handle the overnight or shorter shipping timeframes.", "Kurt Kuehn", "It does make for some year-over-year changes in distribution patterns that keep us busy though.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group", "So wanted to follow up on the pricing, there has been good kind of broad discussion, but maybe we can put some numbers around it. Is there any way that you can talk about how much your cost per package has gone up domestically and maybe that's a way to quantify how much pricing you need to get to offset that cost? And just along those lines, just want to understand is the idea with the peak surcharges that fourth quarter is going to start being the most profitable margin quarter again?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well certainly that's our goal over time, Scott. We think it is the time when the capital is fully deployed, so to recover cost of capital for that it should have our highest margin. It's also the time of the greatest demand. So for I think six years up till 2012 we had I think both the highest margin and the highest profit in the company in the fourth quarter. So is this a challenge for the company? Absolutely. Have we figured it out and operated successfully in the past? Yes. It's just gone beyond that economy of scale to where the added volume is creating diseconomies. We will get this solved. It is a two-pronged process with operational enhancements, some automation, some smart capacity and efficiency and also making sure that price recovers it. So we really can't decompose all of that stuff at this point yet, but it is job one for us and it's a great problem to have. We're disappointed that we over swung last year.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker", "I was just wondering if we could get away from the fourth quarter for a second and just look out to 2015 and the first quarter and what you're seeing. I was just wondering if you can make some general comments about what you're seeing in the economy, maybe with a specific comment to what you're seeing from your corporate accounts who are energy\u00a0focused and if there is something you can fill us in about what you're seeing there.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, our exposure to the energy sector is not huge. There is not a tremendous amount of small package. But clearly all industries are having an impact over time with this low energy cost. On the procurement side, it will ripple through into reduced prices we hope for things like tires and some of our commodities. Clearly, the fuel surcharge changes our impact. We did mention that the UPS Freight and the LTL surcharges are a bit of a challenge, but we think in general the reduced fuel prices are good for the economy and will help certainly the U.S. continue to grow.", "I think trends so far in January -- certainly things look better than they did a year ago at this time because of the incredible disruption of all the snowstorms. Although those people in Detroit and Chicago right now may not be feeling that way. So we feel pretty good in general. I know, Jim, around the globe anyway, the Chinese New Year is a little later than normal. Maybe you could talk a little bit about trade flows and anything you guys are seeing.", "Jim Barber", "Well I think it's just as you said. We're about where we thought we would be and of course, year-over-year it's different because of weather and some other options. I think the port delays are presenting some unique trade patterns. I think generally though, since that port delay is heavy into the oceanside of the supply chains that really presents some challenges for our customers. We've been at it for a year now actually. We started last February 2014 with webinars with all of our folks and customers to give them solutions and some of that you've seen appear in Myron's side of the business when it actually gets into -- because you've got to get into the port, through the port and out of the port and that's where our network provides some really good options. So I would say the port would be the big one and the wildcard here going forward as it moves from freight off the ocean, not so much into the air, but other surface modes as it appears in the U.S. side of the business.", "David Abney", "Just a couple things on the economy. one is things seem to be continuing to be going up or getting slowly better in the U.S. Unemployment rates are getting much down, very close to prerecession rates and consumer confidence is increasing and it's one of the reasons that we believe that our revenue is going to continue to grow and grow at a good pace in this year in the U.S. In Europe, of course, there's a lot of concern about the economy there, but our results have been and continue to be much better than we're seeing from an economic standpoint. Jim, could you talk a little bit about the transborder in Europe and the success we've seen there?", "Jim Barber", "Sure. As we know, the transborder network, we've talked about it many times on the previous calls it continues to drive our growth. You've seen that in the export numbers. Kurt mentioned about a year ago we would continue to reinvest in Europe, his number at that time was about $1 billion. We actually have sized it for the next five years. It's actually above that. We won't get to the specific numbers because there's changes, but it's above $1 billion and we believe that investment in essentially the Western side of the European operations, A, is needed, but, B, can bend that cost curve as we talked about it back to some of the days where it was at its best. So we would continue to do that.", "The other wildcard I would mention at the same time though, David is I think the strength of the dollar will have implications going forward that we're going to have to watch as trade patterns move around that, so that would be another wildcard, but we're happy with Europe and its continued growth for the business.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben Hartford", "Jim, maybe if we could just continue down that path and focus on international freight forwarding for a moment. There was some acknowledged weakness this quarter. I would be interested in your perspective on the yield dynamics in the fourth quarter and how you see that playing out in 2015. It seems as though there is a desire for some more yield discipline in that space, whether that comes through or not, I would be interested in your take. And then also if you could include your perspective on some of the attempted changes from the air freight carriers to comingle fuel surcharge with base rates and what effect that might have for 2015 as well that would be helpful. Thanks.", "Jim Barber", "Sure. I appreciate it. So if you look at our forwarding unit like many, we've got the ocean product, we've got the surface stuff; we've got the air products. Our North American operation, we continue to see it grow and do very nicely for us. Ocean was a turnaround story for the last five years. It continues to do really well for UPS and our customers and bring differentiated solutions to them. The air freight issue for us, you might have heard me say a couple times previously that we had some overexposure to some verticals around military and so forth.", "At this point, I think it's all about the mix of our air freight product. We're still heavily concentrated in some of the enterprise segments of the business. We believe we've got capacity going forward to extend that product into the middle market in a different way and change the mix and the structure, we will do that. You would see that in some of our guidance going forward with respect to a bit of a slower growth and so we'll manage that yield and the kilo growth which you've seen really good growth over the last couple years, but we believe it's time for us to shift.", "Your second question really got at this issue of fuel and the mixing of that into transportation. In fact, it's already started to happen with a dip in the oil. We've got some different looks at that. Obviously each organization has to deal with that and how they see that, but yes that is happening in the market right now with the concept of trying to split that apart in a different way and capture that dropping oil price. We have some solutions and some strategies to make sure that we do that on an equitable basis, but right now as we move out in the first part of the year, our strategy remains as I just walked you through and we will obviously have to deal with the fuel dip going forward, but we feel like we've got good controls in place to do that.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger", "I'm kind of pulling us back into peak on U.S. Domestic. Obviously, you're going to try a lot on the yield side going into 2015. I'm just curious on the cost side. There is so much opportunity and you're talking of structurally higher costs and sounding very conservative, but with driving density, SurePost Redirect now feeling like maybe the pendulum has swung a little bit to the other side on overtime and training. It seems like there is a lot of opportunity, I guess Myron, perhaps for you, is that something that you're going to be conservative and be cautious and protect brand again in 2015 may be planning for 2016 or is there real opportunity there and we should potentially view some conservatism in that guidance? Thanks.", "David Abney", "Let me just kick that off with our long term initiatives that we've talked about are certainly going to be very important to us over the next three to five years and so we're going to continue to bend this cost curve. We're going to continue to use technology and accelerate ORION deployment and our automation. All of those will help us from a long term perspective and we're going to continue to use other operational technology. But there are some real specific things that we need to do this year to reduce our costs and Myron, why don't you review some of the specifics.", "Myron Gray", "Earlier and my statement reflected on Black Friday operations, but certainly there are additional things that we'll certainly do and one is certainly not to err so much on the side of being cautious. In certain locations where we probably brought helpers on too early during peak, we obviously drove up our contract carrier costs by going out and securing contract carriers earlier in peak and paid a premium for them. We won't do that moving forward next year. We obviously -- also in some cases drove our driver paid day too low and added too many drivers. We'll have a tighter dispatch this year and we'll seek to have driver paid days that resemble peaks of the past.", "And we've also made some significant progress working with our customers on forecasting and as we get additional visibility tools, we can tighten our dispatch on a daily basis. However, peak does continue to be more complex and it will require that we run a tight dispatch. So we'll certainly plan to do that and make the obvious cost improvements that we can while we continue to invest in hub modernization and show that these peak operations that we have won't drive so much training and associated costs with them, but we will operate much tighter this year in 2015.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Tom Kim", "Staying on the topic of peak season, what seems to be -- over the last few years what we can easily derive is the fact that predicting demand around the peak season is obviously difficult and you and the shippers can try to influence the timing of shipping, but I would think that demand will remain uncertain which leads me to think that there probably should be more focus on just controlling your capacity and your cost and I guess what's missing in today's conversation is your willingness to simply walk away from business and more specifically I'm wondering like how are you thinking about setting volume caps? Thank you.", "David Abney", "I will start that out and then hand it over to Alan. But the control tower absolutely did what you're talking about during the very peak moments. Now the purpose of it wasn't to see how much volume we can turn away. The purpose was how we could work with customers to maybe change the timing, maybe change the operating plan so that we could handle their needs. We also though made it very clear especially on peak days through this control tower that we would not be able to take additional volume and we had good cooperation from our customers from that. So Alan, do you want to talk a little more?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, look I mean, we're always going to have a max capacity of what we can handle and we certainly need to manage to that considering obviously the revenue and cost and profitability implications. But like Myron said, we've come a long way this past year in really working with our top shippers to coordinate our planning activities to understand how much volume they were going to have and we came to mutual agreements on that. We will do even more of that next year and we're certainly going to be looking at our capacity, but also looking at the revenue cost and P&L implications going forward understanding that we never want to turn business away if we don't have to.", "Tom Kim", "I guess I'm just a little bit confused because on the last call Myron had talked about being able to adjust capacity if the demand expectations were optimistic and I'm just wondering what had sort of gone wrong there, what was missed given that the control tower was intended to foresee how volumes were going to be shaping up and then adjusting around that. So if you could just help flesh that out a little bit, that would be helpful. Thanks.", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, I think the big issue is just that the demand has become much more spiky at the very beginning of peak and at the very end. And so forecast aside, the shape of demand around the cyber weekend and then the weekend before Christmas was the big spikes and there just wasn't as much needed in that flat period.", "David Abney", "And we did increase customer collaboration and made a lot of improvements when it comes to forecasting. That is something that we still though will need to continue to work with our customers on.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Both this morning and at the recent investor meeting, we've heard about UPS's commitment to investing in Europe. How would you characterize the current B2C growth in Europe, maybe what's the proportion of B2C in the most recent period? And then more importantly how applicable are the learnings from the U.S. peak season challenges in avoiding similar margin crunches in Europe?", "Jim Barber", "So I would say this. Obviously the business, as you can see is smaller relative to the U.S. and more disperse, but the same patterns actually exist internationally as they do in the U.S. It depends on what country you're in. I would tell you that the expansion of our Cologne operation has provided us great ability to move it transborder, but a lot of this does move domestically. I think you would have seen outside the U.S. some of our local competitors actually didn't make it through this peak. They actually as they say, kind of -- the investors pulled back on them. In the UK we had some issues and we think that our operating model does in fact with a combination of the Access Points and what we're looking at going forward give us the ability internationally to give our consumers choice on how they want this delivered at the right value proposition that in fact in the years to come may present some opportunities back in the U.S. And you're starting to see that with Myron rolling out Access Points, we're bringing My Choice to International. So it's a fee back-and-forth and we like where we're in that and Europe is our probably best market to prove that in the years to come.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "John Barnes", "I hear your commentary around customer collaboration and I recognize the need to have those conversations, but if I'm looking at this incredible surge in volume a couple of times year and especially around peak season and there is only a couple of networks in this country that can handle that level of surge. I'm trying to understand why there has to be this level of collaboration. I mean the e-commerce revolution has taught us anything, its people want a lot and they don't want to pay a lot for it. So it seems to me like there is always going to be this give-and-take and if there is only a couple of networks and you're in what is essentially a duopoly situation, why not be more aggressive? Why does this have to take multiple years? Why can't this be a much more aggressive focus on one getting paid for what you're offering?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Yes, John, I think certainly that is our focus. We may disagree on the speed and the intensity of it. This is a competitive market. It's not a duopoly, there are multiple players. Part of the value we create, part of why we extract such great returns is the long term success we help our customers get to. So it is a balancing act of trying to milk every dollar out of a couple of days versus creating a sustainable and profitable business year-round and that's the balancing act we're heading towards.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of David Campbell with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.", "David Campbell", "Kurt, you mentioned in your presentation that you were estimating in 2015 a 5% increase in domestic packages, I think that's what you said. I just wondered in general it doesn't seem to reflect the fact that we have $50 oil and the possibility that we're going to get faster growth, not less growth. I'm just curious as to is the 4% growth estimate based on what you see today or does it reflect a longer-term benefit from lower oil prices? Just how does that all work out?", "Kurt Kuehn", "Well David, we're looking at about a 4% volume level and certainly there is some range in that number depending on how the economy goes. We did have a very strong year last year and we're cycling across some fairly large wins. There is also some issue that we may be a little more selective in volume. Clearly, it's the flip side of the revenue management initiative. So we think our guidance reflects both an improving economy and also a prudent growth path. So we think that's certainly a number that's in excess of GDP growth and that there may be more volume out there, but we will be somewhat selective especially if we're not appropriately compensated for it.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our Q&A today. I now turn the conference back to your host, Joe Wilkins. Please go ahead.", "Joe Wilkins", "Thank you, Brad. I appreciate it. And with that, I will turn it over to David for closing comments.", "David Abney", "All right, thanks, Joe. So yes, we do feel we have customers back onboard after providing a great service during peak. The financial results will improve as we take the steps to lower the cost curve and adjust pricing where necessary.", "The long term growth strategy for all of our business units that we laid out in November remains intact and will provide great opportunities for UPS in the future. UPS has always been a good place for investors, for customers, for employees and we certainly expect that to continue.

My name is Steven, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note we will take only one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkins, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Joe Wilkins - Investor Relations Officer", "Good morning, and welcome to the UPS second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K and 2015 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "As a reminder, in the second quarter last year UPS completed the transfer of post-retirement liabilities for certain Teamster employees to defined contribution Healthcare plans. As a result, the company recorded an after-tax charge of $665 million, reducing second quarter 2014 diluted earnings per share by $0.72. In our remarks today, all quarterly and full-year comments and comparisons will refer to 2014 adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS' free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.", "The webcast of today's call along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. And just as a reminder, please ask only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. Thanks for your cooperation.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to David.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and welcome. We're pleased to share results of another solid quarter and I want to thank the UPS team for their efforts. This is the second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, which demonstrates we are successfully executing and generating improved performance.", "UPS grew operating profits and expanded margins across all three segments. In the U.S., we remain focused on growing the business, effective revenue management and delivering operational improvements. Although, the economy slowed somewhat we made progress on executing our plan.", "Our International segment continues to have positive momentum with our operating profit, up more than 17% primarily led by strong results in Europe. Our ongoing investments and integrated operating model are driving increased customer demand around the world.", "Our Supply Chain & Freight segment also had a solid increase in operating profit. The result was led by Forwarding as it continues to pursue a disciplined pricing strategy across key trade lanes. Clearly, we're making good progress this year. We're highly focused on executing our strategy to create unmatched value for UPS customers and UPS shareholders. We will accomplish this by continuing to build on the strategies guiding our business. They are: expanding our network capacity; improving operational efficiency; focusing on high-growth markets; and delivering industry-specific solutions.", "In the area of expanded network capacity, we made key announcements during the quarter. In Germany, we doubled the capacity of the UPS hub in Nuremberg. This automated facility is ideally situated to link Eastern and Western European trade lanes.", "We announced an expansion of UPS Worldwide Express Freight service, adding five emerging markets in Latin America and three in Europe. This guaranteed services designed for urgent, high-value and heavyweight international shipments.", "In another high-growth market, UPS implemented several enhancements throughout Asia to improve service coverage and network speed. The moves accelerated intra-Asia transit times by up to one full day connecting 41 key markets. These improvements will position UPS to further capitalize on the fast-growing intra-Asia marketplace.", "We continued to make good progress expanding UPS industry-specific solutions. To broaden our global Healthcare network, we announced two new facilities in the Netherlands. These new sites add capacity and simplify customer access to our global distribution network.", "We also opened an automated distribution facility for Pratt & Whitney in New Hampshire. This facility is a great example of how we collaborate with Aerospace companies by offering specialized solutions that provide them with competitive advantages, while these investments help UPS grow strategic acquisitions, speed the implementation of new capabilities across our global network.", "In fact, UPS Capital recently acquired two specialized high-value logistics companies, Parcel Pro and IPS. They enhance our global small package network for secure shipment and insurance solutions for high-value goods in Europe, Asia and the U.S.", "Another great example of acquiring capabilities in one region and implementing them globally is our purchase of Kiala, which we have referenced in the past. We've refined and improved this unique e-commerce delivery solution and launched it globally as the UPS Access Point.", "In the U.S., we had very positive results in five initial markets. Today, I'm excited to announce we are accelerating the rollout of this delivery option to more than 100 U.S. cities. By year-end, we'll have more than 8,000 locations in the U.S. and more than 22,000 globally.", "The UPS Access Points location provide a convenient and secure alternative to home delivery in order to enhance the e-commerce delivery experience for consumers. This is an important part of our strategy to offer unique customer solutions and improve e-commerce profitability.", "Before I turn it over to Richard, I would like to applaud the passage of the U.S. Trade Promotion Authority bill. TPA will help facilitate trade agreements that provide growth opportunities for UPS and our customers. We all know that trade is vital to the U.S. economy, supporting global growth and spurring job creation.", "I understand the negotiators are making headway on the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. We urge them to resolve final outstanding differences and for the U.S. Congress to approve the agreement. We also encourage negotiators to make progress on TTIP, another critical agreement that will enable international trade.", "To summarize, I'm pleased to say that we're on track with our earnings growth and pace of investment. Based on our recent performance, we fully expect to attain the higher end of our guidance range. Our progress to-date, especially in the International segment, makes us confident in our strategic direction and four-year plan.", "Richard will now take you through the details.", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Thanks, David, and good morning. I'm glad you could all join us this morning. It's great to speak with you on my first official earnings call.", "I've had the opportunity to meet many of you, the analysts and investors, who know our company so well. Those meetings gave me a better appreciation for the market perspective on UPS as an investment. I heard the importance of execution in the current business model as well is looking for future opportunities to grow this business and create value. Your open and honest feedback is appreciated by me and it will be useful as we move this great company forward.", "Now, let's turn to the second quarter results. UPS delivered better-than-expected results. The International continues to show strong momentum with key initiatives around the world contributing to our success, especially in Europe.", "The U.S. Domestic business is on track with its revenue management and efficiency gains; however, we are seeing some softening in the economy. Our Supply Chain & Freight results were lifted by improvements in the Forwarding unit. Market pricing and customer mix drove better-than-expected results. Together the segments produced earnings per share growth of 12%.", "Turning our attention more specifically to the U.S. Domestic segment, where operating profits increased to $1.2 billion. The operating margin expanded to 13.6% as a result of the pricing initiatives and productivity improvements from technology implementations such as ORION that we've talked about in the past.", "Packages per day were up 1.8%, driven by a 15% increase in Deferred Air products and UPS SurePost growth of over 8%. On the other hand, total average daily volume comparisons were lowered by 50 basis points versus last year due to a second quarter benefit in 2014 for a large catalog shipment.", "This year, UPS experienced balanced commercial and residential growth. The pace of B2C expansion continued slowing, while B2B gains were due to omni-channel and return services in the retail sector.", "Reported yields were flat with last year as solid base rate increases were offset by the product mix changes and more importantly, about a 300 basis point decline in fuel surcharge revenues.", "Turning to International, and this is where the segment set a new high in second quarter operating profit, our profit rising more than 17%. Our results are due to a balanced approach, a balance of export shipment growth, network efficiency gains and a strong focus on revenue management initiatives. These areas also drove significant expansion of our operating margin, but keep in mind, it was magnified by the weakening of the non-U.S. currencies.", "Looking at the top line in this segment, International revenue adjusted for currency increased 1.5% over the prior year. I've received a lot of positive feedback on the transparency of the new currency schedules we added last quarter. We kept the schedules that showed the impact of currency changes on our reported revenue.", "Revenue management initiatives have boosted base rates across the globe. However, there is about a 350 basis point headwind due to lower fuel surcharges in 2015. Looking at yields, there is some impact on shift of products as reported revenue per piece on a currency adjusted basis decreased 2.4%. Although the biggest impact to reported yields is due to fuel surcharges, if we factor out fuel, revenue per piece was slightly positive.", "The International success is due to robust export volume growth that remains strong at 5.5% growth driven by an intra-Europe shipment growth of over 8.5%. The strength of the U.S. dollar contributed to greater U.S. import shipments primarily from Europe, while exports out of the U.S. were down slightly as the dollar increased in value.", "Looking at the Supply Chain & Freight segment, operating profit jumped 18% to $207 million and margins expanded to over 9%, driven primarily by the improvements in the Forwarding unit. The Forwarding unit is executing a disciplined revenue management strategy focused on profitable trade lane growth.", "As a result, revenue declined as certain lower yielding contracts were not renewed. Market conditions in the International Air Freight business allowed the unit to capitalize as buy rates dropped quickly, providing improved pricing spreads during the quarter. Operating profit increased and margin expanded to high-single digits.", "The distribution unit continues to expand its industry-specific solutions in order to win more and win faster, opening new facilities around the world like the ones David mentioned earlier. Revenue growth was led by Mail Services, Healthcare and Aerospace gains.", "UPS Freight revenue declined 2.5%, primarily due to lower fuel surcharges and a drop in the LTL tonnage. Pricing discipline in the unit was evident as we saw LTL revenue per hundredweight increase 1.4%.", "Now let's turn and talk about our cash position. For the six months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow, after reinvesting in the business with capital expenditures of about $1 billion. In terms of shareholder distributions so far this year, UPS has paid $1.3 billion in dividends, an increase of 9% per share. We've also repurchased more than 13.5 million shares for just under $1.4 billion. Note that our second quarter tax rate decreased to 34.5%, primarily due to a one-time tax credit.", "Now let's turn and discuss our guidance for the rest of the year. Total company first-half results came in a little better than anticipated, primarily due to the improved International performance. As we previously guided, third-quarter earnings per share is expected to be up modestly due to tough comparisons with the same period last year. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter should be slightly above our guidance range.", "Now let's turn and talk about the individual units. In the U.S., we expect Domestic volume to increase between 2% and 3%, as a result of the slowing pace of growth in the economy. Revenue should grow at a slightly faster pace as base rate pricing remains strong. However, lower fuel surcharges will continue to weigh on the reported yields.", "U.S. Domestic operating profit in the third quarter should be flat with last year. It's due to the tough comparisons created by lower workers' compensation cost in 2014. Fourth quarter operating profit is anticipated to grow in the low-double digits. Full-year operating guidance remains unchanged at 5% to 9%.", "In the International segment, we expect to see positive momentum continue in the second half of the year with operating profits at the high end of our 6% to 12% range. Revenue growth in International will continue to be challenged by currency changes and lower fuel surcharge revenues. We are confident of the International guidance, because of our balanced approach of growing the business, creating network efficiencies and strong revenue management initiatives we have implemented.", "In Supply Chain & Freight groups, second-half operating margins are predicted to continue to be around 9%. Top line growth will be muted in Supply Chain & Freight as the Forwarding unit continues to implement their initiatives and change their customer mix.", "To summarize the quarter's results, positive progress is being made across all segments of our business. All segments improved profitability and margins. The investments we are making in new capacity and capabilities are starting to pay dividends.", "We are successfully executing our strategy today, while we continue to identify both organic and new accretive growth opportunities for the future. The confidence we have in meeting those objectives is demonstrated by our move to the higher end of the guidance. Thank you.", "Now, I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking the question. I'm just wanting to talk a little bit on the domestic side with the comments of things slowing a little bit. One, is that relative to just expectations for the start of the year or is something really going on currently? And how do you disassociate that from whether any of your other customers might be doing a little bit more themselves and if that's taken an impact? And if indeed you believe that slowness to continue for the year, will that hurt any of your expectations going into peak season in terms of the benefits on profitability, particularly expectations for greater route density both real and synthetic?", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. This is David. That is a heck of a question. And I will start the answer and then I'll hand it over to Alan. He can talk a little bit about it from a customer standpoint. But to get to the economy, recent economic news has just been mixed and it's caused us to be cautious. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar and I think this impending rate hike by the Fed appears to be holding back some U.S. growth.", "If you just look at in January, the GDP forecast we thought was going to be about 3.1%. Now, the thinking in July is about 2.3%, so let's say, a pretty significant decrease. Retail has been uneven and we saw it soften a little bit in June. And so, that's the reason that we're cautious. Obviously, we had a good first quarter, a good second quarter, but a little bit cautious about the U.S. economy. Alan, you want to talk a little bit about it from a customer standpoint?", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah, Nate, a couple of things to keep in mind. Remember back in the second quarter of 2014, we've got some tough comps. We had some of our best Ground growth in 2014 for the second quarter, up above 8% growth. So, when you look at the two-year growth comparison, we're up about 9% versus 2Q 2013. Also, we had a very large catalog shipment last year that was about a 50 basis point positive impact on the second quarter last year.", "While the overall growth issue was just shy of 2%, we've had some really strong Deferred Air growth at 14% and even with lapping some 60% year-over-year growth on SurePost, for the first half of 2014 we still had excellent SurePost growth at 8%. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Yes, good morning. Wanted to ask you on the pricing side and just I guess a question on how that came through in the numbers for Ground yield. I know there was fuel surcharge impact, but if I look at Ground yields were up about 1%, 1.1% in second quarter, they were up 3.1% in first quarter. So, I don't know if you could give some color on why there is that deceleration and if the core price still looks pretty strong? And then in terms of any thoughts on peak season surcharge whether that's likely at this point or whether we should be cautious on our view on that? So, on the broader pricing front? Thank you.", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah. So, on the Ground you can see the RPP showing plus a little over 1%. And what you've got there is a fuel surcharge drag of a couple of hundred basis points that's putting a drag on that as well as the large customer versus small customer mix. And obviously, we're growing our SurePost faster than our Ground residential.", "And then you've also got the omni-channel there, where we've got some shorter zone. But, on the base rates, we are absolutely at the high-end of the 2% to 3% range and our tactics of creating value for customers along with the revenue management associated with the GRI, dim weight and other value-added asset stories are all working. And we're obviously very, very pleased with the yield.", "As far as peak goes, we're certainly focused on improving the residential profitability year-around. And like I said, we're at the higher end there, the 2% to 3%. And that's going to have an impact on residential and peak. And we are going to continue to address peak on a customer-by-customer basis, really understanding what their needs are, the value of the solutions and market conditions and price them accordingly.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, thanks. Maybe, Richard, this is probably directed to you since this is the first time at the helm for you at the call. On the heels of some of the recent industry news speculation with regard to your acquisition strategy, specifically targeting a large truck broker, I won't ask you to comment on that specifically; but maybe generally speaking, can you provide some context to your perspective on how you view the business from an acquisition standpoint? What are some targets or goals and really how do you view your industry-leading return on invested capital? And could your focus change a little bit to broaden the scale or opportunities as it relates to acquisitions going forward, some perspective there would be helpful?", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, Ben, this is David. I'll take the first part of that question. And as you accurately predicted, I'll turn it over to Richard. But really, first, when it comes to any rumors that may be out there, obviously, we can't respond to rumors as you know, and UPS does not discuss M&A activities just due to confidentiality and competitive reasons. But, getting back to the more general understanding of what we are looking for, it's really in three different areas.", "First is, what are new opportunities that would allow us to expand our portfolio and allow us to give additional value to our customers? We also look at geography, are there certain geographies that could strengthen our offering? And then third, we look at what capability does our network presently need that we don't have? And where there's an adjacent industry or whether it's a different service offering. So, that's in general, the way that we look at it. Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about the ROIC and our expectations?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure. So, when we think about the acquisitions, we look at not only how the business stands alone, but also as we integrate into our business what it does? And so, obviously, over time what happens with our acquisitions is that the ROIC becomes closer to the characteristics of the UPS ROIC as it expands the capabilities David talked about. And such as Kiala, where it started out as a standalone with a very small ROIC, and now its value to the UPS network is much greater. So, we look at it is growing it into the UPS network, also increases and is important to the acquisition \u2013 it takes on the attributes of our financial discipline as well. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning and thanks for your time. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to, obviously, we appreciate your confidence guiding toward the higher end of the range. It certainly seems that you're bucking the trends on global Air Freight trends; and frankly, indicators that we've been looking at had been deteriorating, so it's great to see you guys outperform there. And I know we've talked previously about how Europe is driving all of that. My question is around China. As you know, concerns around to that market have only increased recently with a market selloff. And as I think about your business, I believe, it's predominantly exposed to China exports and if that's fair, I'd certainly love to hear that affirmation. But, I am wondering to what extent you can provide color around your exposure to China imports and the domestic market, which obviously would be more impacted by a slower China. Thank you.", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International", "Tom, this is Jim. I'll pick that one up. I think, obviously, the last couple of days in the market have been unique, to say the least. I think we look at that, though, as really more of a domestic phenomenon as opposed to really aligning to our business.", "We still are firmly in the export-import business in China. Most recently, we're up about 5% to 6%, we continue to focus on the middle market. And so, we continue to be in China for the long-term. So, really those factors that are going on as they moved to more of a domestic GDP consumption, we have to keep an eye on it, but our business is aligned to grow almost regardless of that through the import-export and the Supply Chain and Forwarding business. So, that's the kind of what we look at it right now.", "Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. Can you dig into the comments on the slowing B2C just a little bit, maybe flesh that out? Or is that a slowing overall market? Are you losing volumes to other modes? And I guess if you compound that with your thoughts on a slowing economy, do you now need to get out ahead of this and I don't know, cut costs, eliminate trade lanes, lower CapEx, is there anything you need to react at this point? But, I guess, primarily thoughts on the commentary around the slowing B2C? Thanks.", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah, Ken, hey. This is Alan. I'll take that. We're certainly, we're about where we thought we would be. We think the economy was certainly slower for sure. The B2C pace, I think the secular trends are still in place; although, it is slow again, you've got to remember we had those tough comps from last year. I'd also say that, on the B2B side as a demonstration of e-commerce, the omni-channel and the returns are still very, very strong.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "This is David. Alan talked about the tough comps. You just have to look back and if you look at two years ago and compare what our volume is today, you actually see an increase of 9%. It's just that when you compare them to the comps of last year that you get a little bit different perspective. So, good question. Thank you. And, operator, we're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you and congratulations on a nice quarter, gentlemen. You've talked about UPS Forwarding benefiting from improved market conditions and customer mix. Maybe could you expand a little bit more upon the improved market conditions commentary? Is that more of a function of better buy rates? Or is that in conjunction with maybe a pickup in volume? Just maybe a little more color around those improved market conditions you're seeing in Forwarding. Thank you.", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International", "Okay, Kevin. It's Jim. So, first let me start with the overall Forwarding results are really balanced. I'll get to the IAS specific in a second. But, when you look at the North America Freight network, ocean brokerage, NIF, they all had really solid quarters for us. We've told you guys back in 2014, we'd come into this with a very focused go-to-market strategy of the right tonnage, the right customers, and our balanced network. We did that.", "With specifics to the market right now, what's going on is from the way we see it, we got about 12% more capacity in the market than we thought. What that does is drop, obviously, the buy rates and it opens it up a bit. We think that will last about three more months, maybe two-and-a-half months as we come up into the retail peak season.", "At that point, we'll continue to adjust, but we did get some tailwinds. I would say, the majority of the results are really kind of because of the right focus, the right customers and the right tonnage in the network, the balance of that is some tailwinds on the market.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys and thanks for taking a question. So, if we look at the leverage that UPS is getting in International, can you help us to understand what's driving the upside? I'm specifically trying to figure out, if it's the benefits from maybe better profitability in the longer haul, sort of cross-ocean package business? Or maybe you guys are just getting a lot more leverage on the high rates of intra-European growth than maybe would have expected? Just trying to sort of look at it from the inside out. Are you getting better growth out of the cross-ocean business or more intra-European?", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International", "Yes. I'll start with that. So, let me just say this. We talk a lot about Europe, but we also over the last year-and-a-half have really done some good work in Asia as well, largely around our intra-Asia network. David made some of those references in the opening comments. But, we really had to kind of get that intra-Asia network built up, after we built it to the right place and the team's done a great job.", "Europe continues to do very well. So, really, the Asia-Pacific that has intra-Asia and the trunks back to Europe and U.S. are performing very nicely. Europe, as we've said, it's about a balanced mix of product mix, yield mix, and then cost management on the back of the capital that we've talked about and putting an extra $1 billion of capital into that part of the UPS network. So, it's really a combination of those two.", "And then, I would say, at the same time, I would ask you not to lose sight of, as these results come out, we're also taking advantage of actually investing in emerging markets and continuing to expand as we said in opening comments, in some of the other capabilities. So, we're kind of blending it all together and that's kind of what you see in the bottom line results.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know, we do have, we do see a lot of strong momentum in our International business. And one of the key factors is definitely the pan-European network that we put in place maybe a few years before its time, before the market started shifting to a pan-European inventory replacement model. And now that that transition is happening, we've just got the right network in the right place, at the right time. And Jim and his team's just doing an excellent job with it. Thank you. And next question, please, operator?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could discuss the impact of fuel and lower buy rates in the Forwarding division that you saw on the purchase transportation expense line item. It looked like there was a more pronounced sequential decline as a percent of sales than the historical average. So, any color that you could provide with respect to this and maybe how to think about it going forward. Thank you.", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "So, I think I'll start by talking about the impact of fuel in total and then I'll turn it over to Jim to talk a little bit about the Forwarding group specifically. When we look at the total company and adjust for fuel, we're talking about a growth rate of about 1.5% versus what's reported. So, fuel this quarter had the biggest year-over-year change that we expect or that we've had in 2015. So, because of the large 300 basis points in Ground and 350 basis point difference in Air, it had a big impact on reported revenue and you see that in the revenue number.", "In fact, it's worth mentioning that we're pretty happy with where our revenue growth has been, but it's being masked by both fuel and currency. Those two combined would take revenue growth to almost 4%. So, there's something around the neighborhood of $700 million difference in reported revenue versus the commodities. Jim, why don't you talk about the Forwarding?", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International", "Yeah, Allison, the only thing I would remind you and come on the back of that was what I just mentioned a minute ago, and that is that we come at this with a very targeted approach. Last year, we grew effectively tonnage almost double-digits quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter, which obviously hits the top line. This one has been much more muted. It's about flat tonnage, year-over-year. But the product mix and the tonnage we're bringing in, you can see how it affects the bottom line as well.", "And as I said, or we talked about, that buy rate, we figure is down about 7% where we thought it would be coming into the year. That translates also to the bottom line and I've spoken how we see that going forward. So, that's kind of how we manage the results.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to touch a little bit on the guidance, specifically around the fourth quarter as you expect sort of a bit of a ramp back up to low-double digits on the domestic side. I guess when you think about sort of e-commerce customers and preparing for the peak season, you have about four months to go. I guess, how far through the process are you in terms of talking to customers, getting them prepared for what they might need to do from both an operational perspective as well as sort of a pricing perspective, as you're at this point in the game? I just want to get a sense of sort of how far you are through that process, maybe what else needs to be done as you go through the next four months in advance of peak? Thank you.", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah. This is Alan. Our peak season planning for 2015 started right after peak 2014. So, we've been having discussions with our customers on the solutions that we need to put in place, the capacity planning, the visibility we need, the forecasting, and so on and so forth. So, this is an ongoing process that happens throughout the year. We don't discuss the individual customer pricing, but we do have comprehensive peak pricing initiatives underway to increase revenue from the customers that surge and ultimately drive significantly greater cost at peak.", "And this solutioning and pricing is really separate and distinct from our year-around revenue management and solutioning. And it's helping us better align our revenue with our cost. And now maybe, Myron, you want to talk a little bit about what we're doing on the operations side?", "Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President", "So, Chris, this is Myron. We're certainly on plan as it pertains to operations. Earlier Alan alluded to Access Points, so we're going to deploy them in over 100 cities and we'll have over 8,000 Access Points by the end of the year. It's a win for the customer, for the companies, and certainly for UPS as we'll be able to drive delivery density. Along with that, we'll continue to deploy operational technology at a faster pace. We'll have over 70% of our drivers deployed on ORION by the end of year.", "There are 10 projects that we certainly are addressing that either allude to hub modernization, automation or expanded capacity. And our flow-through at the end of peak season will be enhanced by over 6%. And then we're also going to, as I've alluded to before, tighten up operations. We'll extend our drivers' delivery day a bit and will not use as many drivers as we've used in the past to lower our costs. So, we're on plan and we're pleased with where we are today.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "This is David. Everyone in our organization is focused on making sure that we have a good peak for investors, customers, and employees. And we absolutely felt like that we're on track and where we need to be at this time. And we're focused on where we need to go between now and peak. So, thank you for the question.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, thank you. Hey, just to follow-up on that, I mean, you mentioned capacity planning, I know last year you made a concerted effort to over-resource the network for a period of time to ensure the service kind of came through. How do you balance the capacity planning with some of the comments you've just made on maybe seeing some slowing in B2C, some signs that may be the economy is a little softer, retail has obviously been a mixed message? How are you walking through this process of kind of figuring out that capacity planning, resource planning when you've got this backdrop that maybe is a little softer than you anticipated?", "Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President", "So, as Alan alluded to earlier, we've been collaborating with our customers since the beginning of the year and this is much even earlier than what we've done in the past. So, we're certainly going to stay close to what their projections are and we'll flex the system based on what we believe the volume pinch points may be.", "I also alluded to the projects that we have in place this year to expand capacity and if you'll remember last year, our pinch points were network-related and not delivery-related. So, we'll flex our drivers based on the capacity that we see and we believe that these expansion and capacity projects that we have in place will improve our flow through to the point that we can control our costs. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on the competitive landscape in the U.S. Ground segment. Given the Postal Service wants to become a bigger player with some of the larger e-commerce shippers and you're seeing certainly a more competitive dynamic among the regional players out there, what are you seeing as you try to implement these above-trend pricing increases? And are you seeing any disruptors in the marketplace given a more sluggish domestic economy?", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah. The U.S. market has always been competitive, but I would tell you that where we're seeing the growth right now in the e-commerce area, nobody has a better solution out there than UPS with our e-commerce ecosystem, whether it's omni-channel or synchronized delivery solutions, returns, our SurePost and SurePost Redirect, UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point that Myron talked about. So, we're real confident in our ability to achieve our plans from both a top and bottom-line perspective.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And one of the reasons that we're so confident, and this is David, is that the unique solutions that we continue to focus on that are going to help us not only during peak season, but throughout the year to remain competitive and to provide the value to our customers that are looking for Access Points, I think, is a great example that we get the benefits during the year. And this is something that started on an acquisition that we did a few years ago in Europe and now we're implementing it across the U.S. in over 100 cities. And these Access Points combined with UPS My Choice just gives us a real differentiator to offer the marketplace. So, thank you for the question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered so let me follow-up more on the investment side. You're now rolling out Access Point, you had accelerated ORION, you're seeing a little bit of a softer patch domestically on the retail side. Have you given any thought to the capital spending for the next one to two years?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Jeff, this is Richard, thanks for the question. You know when we think about investing in our network, we think about the long-term benefits and we think it's important that we continue to manage this network and the highly integrated parts of the network for the long term. And so, as we look at what's happening with volume, there might be little tweaks; but overall, we're adding capabilities and enhancements that are going to help our customers for the long term. Thank you.", "Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks very much. Over in the Supply Chain & Freight category, I'm just curious, could you elaborate a little bit on the Mail Services with distribution. And then as a follow-up, just Freight pricing in Freight if there's a little bit of slowing growth in the market, what you can do there? Thanks.", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International", "Yes, Scott, it's Jim. The Mail Services, as most of these products are designed to do is provide a solution to a customer that the other products in the portfolio don't. Obviously, it's, if you will, an asset-light business that we're glad we're in it. We'll continue to invest in it the right way.", "We've got a lot of customers that are using all of our products. And so, it's not one product versus the other. But obviously, we have the SurePost on the other side as well as Mail Innovations. But, it's a product that we are glad to be in and we plan to continue to invest in it and it just complements all the other products that we have for our customers.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "From our Supply Chain & Freight perspective overall, we are seeing good growth and had a good quarter. And we've got a good focus and expect that we will continue to see good results. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the better quarter here. Richard, I want to come back to a near-term question, because I think it's important here, but can you comment on the FX impact in International's quarter? Because it would seem to me that if you're translating foreign currency into a shorter dollar, it would actually be negative on earnings. So, is there some hedge impact that we should be thinking about? And if I extrapolate your guidance in the back half of the year, it sounds like you're talking for a sequential deceleration in International margins. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Yeah. So, let's first talk about currency, because currency really has an impact on the top line and the bottom line for UPS. On the top line, obviously, there's lower reported revenue as the dollar strengthened. And in the schedule, I had referenced earlier, there's about $320 million less revenue.", "On the bottom line, our hedges are protecting our profits, not creating profits, and the hedge allowed us to make sure our profit levels stayed the same. But, we did have about a $15 million drag for the unhedged currency and that's part of that unhedged currency drag that we talked about for the year. It had a minimal impact; but at the same time, there are currencies that are moving very quickly and the exposures aren't large enough for us to take a position on those. What was the second question?", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The second question was about the second half of the year.", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Okay. And on the second half of the year, our guidance really is at the higher end of our, where we expect it to be and it's really driven by the fourth quarter that you mentioned; but in the third quarter, there's some tough year-over-year comps.", "In the third quarter, we had a very high earnings per share, 14%. We talked about the volume that drove that and there were some wage deflation productivity improvements and we expect some of that to continue, but there was also a true-up of workers' comp with a credit and we just don't think the credit will be quite as large in the third quarter. And so, when you put them together, we're growing our profits in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we expect to hit the high end of our guidance.", "Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey. Thanks guys, good morning. So, just wanted to follow-up on a couple of items with you, Richard. The currency hedge impact that you talked about in the second quarter, how should we think about that hedge benefit in third quarter and fourth quarter and then into 2016? And then also on the fuel side, you gave good color on the revenue impact. Can you just help us think about the net impact on profitability for each of the segments in the quarter?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure. First, we'll talk about the currency hedge. One of the things we talked about in previous calls as well is that we took a multiyear approach to the hedge. We really did that as the currency was at the $1.35, $1.33 range. So, we have coverage on the currency all the way through the end of 2016. And because of that we don't think there's an impact that you should be thinking about on that.", "In terms of the fuel and the net fuel, when you think about fuel there's a lot of ups and downs, but the bottom line is it's almost neutral to the profit line. There is a slight drag in the domestic in the second quarter, but it's not enough to really talk about at this point. But overall, our fuel surcharge is meant to be a natural offset to the changing volatility of fuel prices, so that it's taken into account.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "All right. Helpful. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Kelly A. Dougherty - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I know there's been a lot of discussion about slowing B2C growth, so I'm just curious if you can estimate for us how much of the business is industrial-related versus consumer-driven. And I'm pretty sure it's pretty different within the segment so any comments on that. And then maybe just a big picture insight into how you see industrial versus consumer parts of the economy moving, and maybe how you might have to make some adjustments to the network, if that's changed since you first put out the operating plan for this year.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. I'll take the second part of the question about the economy and then turn it over to Alan. So, we have talked about seeing B2C, the pace slow down just a little bit. We don't at all want to leave people, though, with the impression that B2C is not going to continue to grow. And it is, but just the pace of growth has slowed just a little bit.", "And the other part from the industrial, the manufacturing side, we've seen four quarters of increase from the manufacturing sector; but really this quarter, we saw that, I was going to call it even, but it was just a slight decrease. So, that's one of the reasons that we're a little cautious about the remainder of the year in the U.S. We just want to see if the manufacturing sector rebounds. I'll turn it over to Alan for the first part of your question.", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah. Kelly, really the split right now in the U.S. is about 45% B2C, 55% B2B. And like David said, the manufacturing and some other sectors that were related to B2B have slowed down a little bit. The B2B this quarter was primarily driven by retail with returns and omni-channel. Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes, good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit about UPS Freight. Shipments were flattish year- over-year, a little down probably reflecting the industrial economy that you just talked about there, David. But when I look at yield, adjusting for weight per shipment it looks like yield was down year-over-year unless something went on with average length of haul. Was average length of haul up, down? What was the impact there and what was kind of true pricing like in the LTL?", "Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President", "Good morning, David. This is Myron. Overall, as you know, the U.S. Freight market is down 1.5% to 2%. However, our base rates and bottom line continues to be supported by a disciplined strategy, which is our focus on the middle market. So, the average tonnage was down, but revenue per ton continued to actually grow because of rate actions that we're taking on some lower yielding customers. And we see it coming through in our business, so we're actually pleased with where we are.", "David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Where was average length of haul?", "Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President", "It's about the same.", "David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, thanks for taking the question. We heard a lot of talk a couple weeks ago with regard to July Black Friday events, and I was curious, if you could talk a little bit about how that volume, if we should be expecting any sort of meaningful impact in the third quarter? And could you talk about the performance during that kind of summer peak-type volumes and if there were any incremental resources that you added to the network?", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah, hey. This is Alan. Look, as we all know there was a number of retailers out there that had a number of similar events. And we're actually excited about this innovativeness that's going to continue with e-commerce. It obviously drives significant small package growth and redefines how business is done. And UPS will benefit and continue to benefit from those type of promotions.", "And certainly, our ability to develop the solutions that I talked about earlier with our e-commerce ecosystem gives us the ability to flex our integrated interoperable network to support those kind of promotions very cost-effectively.", "The last thing I'll say is that I think it's also a demonstration of the potential to drive and shift demand that there's going to be some definite new learnings from. For example, we've talked on prior calls about the U-shaped volume between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And certainly, if we can better level that working with our retailers, that's going to help out our retailers and UPS alike. Thanks.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Co. Please go ahead.", "David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.", "Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a good quarter. I just wanted to ask about the last six months. Someone mentioned I think that operating profit in the International operations would be up 15%; but I'm not sure, I got that right. Could you please clarify that for me?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure, this is Richard. What we have guided to for the next six months is that the operating profit in International would be at the high end of the range that we've given at 6% to 12%. And that's what we expected in the guidance and was in my talk.", "David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.", "And so that rate of growth is also in the last six months, 6% to 12%?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "That's right. At the high end of that range.", "David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Matt Troy of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.", "Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Yeah, thanks. I just wanted to ask a broader question. The same-day fulfillment market is one that's been receiving a lot of attention in the press. You've got Amazon launching in 14 major markets. Just wondering to the extent you could update us on your thoughts and your tests in the same-day market that would be extremely helpful. And what you might look at the market size as going forward.", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah, Matt, this is Alan. We've been in the same-day market for about 20 years on the B2B side with our Express Critical and Forward Stocking Location network primarily aligned to high-tech and Healthcare.", "As you know, there's a tremendous amount of innovation going on in the retail e-commerce space including same-day. And we all know why that is, is because retail is expected to grow four times the GDP. We saw an announcement this morning about one of the operators closing down their same-day operations. And quite frankly, I think we all know that the challenge is having a valid economic model for low-cost shipping offers.", "Currently, the same-day free e-commerce has challenges with consolidating density on single piece stock economics that create profitability issues. So, we continue to monitor the space and look for cost-effective solutions that are profitable that can serve the needs of our retailers.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Matt, this is David. Because of the time that most of these e-commerce orders are made which is later in the afternoon we're really seeing much more of a demand for giving our retailers, especially those with an omni-channel network, giving them late pick-ups and then giving them local delivery the next day. And we've seen a lot of interest there and that's part of our business is growing and we expect that that will continue to grow at a pretty rapid rate. Thanks for the question.", "Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could give us a brief overview of your existing truckload brokerage operation? And just a little color on the overall size, where you regionally are customer focused, the growth rates you've been able to achieve and your desire to gain scale a bit more quickly through acquisition? And ultimately, is this business more strategically important to UPS as part of the bundle you can offer customers or really is a way to drive greater line haul efficiencies in your parcel and LTL businesses?", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "This is David. I would talk about the full truckload brokerage, we do have an existing business that's part of our UPS Freight business. And we do have asset-light businesses today that are part of this broad portfolio.", "As far as speculating where we may or may not want to go with that business, especially as it may or may not be anything that I'd say would be tied to rumors that are out there, that's really as far as we can go, that we have an existing business. And we just like any other part of our business expect to grow that business. And thank you for your question. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference back over to our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Abney. Please go ahead, sir.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. I would just like to close with a couple of things. One, very pleased that all three of our business units met planned performance or exceeded it and led to the results that we got to talk about today. We are clearly moving in the right direction to achieve our year-long financial objectives. And we do see strong international momentum and we do have confidence that we're going to hit the upper end of our guidance range.

Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO, along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.", "Before we begin, I would like to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we will make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K and 2015 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS\u2019 Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Before we begin, I would like to make you aware of a few adjusting entries that impact our reported results. UPS recorded a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $79 million. The charge resulted from lower asset returns that were partially offset by higher discount rates. Investment returns on planned assets were negatively affected by the overall market performance. The impact of the shortfall was mostly offset by increased interest rates used to calculate the planned discount rate.", "In the prior year period, the company reported non-cash after-tax charge of $692 million. The charge related to pension on mark-to-market was $670 million and the amount of the healthcare liability transfer was $22 million. More details on mark-to-market accounting are available in the presentation that is on the IR website. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2015 were $1.57 and GAAP earnings per share were $1.48. While fourth quarter 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.25 and GAAP earnings per share were $0.49.", "In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS\u2019 free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today\u2019s call along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. And just a reminder as on previous calls, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. Thank you for your cooperation.", "Now, I will turn the call over to David.", "David Abney", "Thanks, Joe. Good morning everyone. Our results make it quite a good morning here at UPS. I am pleased to report a very positive fourth quarter, capping our strong full year performance. A year ago, we laid out a plan for successful peak in 2015. This year, through the extraordinary efforts of UPS\u2019 around the globe, we delivered the high quality service that customers deserve and the financial discipline that shareowners expect. This was the fourth consecutive quarter that UPS exceeded financial expectations. In this quarter, we expanded margins and produced double-digit operating profit growth in all three business segments. That\u2019s worth repeating, all three segments demonstrated excellent operating profit growth. In fact, the International segment achieved its best quarterly and full year results ever, exceeding $2 billion in annual operating profit. UPS ended 2015 with record fourth quarter earnings per share and the highest operating profit ever reported. Full year 2015 diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $5.43, an all-time high.", "Although the industrial side of economy has slowed, the explosive growth of e-commerce continues to create great opportunity. I want to spend some time discussing how we capitalized on our peak season opportunity by managing the challenges it creates. I can sum it up in three words: collaboration, control, commitment. Expanded collaboration with customers combined with key investments were central to our success. We worked together with a shared interest in fully utilizing UPS network capacity while simultaneously maintaining excellent service. UPS implemented certain pricing controls and maintained disciplined operating plans to ensure our peak package [volume] [ph] did not jeopardize the overall integrity of the network and could be delivered on time.", "For example, we optimized available capacity during the weekend prior to Christmas and collaborated with customers to tender shipments ahead of the original schedule. This moved our peak day up to December 21 and smoothed volume for the rest of the week, ensuring our customers\u2019 packages reached their customers\u2019 doorsteps before Christmas. This year, our customers worked more closely with us than ever and I want to thank them for making adjustments and being flexible. Together, we delivered a successful peak season. Again, working closely with our customers, we delivered a successful peak season.", "Turning to control, our actions to tighten dispatch, reduce special sorts, and implement just-in-time hiring resulted in significant cost benefits for UPS as we exercised more precise control over the network. We also expanded capacity, opened more than 8,000 UPS Access Points in the U.S., and completed several automation projects across the network. These investments provide year-round benefits. In fact, our automated air facilities were essential in servicing nearly 13% growth in U.S. domestic air volume during the quarter. The flexibility of our integrated network also gave us the control needed to seamlessly move volume between air, rail and ground to maintain excellent on-time service. This year, we again implemented a management process called the control tower in the U.S. and expanded it to Canada and Europe. We handled customers\u2019 unplanned volume surges by efficiently utilizing available UPS network capacity. Our goal was to find a solution that worked for our customers and UPS. Working together, we were able to service more than 90% of these last minute requests.", "Another aspect of control is managing outside transportation cost, which spikes dramatically during this time of year. Our recent acquisition of Coyote Logistics helped manage this expense. They played an expanded role this peak season and provided truckload brokerage service for UPS and its customers. Coyote\u2019s synergies remained on plan.", "The final C is commitment exemplified by the actions of our employees to deliver on-time service during a period when our volume nearly doubles. There are numerous examples of UPSers going the extra mile everyday for our customers and they again demonstrated that commitment this peak season. I want to take a moment to say thank you to all the UPSers around the world whose enthusiasm and extraordinary efforts during the holiday season produced these great results. I am proud of their determination, dedication and hard work. While peak season 2015 helped drive strong fourth quarter results, we have turned our attention to 2016. Our business is more diverse than retail in peak season. Customers continue to choose UPS because of our broad portfolio of solutions across many industries like healthcare, aerospace, high tech and manufacturing. We will continue to capitalize on opportunities within these market segments by further expanding our network, improving operational efficiency and focusing on high growth and adjacent markets.", "Looking at the global economy, conditions remain uncertain with the first half of 2016 continuing the mixed economic trends from the last half of 2015. Across Europe and Asia, GDP growth was modest in 2015. However, slight improvements are expected this year. At the same time, we continue to see challenges in emerging markets in 2016. Global macroeconomic conditions reinforced the need for nations to continue making progress on free trade agreements such as TPP and TTIP. While the U.S. GDP growth outlook is muted for the first half of 2016, it is expected to gain strength in the second half. Further, the U.S. remains dependent on a consumer based economy for growth, while industrial manufacturing continues to be held down by a strong dollar and lower global demand. Through this uncertain backdrop, UPS will continue to implement our investment in growth strategies in 2016. Our strong execution of these strategies will enable UPS to continue to create excellent shareowner value.", "Now, Richard will give you more details.", "Richard Peretz", "Thanks David. It\u2019s good to be with you this morning and report on an outstanding fourth quarter. All three segments performed better than expected. They achieved solid results by focusing on revenue management and operational execution. These efforts expanded operating margins and increased shareowner value. Total fourth quarter revenue was up slightly to $16.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, it was up 2.4%. Changes to currency and lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue by more than $600 million. Overall, UPS produced fourth quarter earnings per share for 2015 of $1.57, up 26% from last year. Full year 2015 earnings per share were $5.43, a 14% increase over 2014. These results included discrete tax credits of about $0.07 for the quarter and $0.10 for the year. Excluding these on an annual basis, earnings per share grew more than 12%.", "Now turning to details within the business segments, In the U.S., we had a great quarter. Revenue was up 2.6% to $10.3 billion. Lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue growth by about 250 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.4%, led by deferred air products up 15% and Next Day Air up 10%. Clearly, UPS customers are choosing the value of our air products to meet their customers\u2019 expectations. Both business and residential deliveries grew in the quarter with B2C outpacing B2B two to one. E-commerce continued to drive higher residential shipments, in fact in December more than 60% of our deliveries were to consumers. Revenue per package increased slightly as strong base rates and product mix improvements were somewhat offset by lower fuel surcharges and changing customer mix. Operating profit jumped 18% to more than $1.3 billion and margin expanded 170 basis points to 13.1%.", "Solid execution of the peak operating plan and our network investments led to productivity gains. Average daily direct labor hours declined about 1%, with package deliveries increased 2.4%, some of the best results we have produced. The growth of e-commerce continues to increase delivery stubs in our network. During the fourth quarter, delivery stubs increased 5.1%. That\u2019s more than twice as fast as our volume growth. Technology investments such as ORION are enabling us to reduce the cost of residential stubs. As a result, we held package delivery miles flat and reduced cost per piece. These results demonstrate our ability to adapt. We are bending the cost curve and the U.S. team is delivering high quality service while improving efficiency and cost.", "Looking now at the International segment, we had a record-setting quarter and year, achieving a 16% improvement in our fourth quarter operating profit of $624 million, delivering greater than 10% profit growth every quarter in 2015. Our results are driven by two efforts. First, rate actions that began late in 2015 resulted in losing some low-yielding accounts, predominantly affecting the international domestic volume. And second, network management improvements continue to contribute to bottom line results. As we modified international block hours to match volume and trade lane demand. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion. Base rates increased across all regions, although they were offset by about a 350 basis points drag from lower fuel surcharges. Total export shipment growth slowed, reflecting the execution of previously mentioned pricing initiatives along with varying market growth rates around the world. Imports from Europe into the U.S. were strong for the fourth consecutive quarter, aided in part by the appreciating U.S. dollar. The International business continues to demonstrate the ability to adjust in an unsteady economic environment.", "Turning to the Supply Chain & Freight group, operating profits grew more than 11% with an expanded operating margin. Overall, revenue growth increased 6% with the addition of Coyote. However, organic revenue growth declined due to two factors; First, ongoing weakness in both forwarding and U.S. LTL markets. And secondly, the continuation of our targeted revenue management actions. Both the forwarding and UPS Freight units are executing initiatives that are driving change into customer mix to improve profitability. The forwarding unit improved operating margins as the group held firm with rates, achieving their highest buy/sell rate spread in the last few years. In UPS Freight, LTL revenue per hundredweight improved 2.1% with a drag of about 550 basis points from lower fuel surcharges. However, market conditions continue to challenge UPS Freight as they saw tonnage decline about 12%. The distribution unit saw double-digit revenue growth from targeted industries, healthcare and aerospace, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our cash flow. Throughout 2015, UPS continued to generate healthy free cash flow, producing over $5 billion after $2.4 billion in capital investments. Once again, we returned more than 100% of net income to shareowners as UPS purchased 27 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid out another $2.5 billion in dividends, up 9% per share over last year. Looking at our tax rate, as previously mentioned during the quarter, UPS resolved a few outstanding tax items. Together, these resulted in $63 million of discrete credits or about $0.07 per share. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be 35.25%.", "Now, I will cover the rest of our guidance. We expect 2016 to be another good year at UPS. Revenue should increase between 6% and 8%. Looking more closely at the segments, in the U.S., the domestic segment average daily volume should increase about 2% to 4%, driving revenue up 4% to 6%. Operating margin is forecasted to expand and operating profit should grow 5% to 9%. In the International business, shipments per day are projected to increase 2% to 4%. Growth rates will be held down during the first half of the year due to the revenue management actions we discussed earlier. We anticipate a drag of about 150 basis points from non-hedged currencies and lower fuel surcharges. As a result, revenue will grow at a similar pace as volume. Operating profit is expected to be up 8% to 12% with some margin expansion. In the Supply Chain & Freight segment, revenue should be up 15% to 20% with Coyote adding for the full year. The segment\u2019s organic revenue growth is projected between 3% and 5%.", "Operating profit growth is forecasted between 6% and 10%. However, first quarter growth will likely be down about 8% to 12% from last year due to the continued softness in the LTL, freight brokerage and freight forwarding markets. As a reminder, the West Coast port strike provided some benefits in 2015. Operating margin for the Supply Chain & Freight segment should be around 7%. For the total company, we expect our 2016 operating profit distribution by quarter to be very similar to 2015. From a cash flow perspective, investment in the business remains our first priority with CapEx expected to be about 4.5% of revenue or $2.8 billion. Next, we remain committed to paying the strong dividend.", "Finally, we have about $2.7 billion in share repurchases planned. As we have mentioned in the past, we will continue to follow this framework and make necessary adjustments if new opportunities arise. Overall, we expect 2016 to be a solid year for UPS. We will continue to execute on our investments as planned and the network improvements we are banking are producing financial benefits. As a result, we are projecting diluted earnings per share to increase within the range of $5.70 to $5.90, a growth rate of 5% to 9%. And when excluding the 2015 tax credits, our growth rate is 7% to 11%.", "In closing, despite the unsteady economic climate, we are well-positioned to make significant progress again in 2016. Thank you for your attention. I will ask the operator to open the lines so we can take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Yes, good morning, and congratulations on the strong results and the best of peak season. I wanted to \u2013 I guess it\u2019s one question, but it\u2019s really focused on your volumes within fourth quarter in Domestic Package. It was, I know you have had a spread of strong air volumes on, driven by e-commerce, but it seems that spread versus ground widened out. I was just wondering if you could give a sense of what were some of the key drivers of the Domestic Package volume and that spread in fourth quarter, what was B2B like in ground, what was the impact of your controls to have a peak, was that a big factor on the softer ground, and just was there a weakness of the economy? What were sort of the key drivers for the net domestic volume? Thank you.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Hey, Tom, this is Alan. Yes, certainly, it was a solid peak season. We delivered more than 612 million packages over the peak period. It\u2019s the most in the company history, up about 7%. And as you said, the air volume was well above our expectations in the quarter with the deferred growing almost 15 and Next Day at 10. The ground volume, yes, was a little bit below our estimates. Certainly, the soft industrial production that David mentioned and certainly some of the revenue management action on some of the low yielding accounts earlier in the year for peak had some impact. Our B2B growth was positive. If you remember last quarter, it went negative, but it rebounded last quarter. And as Rich mentioned, our resi grew at about a 2:1 ratio to the commercial. Thanks.", "David Abney", "Tom, this is David. When it comes to volume, I think it\u2019s worth taking the time to look at the \u2013 over the 2 years, the stock volume for the fourth quarter. And if you compare \u201813 to \u201815, you see that our total volume was up 9% and our ground volume was up 7.6%. So, when you look at it over a 2-year period, what you see is the \u201814 had a tremendous increase in ground and then we added to that, but the 2-year [stag] [ph] gives a pretty good picture of where we have been the last couple of years.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group", "Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So, one quick housekeeping question and then one broader question. Is there anything in the fourth quarter or the guidance related to this spot rate pension accounting that a lot of companies are doing? And then just bigger questions on the volume growth outlook, so forecasting an acceleration in volume growth and I think you kind of said it will be more back-end loaded, should we think about the \u2013 I guess what gives you confidence in that reacceleration in volume growth in the back half of the year? And then should we expect the earnings growth then to also be back-end loaded?", "Joe Wilkins", "This is Joe. Just before we get started, we are just going to do one question, because we get a lot of people, but we will take this dual-part question out, but Richard why don\u2019t you...", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. Scott, so the question you asked around pension is that we currently use a mark-to-market, it\u2019s on a \u2013 there is a deck presentation on our website, it explains the mark-to-market and we use that corridor approach for that. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 goes through the process and we have done that each year the last few years whenever we make an adjustment. This year, it was a much smaller adjustment. And I think once you go through that, after some more questions, we can handle that appropriately. In terms of the volume and the guidance on volume, we did have solid top line growth this year. In fact, it was 5% growth this year and we really see 2016 as the continuation of what we did in 2015. It does have some cycles through the quarters. Obviously, we talked about each quarter kind of looking similar to the previous year. And so when you think about how our volume grows, our revenue and our profits, I would point you back to that, but we feel real good about where we are at. We think it\u2019s not just what\u2019s happening outside externally on the macro environment, it\u2019s also all the initiatives and the things that we are doing inside UPS right now that are gaining traction and are actually the reasons that the results were so good for the fourth quarter and for all of 2015.", "David Abney", "And on the volume, just a little bit more on that. In 2015, we said all along due to peak cost and to other cost that we are going to have to focus on yield which we did. And for 2016, we just want to make sure that we have the right balance and I am absolutely confident that the team will between maintaining yield and increasing our volume. So, with the initiatives that we have, feel comfortable that we are going to maintain the air volumes the way they are and felt like that we will improve the ground volumes.", "Scott Group", "Yes, thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Sterling", "Thank you. Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on a nice quarter and outlook in a challenging environment and my wife thanks you for a successful peak season. Real quick on ORION, how much more do you have to implement across your driver network? And is it possible to quantify the cost savings in Q4 from ORION?", "Myron Gray", "Good morning, Kevin. This is Myron.", "Kevin Sterling", "Hi, Myron.", "Myron Gray", "During the year, we increased the deployment for ORION from 45% in 2014 to up to 70% by year\u2019s end. We expect to be completed with the deployment of ORION by the first day in January of \u201817 and we are extremely pleased with the results that we are getting today.", "David Abney", "And Kevin, this is David. I would want you to tell your wife we really appreciate her efforts to increase our volume. So, thank you for that.", "Kevin Sterling", "I will, thank you.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Nate Brochmann", "Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I was curious a little bit just about the Coyote acquisition in terms of how that\u2019s progressing so far and where you have seen the most benefits in terms of how you utilize that in terms of moving some of your own package freight throughout the network in the fourth quarter and also two in terms of just kind of seeing that business organically in terms of still working with their kind of core customer base?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, Nate, this is Alan. Coyote certainly performed well during peak and we are going to continue to expand that role. They were certainly one of the difference makers. They are playing a crucial role in our ability to manage our outside transportation services and cost, certainly year round, but very, very integral during the peak season. So, they provided the flexible capacity to meet the demand surges and they also helped us to improve our capacity utilization. On an overall basis, as David said in his opening comments, the synergies are on track. I would also say that we are getting some good purchase transportation procurement benefits and those are exceeding our expectations.", "Nate Brochmann", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great. Good morning and I echo a great job through the peak season, great to see. But I think you mentioned that you turned away 3% of volumes given the control tower, I just want to understand some of the economic commentary as you look ahead to your outlook, ground volumes remain up pretty slight, so are you still seeing a trade-up to Next Day Air and deferred just given the strength there or is this just an economic difference of e-commerce versus what you are seeing on the ground side?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. First of all, we didn\u2019t turn away 3% of our volume with the control tower. The control tower was an absolute success this year from both a customer and a UPS perspective. And I would also say from an e-commerce, retail and also a year round customer perspective, all the other industry segments that we serve, so a real success. And the primary goal there was to optimize the network capacity and find solutions that worked for our customers and UPS. And in fact, between Cyber Week and Super Weekend, we were able to accommodate all the customer requests. And during those final few days, there was a few that we needed to turn down. But even then, some of those were some dual source customers who chose not to make longer term business commitments to UPS. So we thought it was a resounding success. We had a very disciplined approach to the volume, the capacity and managing the yields to produce the excellent fourth quarter that we had.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great. I am sorry and the trade up down commentary?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. So look, I think that the \u2013 the air products are resonating really well with our customers and certainly, the just-in-time nature, so our deferred was up 14% and the Next Day Air overnight products mainly the Saver was up about 10%. And I think customers are choosing the services that they need based on the time in transit that they are looking for.", "Ken Hoexter", "Alright. Thank you for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben Hartford", "Thanks. Good morning. Jim, maybe this question is for you. I am a bit curious in your perspective on business inventories generally from customers, there has been a lot of discussion on some de-stocking, whether that has taken place in the fourth quarter, curious on your view on the International side what you are hearing as it relates to inventory de-stocking during fourth quarter, any planned de-stocking in 2016? And then any perspective that you can provide on the domestic side would be helpful as well? Thanks.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. This is Alan, I am going to take that first and pass it over to Jim. Certainly, what\u2019s happening, international has a forward impact on the U.S. but as you probably all know, the U.S. inventory sales ratio has come down slightly but it still remains elevated, certainly indicating we got continued overhang of inventories in the economy. And customers are obviously attempting to work them down. We expect the strong U.S. dollar to continue to influence the trade lanes. And I guess the last thing I will say is that our omni-channel e-commerce strategies like ship from store, enabling retailers to burn some of that off effectively.", "Jim Barber", "I guess, Ben I would add the comment probably from the forwarding perspective because that tends to be the kind of front end of some of these inventory moves. If you look at about the last year, what we have seen is a continued gap of demand and capacity, but I would say in the last two months of data, what we started to see is some load factors turning up. So as that moves forward, now we also have Chinese New Year coming on us right know, so that will give us our second read. But from that perspective, I think as some of the guys mentioned earlier, the buy/sell spreads, which is reflective of capacity and demand have been at its widest point through 2015. But early indications, there is a little bit of turn towards the end of 2015. But we don\u2019t see anything that spikes in a great way just yet, but that will lead us to further evaluation of the inventory. So appreciate the question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon", "Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Richard, great to hear the guidance on the domestic margin expansion, but I have a question for you on International. How much are we \u2013 how much are you guys seeing benefit from the currency gains in the fourth quarter, how should you expect that sort of hedge gain to play out in \u201916 and then should there be a cliff on the hedge roll-off in \u201917. We have got a lot of questions about how that International play out over the course of the year in terms of reporting gains on the currency hedge?", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. We use our currency hedge program that really is about protecting our profits. But when you separate that out, right now we do have protection for all of \u201816. And at different points through the last few years, we have gone in and made the necessary adjustments. But when we looked at the operating margin, it has improved a little bit because of the hedge and it\u2019s about 200 basis points or just over 200 basis points in the margin that you should be thinking about that\u2019s really driven because of the hedge program that\u2019s really meant to allow the operators to look at the business and step away from what\u2019s happening with the currency and come straight on growing the business. I am actually going to ask Jim to talk a little bit about the record setting year that international has had.", "Jim Barber", "Okay, thanks David and thanks Rich, I think. With respect to currency, that\u2019s going to work through in the hedges as Rich pointed out is how we manage it. I do want to point you back to what we consider to be a very solid year in International, a couple of obviously record breaking points. But I think the key for us is to continue to lean into the networks. We have talked to you in late 2014 at the investor conference about efficiencies and continuing to invest in the networks specifically up to about $2 billion in Europe. We continue on that path. Our Europe team continues to execute. We keep \u2013 we get revenue management initiatives to go with it. So all that really keeps us at the really end of the story, which is industry leading margins in the International business. And we will manage that and currencies will do what they will do and we will continue to grow the business internationally and manage to the top of the industry margins. So appreciate the question.", "David Vernon", "So just to kind of clarify, should we then be expecting that, that 200 basis points of margin to roll-off in \u201917 or are you guys making progress on mitigating that impact?", "David Abney", "It\u2019s a little early to start guiding you on \u201817, but there are certain actions that we are taking on. And as it becomes more appropriate to cover and things are more complete, we will give you a better story on that.", "David Vernon", "Alright. Thanks very much for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question will become from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison Landry", "Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question on pension and if you could provide or quantify what\u2019s embedded in your guidance in terms of the year-over-year expense tailwind or headwinds?", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. Thank you, Allison. When we look at the pensions overall, we are expecting our expense to actually be flat this year with 2015 and that\u2019s what\u2019s embedded in the guidance. The activities around pension are an important area for UPS, we continue to actively managing that area. And as I said for the year, it\u2019s going to be flat, so there won\u2019t be any increase in expense for 2016.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. So I guess just to focus here on Amazon for a moment, we saw several media reports late in the fourth quarter that the company is planning to leave a number of 767s and perhaps 737s to operate in both U.S. and Europe. If this is indeed the case, what impact do you think this move will have on the competitive pricing dynamics in the domestic and European express market?", "David Abney", "Okay. This is first David, and first let me make sure and express that Amazon is a good customer of ours. We have a mutually beneficial relationship. And our goal with Amazon or any other big customer is to continue to show our value to \u2013 through the integrated network and through our technologies and to have a value proposition that\u2019s difficult to match. We do add capacity and for large customers such as Amazon, we do it though we ensure we have the proper economic return. And at the same time, we also ensure the integrity of our network for all customers by planning and forecasting our volumes. So I didn\u2019t read anything that in the last quarter that we felt like is in \u2013 on any kind of substantial basis is going to affect our pricing, our pricing in the market. We just believe we need to continue to focus on our values, stay on our strategies and our technologies and we feel that we will have another good year this year as far as return to investors.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Hey, good morning guys and again congrats on the better outcome this year, totally different from 12 months ago. But can I just ask you, what\u2019s your general perception of industrial exposure in your Domestic Package network? Because if I look back historically when we saw IP contracting, I think it\u2019s been very difficult for UPS to get earnings. So, can you talk to some of the risk that the outlook has if the industrial economy keeps weakening? And then maybe some of the counter proactive or positive things are happening in the network that are giving you this positive outlook?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, Brandon, this is Alan. Look, I mean, I think the story with industrial production has been happening now for quite a while. Certainly, it\u2019s trending more negative than it has been. Our business today, as Rich said, even at peak season, we were up to 60% residential, so about half of our business is on the retail e-commerce side now. And I think we are going to be able to manage through that real well. I think the value proposition that we have in place for both retail and the other industry segments, including industrial manufacturing, high-tech and healthcare bode well. So, we feel pretty good that we have embedded these trends into our 2016 plans and are very confident in achieving those results.", "Richard Peretz", "And this is Richard and just a few other things I think that\u2019s important to think about when you think about what\u2019s embedded in our guidance is that the volume is based \u2013 is not just based on what\u2019s happening externally, it\u2019s also what\u2019s going on within UPS. And so we started out externally and look at various scenarios of what we think could happen. And so embedded in the range is different volume assumptions and that\u2019s why there is a range. But also it\u2019s the story about the economies that we are getting out of the ORION project and the adjustments we are making in the air network. You bring all that together and that\u2019s why the range is as we put it out there. So, we feel very confident that what we are putting out there is the expectation based on both the external and the internal efforts we are doing here at UPS.", "David Abney", "Just last \u2013 and this is David. Just the last comment on industrial production, if you are going to look at our results 5 years ago, I think there was a tighter correlation. Now of course, with our e-commerce and residential business growing as fast as it is, I think that maybe it\u2019s not quite as direct. And if you look at the fourth quarter, industrial production was down all 3 months of the fourth quarter and we had record results. And I think part of that was because consumer confidence is still high. And so, I wouldn\u2019t draw too much of a connection there if I was you, but thanks for the question.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Art Hatfield", "Thank you. Hey, thanks for taking my question. I hope I get this out appropriately or word this right. I think you have touched on this a little bit, but obviously e-commerce is going to continue to grow at a very rapid pace. And it seems to me that as we move forward, you are going to have more and more difficult decisions during peak with regards to having the potentially turn-away business. How do you think about that decision-making process going forward? And how do you balance all of your customers\u2019 needs?", "David Abney", "This is David. I will start that question and then I will hand it over to Alan. The key to remember this year though is our focus was not on capping or turning away customers, but the control tower. Our focus is to pull volume in, work with our customers and find ways to utilize sources or areas of our network that aren\u2019t kept such as we were very successful in pulling volume into the weekends. It\u2019s how we were able to actually move up peak date from the December 22 to the 21. So one of the ways that we addressed what you were just referring to is the way that we do manage [indiscernible]. We also had substantial capacity this year for peak and from our CapEx plans that\u2019s going to continue. And the increase in technology, ORION that you heard Myron talk about, over 70% utilized and Access Points and other technologies like that. So, I don\u2019t think we have a future of just seeing how much volume we can cap. It\u2019s just the opposite of how we can increase our capacity and how we can increase our effectiveness. Alan, from a customer standpoint?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "I would just say, look, we have talked for a while now about bending the cost curve and David talked about some of the things we are doing there with ORION. But UPS My Choice, Access Points, SurePost Redirect and SurePost this year, we redirected over 35% of our SurePost packages back into the network, where we were able to create a two-piece stop, our omni-channel strategy so on and so forth. I mean, all these things are working in concert to help us be able to manage peak at levels today, where this year our peak volumes will almost double what they are during the remaining part of the year. Keep in mind that as we work with these \u2013 all these projects here, a lot of them are focused in on delivery density. And one-tenth piece per stop increased creates about $200 million of operating profit improvement. So, we feel like the things that we are doing to our network now are going to enable us to handle bigger and bigger peaks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Thanks. Good morning. One last question about pricing, wanted to get a sense of maybe on the domestic side, how the core pricing looked and maybe how mix looked and whether or not we saw sort of an acceleration into the fourth quarter, I am just trying to get a sense that during peak is pricing stronger, are there other mix offsets that we should be thinking about? Thanks.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, hey, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. Certainly, we had strong base rate pricing improvements throughout 2015. The fourth quarter was no exception. We came in at the higher end of the 2% to 3% long-term target range. It\u2019s really \u2013 the GRI, the dim weight, some of the tactical pricing decisions as well as disciplined and prudent revenue management. For 2016, our expectation is to achieve again within 2% to 3% of the range for base rate improvements going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "John Barnes", "Hey, thanks. Let me echo my congratulations as well. Nice quarter. Hey, real quick, you talked a little bit in your guidance about some revenue management actions you have taken in Europe. It seems like LTL volumes continue to be a little bit weak there. I am just kind of curious, I mean, is \u2013 are there any other revenue management areas that you are attacking right now? Is LTL one or is this isolated to Europe? Can you elaborate on that just a little bit? Thanks.", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. This is Richard. And John, I think the last few quarters we have talked about the revenue management initiatives and David mentioned improving the yield in some of his comments. And the thing to keep in mind is it\u2019s really broad-based. We are doing it in small package. We are doing it in the international air freight market and the LTL. It\u2019s really about making sure we have the right customers and the right yields in each of our networks.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Ross", "Yes, good morning gentlemen. Question on the peak season volumes, the last couple of years, in \u201813, \u201814, the peak period was about 72%, 73% over a normal week period or a normal period. Alan just said it was nearly twice this year. So, was that 75%? Was that 95%? And in addition to that kind of what can you do in 2016 to make the network run even better during peak than it did this year? Thank you.", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. And this is Richard again. When you look across peak, obviously, peak is a little different at different weeks of it. But when you go across the entire peak period, it was slightly elevated from where it was last year and we move the peak day up by one because the available capacity over the weekends and the customers collaborating with us made the necessary adjustments. I am going to ask Alan to talk a little bit about it specifically, but what\u2019s going on with volume, Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Look, my point was that during peak, we handle almost double on any given day, but the spike occurs on an ongoing basis between Cyber Monday and Christmas Day. Throughout the quarter, our volume between October and November was softer and December on a secular basis continued to rise.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Alex Vecchio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Alex Vecchio", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the LTL environment, broadly speaking, it\u2019s been several quarters now that volumes have been challenged not just for you but for the entire industry. And I guess I want to get a sense from you guys to the extent to which you are seeing increasingly competitive or aggressive pricing behavior from your peers, are you starting to see any of that or would you kind of characterize the industry as still broadly holding discipline on price?", "Myron Gray", "Alex, this is Myron. If you go back to the fourth quarter of \u201814, each corresponding quarter, we have continued to see softness in the market and it\u2019s adversely affected each of the carriers in the market. However, base rate improvements have remained steady and we are not seeing any adverse actions to the negative that are being taken by any carriers that we would expect that to remain that way moving forward.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Matt Troy of Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Matt Troy", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just had a pretty straightforward inquiry on CapEx, I was wondering if you could talk about your CapEx budget for 2016, I know you guys have had a lot of irons in the fire in terms of optimization and modernization programs across the network. So just wondering what the capital budget is for 2016 and what are some of the major projects and allocations from that budget we can expect you guys to make progress on in 2016? Thanks.", "Richard Peretz", "Sure, Matt. This is Richard. Our CapEx, as I mentioned in my talk, is expected to be about $2.8 billion right now. The model that we built at UPS in the network is very unique and we are continuing to make the necessary adjustments in automating our Tier 1 buildings, but we are going at a measured pace because we also have to make sure that we continue to provide the service that our customers expect. In fact, in the last few years, we have actually doubled the spend in our buildings and facilities and we expect that, that will continue and that\u2019s probably the area where we will be spending the most money next year. But the results of this quarter were really driven by the investments we made in the last few years and that\u2019s helped us to achieve the margins and the profit level that we got for 2015. Thank you.", "Matt Troy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Kelly Dougherty", "Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. I just wanted to think about the different macro outlooks throughout the world and can you give us a sense of how much of your revenue you would estimate touches the U.S. at least at one end, so whether it\u2019s generated domestically or imports or exports. And then also maybe you could give us a similar estimate for Europe as well?", "Richard Peretz", "Yes. Kelly, this is Richard again. When you think about the total company, obviously the U.S. is a very large piece of our business and we have talked about the importance not only of the U.S. but also both imports and exports coming into and leaving the U.S. And today of course, the imports into the U.S. are stronger and that\u2019s really something we have seen because of the strength of the dollar, so exports coming out of the rest of the world coming into the U.S. are much higher. And we have talked about in the past that Europe is a very large part of our international. It\u2019s about 50% of the International business. So together, those two are a large \u2013 very large part of the company, but the other pieces of the network are important because the customers are sending packages all over the world back and forth.", "Kelly Dougherty", "Is there any way to kind of quantify 75, 80 whatever that number is percent of your revenue actually touches the U.S. in some way, shape or form?", "Joe Wilkins", "Kelly, this is Joe. We can take that detailed question offline when we talk later on today.", "Kelly Dougherty", "Okay.", "Joe Wilkins", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rob Salmon", "Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for squeezing me in here. With regard to the margins in Q4, U.S. domestic package got back to in line margins for the full year and I think it\u2019s a testament to a lot of the internal initiatives that you guys were calling out as well as the strength on pricing, how are you guys thinking about margins looking out next year and it appears that within domestic, are the international initiatives enough where that we will start to see fourth quarter margins again be better despite the greater concentration of home deliveries and B2C shipments or should we kind of think about it roughly in line with the broader full year overall margin in U.S. domestic package?", "Richard Peretz", "Rob, again this is Richard. I think you have to look at 2016 and David actually made a comment earlier that this is going to be a balanced year. So there is both volume growth and making sure that we align the revenue with the resources that are used in UPS, that\u2019s very important. As well, in the last few years, we have been down this road of improving our internal operations. You saw that because for the first time, you actually see stops going growing twice as fast as volume, yet your cost per stop came down. And that\u2019s a testament to the technology and the U.S. operations it had a good quarter. And I will actually ask Myron to comment on that.", "Myron Gray", "So Rob, let me begin by thanking the thousands of UPSers who help to execute on the well designed plan. We will continue to deploy technology, tighten our direct labor hours and add capacity where necessary to take advantage of this expedited growth in residential deliveries. Deployments like ORION that helped us control our miles actually they were flat in the fourth quarter. Our direct labor hours were down from last year and the service was exceptional. And we continued to deploy Access Points that gave control and convenience to our customers. So, we believe that this expedited growth and residential deliveries don\u2019t pose any support moving forward. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Helane Becker of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker", "Thanks very much operator. Hi gentlemen. Thank you also for the time. As you guys think about the CapEx you are spending on improving the technology in the buildings, are you actually able to grow without adding additional headcount? And I think Myron, maybe you just started to address that question with respect to improving margins without increasing either headcount or salaries that much?", "Myron Gray", "I think our automation strategy will allow us to not add headcount. And our automation strategy moving forward is to either deploy technology in the existing footprint that we have when we build new buildings or where we may need to add capacity that would help us reduce handles. In the fourth quarter, our direct labor hours were flat. Now we hired what we expected in terms of people that 90,000 to 95,000. But because of this automation, we were able to bring them on much later at peak and our actual hours were down 8%. So we don\u2019t see a need to add headcount. Thank you.", "David Abney", "Yes, this is David. Just to put a recap on that. Each of these automated facilities we see about a 20%, 25% efficiency. So it gives you an idea of what they mean to us. Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mr. Kauffman your line is open. We will move on to our next question from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Bascome Majors", "Thanks for squeezing me in here guys. Just to kind of step back, if you are going to have to design a parcel network from scratch to serve e-commerce customers, leverage the residential deliveries, can you talk a little bit about how are we different from the network that you have today?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Look, I think that the network that we have today, the air and ground integrated network is second to none and the enhancements we are making to that network, whether it\u2019s the operational efficiencies that Myron talked about with ORION and hub automation or whether it\u2019s some of the customer-facing technologies that we are putting in place that also help reduce cost to make us more efficient and to make us attractive to both consumers and retailers is really the best network in the business. And again, when you think about this e-commerce ecosystem that we are putting in place with our base ground and air package network adding on the UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point, the Synchronized Delivery Solution, the SurePost and the SurePost Redirect, our returns portfolio, i-parcel, combining that with some of the efficiencies really makes UPS network the e-commerce network of the future.", "Operator", "And due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks for taking me guys in there. Congratulations. Just back to B2B domestically, if you could address it in U.S. package and Supply Chain & Freight, just how did you see the trend as you ended fourth quarter and into first quarter? And if you could speak a little bit to end markets that were most impacted good or bad? Thank you.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes, hey, this is Alan, thanks for the question. So, certainly, in the U.S. here, our B2B business was positive all year with the exception of a slight dip in the third quarter growing at or about half the pace of B2C. And like we said, it rebounded back in the fourth quarter, but mainly driven by retail. Certainly, on the Supply Chain & Freight side of our business, the vast majority of that business is in fact B2B. And in the International business, a much larger preponderance of our business is B2B, so the growth you are seeing in there would impact also B2B.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference back over to our Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Joe Wilkins. Please go ahead.", "Joe Wilkins", "Thank you, Steven. Appreciate it. I will now turn it over to David Abney for closing comments.", "David Abney", "Good. Thanks, Joe. We are successfully executing our strategies and capitalizing on our investments. Due to the strong peak, the fourth quarter, the four consecutive quarters of 2015 where we exceeded expectations are all evidence of our execution. We are carrying this momentum into 2016. We feel good about the year even with a little less certain environment around us and we expect once again to deliver strong earnings growth this year.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we'll take only one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkins, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Joe Wilkins - Investor Relations Officer", "Good morning, and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are, David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn. Also joining us today is Norm Brothers, our General Counsel.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2015 Form 10-K. This report is available on the UPS investor relations website, and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on the UPS investor relations website. And just as a reminder, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. Thanks for your cooperation.", "Now, I will turn the call over to David.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Joe. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review another excellent quarter. I want to take a moment to say thank you to UPS employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in delivering more than 13% earnings per share growth this quarter. The International segment sustained its momentum with its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. Domestic business also expanded operating margins as efficiency gains enhanced bottom line results, while Supply Chain & Freight performed slightly ahead of our expectations.", "Our accelerated investments in the UPS network are improving business results. This is enabling us to deliver strong financial results despite the current mixed macroenvironment. In the U.S., GDP forecasts continue to be revised downward, yet consumer spending remains the primary catalyst for growth in the economy and e-commerce sales have again exceeded the expectations.", "On the other hand, industrial production remains below 2015 levels. In Europe, economic expansion has slowed slightly, but the pace of growth remains healthy, while in Asia the major economies showed positive signs of stabilization as exports from China improved in March. Despite these mixed economic conditions, we remain committed to making investments for growth and efficiency. We will continue to implement our enterprise strategy, providing UPS customers with increased choice, convenience and control.", "During the quarter, we launched enhanced products to support customers' needs for earlier delivery. Our Next Day Air Early now serves almost 30% more zip codes, strengthening our leadership position in offering the earliest next-day deliveries. We also increased our Worldwide Express small package offering to 23 new countries and territories. UPS now offers guaranteed noon delivery on the next possible business day to 88 countries around the world.", "In addition to broadening our service portfolio for growth, we also are investing in our infrastructure with innovative technology and major facility expansions. The ability to combine our integrated network with the latest operating technology helps UPS deliver industry-leading margins and provides tremendous value to our customers.", "ORION is a great example of how we use predictive analytics and big data to improve service, while bending the cost curve lower. Our future plans for ORION will enhance the benefits for UPS, and our customers. In fact, I recently had the great honor on behalf of all UPSers to accept the prestigious 2016 Franz Edelman Award recognizing ORION, and UPS's leadership in operations research.", "In addition to innovation and on-road technologies like ORION, we're making major investments in new capacity and modernized facilities, both in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we're expanding major facilities in Metro L.A., Denver, Chicago, and other areas around the country. In Europe, as part of our $2 billion European investment plan announced in 2014, we opened a larger automated hub in Lyon, France, tripling our capacity in the area, and we also announced an automated facility expansion in Herne, Germany. Adding to these examples of our innovative infrastructure is our commitment to global leadership in alternative fuels.", "This quarter, we announced an additional $100 million investment to expand compressed natural gas in our delivery and facility network. Our alternative fuel vehicles are now 6% of our global fleet, and have helped UPS reduce its annual use of conventional fuel by 10%. We are well on our way to achieving our goal of driving one billion miles worldwide by 2017, with our alternative fuel vehicles.", "As we invest in the U.S. and abroad, the ability to grow our business is accelerated by global trade. Recently, the President signed the trade facilitation and trade enforcement act. This important legislation is designed to modernize, strengthen and streamline cross-border trade, facilitating faster clearance of goods into the U.S. UPS strongly supports the expansion of free trade around the world. We are developing additional solutions that assist buyers and sellers to transact business across borders.", "So, in summary, the first quarter results demonstrate the differentiating value of our integrated network in global portfolio. Our investments in technology and capacity are producing network efficiencies and giving us more control over the cost drivers in our business, and this is providing improved financial results. At UPS, we are innovating and investing to ensure we anticipate the needs of our 10 million customers.", "Before Richard covers the quarterly financial results, I have asked Norm Brothers, our General Counsel, to provide an update on developments surrounding the Central States proposed benefit reduction plan. Norm?", "Norman M. Brothers - Secretary, Senior Vice President & General Counsel", "Thanks, David, and good morning. This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The Central States Plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from the fund in 2007 as part of our collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, we agreed to provide supplemental benefits in the event that certain benefits were lawfully reduced. As a reminder, in December 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which for the first time ever, allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees subject to specific guidelines written into the statute and government oversight. As a result of this law, the Central States Pension Fund submitted a benefit reduction plan for approval to the U.S. Department of Treasury in the fall of 2015.", "As we explained in our 2015 10-K, we are challenging the Central States Plan because we firmly believe that it does not comply with the law. According to this new statute, we currently expect a decision from the Department of Treasury on or before May 7, unless there's some agreement to delay the process. Of course, Treasury could reject Central States' proposal, confirming our position. If this happens, the benefits paid from Central States will not be reduced without further action.", "In the event this plan is approved as proposed, we fully intend to continue challenging it and pursue all legal remedies available to UPS. As we gained additional information during the quarter, we continue to assess the possible impact of Treasury's review of the plan on UPS. This is a new law and the first time the approval process has ever been used.", "And as I stated, we firmly believe the proposed benefit reduction plan does not comply with the law. We recognize there are lot of unanswered questions, but without Treasury's decision, we're not going to speculate. However, we still thought it was important to provide you an update on the process.", "Now, I will turn it over to Richard for a financial review of the issue.", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Thanks, Norm. We estimate that if Central States Plan is approved as proposed and implemented, we would be required to record a charge of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion later this year. Our estimates are based on the information currently available to UPS. And it assumes, among other things, that the Plan's implementation is not delayed. If this charge is necessary, we expect it will be treated as an interim mark-to-market pension charge, and will be reflected in this year's financial results. In addition, there may be an increase in the ongoing pension expense that could impact 2016. Following our call today, we'll provide a presentation on the IR website regarding this subject.", "Now, let's move on to the business and how it continues to perform. As David said, the consumer is driving the economy, and that translates into opportunities for UPS. During the quarter, we turned e-commerce growth into expanded margins and increased operating profit in the U.S. Domestic segment. This, combined with momentum in our International business and slightly better than expected performance in Supply Chain & Freight segment, produced another strong quarter.", "Now, let's go a little deeper into the results. Starting with the U.S. Domestic segment, where operating profit increased $78 million, or almost 8%. And operating margin expanded 50 basis points, to 12.1%. Revenue was up 3.1% over last year to $9.1 billion. However, lower fuel surcharges were a drag of about 120 basis points on the growth rate. Average daily volume increased 2.8%, with the ground products up 3.3% and Next Day Air up 3%. After five continuous quarters of double-digit growth, deferred products declined slightly.", "E-commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with B2C up more than 6%. Interestingly, supporting B2B growth during the quarter, online purchases drove demand for UPS's best-in-class return services portfolio, which grew double digit this quarter. Base rates increased about 2% but were offset by changes in package characteristics and the mix of product and customers. There was 120 basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges that weighed on the reported deals. As a result, total revenue per piece was down 1.3% from the prior year. This quarter, the margin expansion was driven by the excellent cost management demonstrated. Cost per piece was down 1.9% compared to last year. Network efficiencies continue to improve, and we're seeing those improvements in our bottom line.", "At the foundation of our success this quarter is the continued benefits of the UPS integrated network overlaid with our unique technology. Looking at our key daily statistics, and this is where we're seeing good improvement, is the expansion of ORION lower driver miles by about 1% despite the fact that total stops grew by about 6%. In addition, overall productivity gains held direct labor hours to an increase of 1.8%, well below the average daily volume growth. As these trends continue, UPS is improving the stop economics of e-commerce.", "Now, let's turn to the International segment. As David said, we are reporting our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. International operating profit increased more than 15%, reflecting the impact of disciplined pricing, better network efficiencies, and in-country cost control.", "Revenue, on a currency-neutral basis, was slowed this quarter by management actions we implemented in the third quarter of last year. In addition, lower fuel surcharges negatively affected the growth rate by about 200 basis points. Currency-neutral revenue per piece was up 1.6%, with Domestic products up 2.8%. Strong base rate improvements were across all regions of the world and contributed to the best yield growth in more than two years.", "Revenue management actions also affected International volume, mainly the non-U.S. Domestic products. Meanwhile, we saw increased demand out of Asia and Europe into the U.S., offsetting lower U.S. exports. Export volume has started recovering from the revenue management actions we started in mid-2015. Fewer local operating days, mostly due to the timing of the Easter holiday, lowered the growth rate by about 200 basis points.", "Now, let's discuss the Supply Chain & Freight segment, where operating profit was better than anticipated but slightly less than last year as the segment managed through a tough economic backdrop.", "Total revenue on a currency-neutral basis was up more than 11%, driven by the addition of Coyote Logistics. The asset-light, truckload brokerage business is managing well, even in a market that remains soft, and the synergies remain on plan. In addition, market conditions remain weak, both in the Air Freight Forwarding and UPS Freight markets. In the Freight Forwarding unit, international air freight kilos were down, and it's due to a combination of re-pricing efforts in 2015 and an overall softer market. Margins expanded as the unit held firm with rates and achieved higher buy/sell rate spreads.", "Distribution revenue on a currency-neutral basis was up around 7%. Supported by our industry-specific solutions, we had double-digit gains in healthcare, aerospace, and industrial manufacturing sectors. UPS Freight remained committed to disciplined revenue management. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.1% as the unit continued to focus on serving higher-yielding middle-market customers, yet total tonnage declined as market conditions remain challenging.", "Now, for an update on our cash position. The company generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow after investing almost $430 million in capital expenditures. UPS improved its quarterly dividend by almost 7% during the quarter and paid about $670 million in dividends, and the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $680 million.", "Now, I'd like to update you on our guidance for 2016. The first quarter results continued our momentum from last year, and we remain on track for 2016. Economic conditions around the world will remain mixed. However, our business model is adapting well in this environment. In addition, International and Supply Chain & Freight will lap certain pricing actions we took last year. Based on our current performance, we reaffirm our 2016 full-year guidance of $5.70 to $5.90 adjusted earnings per share.", "This guidance does not include any impact for the Department of Treasury's decision on the benefit reduction plan. Regardless of how UPS chooses to respond to Treasury's decision, we still expect to remain within our 2016 guidance. However, if the plan is approved and implemented without delay, the ongoing expense could possibly push us towards the lower end of the range. As we stated earlier, we fully intend to continue challenging the plan if it is approved by Treasury.", "To summarize, this quarter is an example of how our accelerated investments are providing benefits across the company. We are adapting to the changing market conditions, bending the cost curve, and at the same time, producing strong financial results. We are well-positioned to continue to make progress through the rest of 2016.", "And now, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for the questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Ben Hartford, Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning, guys. Just want to know your thoughts on yield, just given the competitiveness that we're seeing in truckload rates, in particular, during 2016 at 2% base rate within Domestic. What is the likelihood that that meets or exceeds that level as we move through 2016?", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Hey, Ben, this is Alan. First of all, we saw some really good volume growth in the U.S. that certainly was in line with our expectations, and we continue to align the revenue to the value we create and with the costs incurred. The first quarter 2016, we certainly continued our successful base rate strategy and we did achieve a base rate increase between the 2% and 3%. It was offset by about 120 basis points to lower fuel surcharges, as well as continuing to still see some significant changes in the customer and the product mix, and the package characteristics that are also weighing on that base rate increase.", "Just one quick example here, SurePost, it's the lowest revenue piece product in our portfolio by its nature. It achieved double-digit growth this quarter. It also has some of the highest delivery density in our network, and it generates excellent profitability and ROIC, and it's even more profitable when we combine that with the SurePost Redirects. We've got a lot of examples where we're focusing on driving profits where the revenue to cost ratio is, where the RPP is actually lower than average, like SDS, UPS Access Point returns, they're all significant density creators. I don't know, Rich, you got some comments?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Yeah. Ben, the other thing that's important to understand that, as we make the adjustments for how the characteristics are changing, the benefits that we're seeing on how we're handling within our network and the implementation of our technology is showing up in the bottom line, as you saw the cost per piece actually reduced almost 2%. And that created the margin expansion in the U.S.", "Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. If I could just ask a clarifying comment there; is there enough disconnect in terms of the customer conversations that B2C and e-commerce growth can be viewed separately from the broader kind of freight fundamentals, specifically the pricing on the truckloads, such that you can continue to get positive and healthy yields with regard to B2C, in particular, even though broader freight rates in 2016 appear to be much weaker than that?", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah, I think there's definitely two distinct markets there. It's certainly a competitive market, but we focus our pricing consistent with the value we provide to our customers, and we're continuing to enhance our efficiencies, like Richie said, and our value proposition with what David mentioned on the UPS Early Express, so on and so forth. So, yeah, we're confident in being able to achieve the range of 2% to 3% going forward.", "Joe Wilkins - Investor Relations Officer", "Thanks, Ben. This is, Joe. As we move forward, let's just keep it to one question so that we can get as many on as possible. Thanks, Ben. Next question?", "Operator", "Tom Wadewitz, UBS. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah, good morning. I just wanted ask around the International margin improvement. Congratulations on the strong margin improvement there. I was wondering if you could give us the sense of, I guess, you talked about some of the key drivers, but does the pace of that accelerate, does it kind of sustain in terms of some of the things you're doing to drive that almost 300 basis points of margin improvement? Just so we have a kind of a way to look at it going forward the next couple of quarters. Thank you", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure, Tom. And this is, Richard. I think the first thing, it was a very strong quarter, but our focus is really on our earnings \u2013 our growth in earnings and economic value more than the margin, because there are fluctuations in the network, and which products are growing stronger year-in and year-out.", "The other thing to keep in mind is that the hedge program that we've really had in place for multiple years does aid the margins. Even if you adjust out for that, you're still talking about almost a 17% margin, which is the best in the industry. I'm going to ask Jim to actually comment on a few of the initiatives driving the improvements in International.", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International", "Thanks, Rich. So, Tom, I think it's really a two-part question for me. One is backward looking, how we've done. You've seen the last five quarters. We feel good about that. I think the other side to it is that, at the same time, right in line with our overall growth strategy, we're able to invest in some of these growth platforms we've talked about over the last year, year and a half. Like Access Points, like southern and trade lane borders across the world in emerging markets, so that ultimately, it's \u2013 here and now you see the margins and you hear Richie's comment with respect to the lift in currency, and so on and so forth, but the general operating efficiency and base rates is holding us, but at the same time, we feel really good, I do, about the investments we're making for long-term at the same time. So appreciate the question.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. Just maybe a little bit of clarification on the pension exposure you talked about at the opening of the call, the $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion. Is that a one-time charge; is that a cash expense that you'd have to pay out? And then, more on the ongoing level you talked about. Can you talk about the ongoing impact and what the ongoing cost exposure could be? You talked about moving to lower end of the range, but just maybe give us some parameters on what the ongoing expense would be? Thanks.", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure. So, I think the first question you asked was, whether it was a one-time payout. And actually, the way that \u2013 first of all, it's a complicated topic, and there will be a deck, I mentioned, out on the website to explain a little bit better. But it really isn't something we're paying to a third party. It would be a liability that we would have to take on.", "But that being said, we look at many different scenarios, and we feel comfortable that even if this was approved, and while we go down the path of looking at other options legally, that it would have a operating income impact, but it would still keep us within the range that we gave at the beginning of the year.", "So there's a lot of unanswered questions that we just don't know until we know more from treasury's decision. But at this point, that's really all we can share with you.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And this is David Abney. Just want to remind people that we do not know how treasury is going to decide. We're expecting a decision between now and May 7, May 8, but they could reject or they could accept. We just felt it was important to get the information out that just gives you an idea if they did accept the plan. But we really don't have an idea of which way that they're going to decide, so we don't want to send any other impression out there. Okay.", "Operator", "David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys. Richard, maybe a question for you on the productivity side, it seems like the mix was a little bit weaker in the quarter. I'm just wondering if that's kind of a fair assessment. And then, as you think about that decline of 190 basis points year-over-year in the unit cost for the Domestic segment, was that influenced any way by the mix? Did you get some help there for some of the lighter weight or lower cost products versus kind of pure productivity? Is there any way to think about sort of breaking up that 190 basis points in relation to mix? Thanks.", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure. Because we run an integrated network, and when you think about the activities that occur, mix has a little bit of play when SurePost grows faster. But I would tell you that, we expected SurePost to grow faster this year. Last year, we talked about the two-year stack, and we knew that SurePost would continue to grow.", "But that being said, when you look specifically at what we're doing in the U.S., with how direct labor hours are being managed, because of really the overlay of ORION, and what we're able to do with reducing miles, at the same time is increasing stops, it's something we're starting to see the last few quarters, and it's something we still expect to continue to see.", "And I'm actually going to ask, Myron, to talk a little about some of the initiatives that he has seen from ORION, and what's happening in it, because the expansion of the margin really was something that we did expect, and we continue to expect.", "Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President", "So, David, it's really a combination of a number of activities that we're undertaking to continue to bend the cost curve. Richard has referred to ORION, and yes, while our stops grew almost 6%, we were able to reduce our miles by 1%. But when you add in SurePost Redirect, coupled with Access Points, it allows us to build greater densities, and we're taking advantage of it.", "You've also heard us talk about SDS and EDGE, which we'll be talking more about later this year. Those activities combined, regardless of the mix, has allowed us to continue to bend that cost curve. Then you couple that with some of the automation projects that we have in place, it's not only allowing us to bend the cost curve, but it's also ramping up our service to our customers.", "Operator", "Chris Wetherbee, Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the ground volume growth, which was impressive in the quarter. We definitely saw a re-acceleration. And I think in the comments, you mentioned that the B2B side benefited probably from e-commerce returns. Just wanted to get a sense if you could parse out maybe sort of how the industrial side of your business is sort of trending, and maybe if you expect that ground growth to continue through the rest of the year here, outside of what we saw from e-commerce, which is probably at least partially holiday-related. So, any comments there would be helpful.", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah. Thanks, Chris. This is Alan. Yeah, as you said, we had a really strong growth of B2C growth and our customers are really responding to the choices we're providing. The e-commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with the B2C up more than 6%. And by the way, that was our best B2C growth in the last five quarters. And like Rich said, we achieved margin expansion with that growth of B2C. The online purchases are continuing to drive demand for UPS's best-in-class return services, which are, essentially, a business delivery, and we did see mid-teens return growth there. We think, as B2C grows, we're going to continue to see very strong returns growth there that is going to help our B2B segment.", "So, overall, B2B is still in positive territory, but it's still being impacted by the softness in industrial production. But we've been positive on B2B growth for the last few years now, with the exception of one quarter. So the economy certainly is soft out there when it comes to industrial production, but we think the combination of our B2C and our B2B value proposition to the non-retail segment is going to allow us to continue to grow that B2B business.", "Operator", "Nate Brochmann, William Blair.", "Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, this has been well publicized, in terms of a very high profile customer kind of maybe doing some more things in-house, and I know we've talked about the value proposition for UPS a lot over the years. But have you seen probably the majority of what they plan to do already taken in-house, in terms of that already kind of being behind you? And has that impacted at all kind of the density benefits that maybe we were on previous trajectory to be able to get, and do you have to do anything to circumvent that?", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, Nate, this is David. Yeah, I'll just start off with saying that that high-profile customer, I think because of the scale and the scope, gets a lot of attention in everything that they do, obviously can appear under the microscope. I can tell you though that we value our mutually beneficial relationship and obviously we'll evaluate any market moves that any company or customer makes, and we look at it from a competitive standpoint.", "But where I really want to focus is our integrated network creates efficiencies and just gives us a value proposition that is very difficult to match. Our diverse customer base also, just from a density standpoint, no single company is going to be able to match that. So we add value with global scale and scope. We continue to invest in technology to deliver high-value solutions, and there are going to be customers that are going to utilize us as a single source. There's going to be other customers that are going to adjust and sometimes go single source, sometimes go multiple vendors, and sometimes they will bring some work inside, take it in-house, and that's going to adjust as conditions adjust. But we feel we have a good relationship with that customer and feel that we will continue to add value for many, many years to come. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So can we come back to the economic picture? I mean, you guys talk a lot about how you move 6% of U.S. GDP in your network every day. How do we read the divergence in industrial production and consumer growth, plus really weak international trade, but you're still seeing premium expansion in your network. What does this all mean for GDP and IP looking forward? And have your customers given you any view on expectations heading into the back half of the year on inventories and growth?", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, Brandon, thanks for the question; this is David. And yeah, our customers have given us a lot of views. And I'll give the same impression to that that I would to the customers, that is it's very mixed. And U.S. GDP has obviously weakened. Even today, the numbers that came out quarter-over-quarter has showed weakness and year-over-year slight deterioration.", "But again, you can look and you can find bright spots and then you can find things that worry you. On the one hand, consumer spending continued to be the primary economic driver in the U.S. On the other hand, industrial production has been disappointing; although I can say there has been some recent data on manufacturing that is showing some sign of expansion.", "On the one hand, again, online retail is continuing to grow much faster than many expected. On the other hand, the especially brick-and-mortar retailers have not done so well. Again, on one hand, inflation and unemployment have stabilized, although wage growth, of course, has been muted. And when you look at it internationally, I think the same thing, you're going to see positives and you're going to see things that concern you. From the European Union, we still expect to see that economy grow at a fairly solid pace compared to the recent past, but there are signs of slowing, especially in some countries.", "Emerging markets, you see some concerns there, especially in Brazil and Russia. China, though, the GDP forecast has stabilized. You look at U.S. exports, because of the strength of the dollar that, of course, has weakened. But when you look at European exports imported into the U.S., that has been pretty solid.", "But my final point, and I think it's what's led to our success the last four quarters or five quarters and will continue to lead to it is that regardless of these challenges, we have to make challenges opportunities, and it's how we execute our investments, our strategic initiatives. If we continue to execute, we have proven and will continue to prove that we can have success in this mixed economic environment. So thank you for the question. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, thanks, morning, guys. Just one quick question, just going back to the pension issue for a second. If this thing happens, does it have any impact on capital allocation, share buybacks, either for this year or next year?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "The short answer is, it does not have any impact on 2016. We continue to allocate capital the way that we planned. For everything, for 2016, we continue on the plan. There's a lot of unanswered questions we talked about, but that won't change what we're doing for this year. And for 2017, later in the year when I guide, we'll go through that as I told you when we've gone through multiple scenarios and certainty will be understood a little differently. And then we'll make the appropriate plans because there are different things and different tools available to us as well. So, I just think it's too early to look at that, but 2016 will continue as is.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks, good morning. In terms of your comments that you are improving the stop economics of B2C, first, can you carve out the impact of productivity gains versus fuel in the 2% improvement? And then curious if the rapid growth in e-commerce is finally starting to lead to density increases in local and regional markets. Thank you.", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure. So, Allison, again, this is Richard. And the interesting thing is, you're right, fuel is lower. It does have an impact on both the cost and the revenue, but if you pulled those out, we still had negative cost per piece growth. And so we are seeing that the benefits of everything that we've been really building the last two years showing up in the bottom line and we actually talked about the margin expansion and that plan is a multi-year plan. And so that will continue as we expected it to. And that's it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jack Kauffman (sic) [Jeff Kauffman], Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hi, everybody. Good morning. It's Jeff. I just wanted to ask a question about CapEx and free cash flow. There was tremendous free cash generation this first quarter. So congratulations. But you threw off almost $2.6 billion in free cash, and I was modeling about $5.5 billion for the year. Have you changed your capital plan at all or is there a reason free cash might be a little stronger than expected this year, obviously holding off for anything that may or may not happen with this pension situation?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure. Again, this is Richard. When you actually look at our cash position and where we're at as a company, after the first quarter we're about where we were last year. In fact, our cash is slightly about $100 million less than last year at this point. So, when we look at our plan, it's about the whole year. And I also want to remind you that a large portion of our cash, about 40%, is offshore. And repatriation would cause additional tax, and we need that money offshore for the investments we're making in Europe and Asia, as well. So our plan was built at the beginning of the year, and it's something that we're working that plan, and that plan really is built to return to shareholders what we've been doing previously. We're investing $2.8 billion in CapEx, and we actually spent about 20% more the first quarter this year than we did last year, so we'll continue working that plan.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, this is David. I just want to clarify a little bit that we are clearly opposing the Central States Plan and that shouldn't indicate any change on our part to our long-term capital expenditure plan. So, again, this is something that has not happened. We don't know if it will or it won't. So I don't want anyone to read into comments that maybe we're adjusting our strategy based on this. We continue to execute this capital plan just as we originally planned. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Art Hatfield, Raymond James.", "Art W. Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, morning. Thanks for taking my question this morning. With one of our competitors getting ready to make, or hopefully making an acquisition for them in Europe, have you seen any changes in the marketplace over there, any customer dislocations, i.e. any risks or opportunities ahead of that?", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Art, this is David. And in Europe, it does look like that acquisition is going to be approved. And the things that I wanted to cover on that is, that we have a very strong position in Europe. We've been winning in Europe for some time now, and we've certainly have been sprinting over the last several years. We haven't changed our strategy. We're going to continue to invest and grow in Europe, and we are certainly seeing benefits of that in 2015.", "We're in the beginnings of our five-year $2 billion network investment, and we're already seeing benefits from that. And just try to give you an idea, you know that Europe is a key part of our strategy, and we've just had great momentum. We've had five consecutive quarters of double-digit operating profit. So what we're hearing from our customers is that, we continue to provide value and they continue to give us more of their share of business. So we think it's a very positive environment for us.", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International", "Art, it's Jim. I think a couple of other points on the back of what David just mentioned is that, we've talked over the last year, year and a half about the capital outlay plan of $2 billion. I think it's important to note, especially in line with our top line growth discussion, is that we've only touched 19 of our planned almost 70 facilities that we plan to expand throughout the network.", "So we won't be done until 2018. We're going to be doing that much in line with, as you pointed out, what is the customer's expectation in Europe post-merger? We've had our eyes on that for some time, obviously on the road we've traveled. And so we are kind of looking at our Customer Solution, specifically, and our network and making sure that it leans into those risks and opportunities that any merger brings forth. So we're looking forward to the years to come in Europe. Thanks.", "Operator", "Jeff Atkins (sic) [Jack Atkins], Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Andrew David Hall - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, guys. It's actually Andrew on for Jack. Richard, just going back to the International business for a second, and the impressive operating income growth there. Can you just clarify, kind of the puts and takes of that growth? How much is related to lower fuel prices and positive currency translation as opposed to the operational efficiency improvements you guys are seeing?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure, Andrew. First, let me start by saying that, I had mentioned that, even adjusting out currency; we're talking about almost a 17% operating margin. So it's a very positive, and it's actually the best margin in the industry. The other big thing to remember is, and we talked about it, I think, in my talk a little bit, was that, when you look at the yields for International, it was the strongest yields we've seen in quite some time, both in the non-U.S. Domestic and in the International exports as well.", "And your question also mentioned fuel. And let me also remind you that, we don't use fuel as a profit center. So it does impact the revenue line. But there's really not a big impact to what happens on bottom line.", "This quarter is really about great cost control, and the quality of revenue, and it was really something that Jim and his folks started mid last year, when we took on some revenue management initiatives, and we know we'll wrap that in the second half of the year. We guided that way at the beginning of the year. And so, this was really a very balanced profit picture, and a return for the quarter for International.", "Operator", "Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer.", "Unknown Speaker", "Good morning, guys. This is (46:33) for Scott. Premium product is growing faster than non-premium products, can you elaborate on the drivers there, and what you expect going forward?", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah. Hey, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so, as you stated, our premium Next Day Air products grew more than 3%, and I think, part of that is, the customer is responding and enjoying to our continual expansion of our Next Day Air and our Next Day Air Early, as well as our Express services that David talked to in his opening comments. We certainly are establishing a beachhead there, a leadership beachhead in Express and premium Next Day Air.

I know it's only April, but as we look out to 2017, can you remind us of how much of the FX hedge protection that you had in 2015 and 2016 is going to roll-off next year? Just how should we think about the impact of the loss of some of those hedges from a sensitivity perspective? Either if that's looking at your International segment margins, or maybe an overall EPS impact on the company?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure. This is Richard again. And the first thing I want to remind everyone is that, we do use a multi-year hedge strategy, and it's worked very well for the last two years. And underlying that is really the strength of our business, because the core business is running very well.", "Right now, we're in the middle of a process. We continue to look at different opportunities because of the volatility of currency, to go in and do different hedging, to protect and minimize the change. It's really a little too early to talk about what it's going to be, because we're still in the middle of that. And then, yes, we know that euro went from $1.35 down to today's rates, but we're also looking at what other initiatives across the entire enterprise we can move forward to offset some of that.

Please go ahead.", "Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on an earlier economic question. Is there any way to break down how much of the adjusted 7% to 11% EPS growth you're expecting this year comes from kind of external macro-like factors, versus some of the internal yield and profit efficiency things you're doing? Just to get a better sense of maybe how much of the growth story is within your own control, kind of despite what happens in the macro environment?", "Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure. So, when we make our guidance at the beginning of the year, and we monitor as the year goes, we have a certain assumption for what's going to happen with economic indicators, and they have come down. If you go back to January, and you look at what GDP was doing and what expectations were around the globe, those have all come down.", "On the other side, what's happening in UPS, and what we're seeing is the continued margin expansion, the things that we talked about in both International and Domestic, around both from a cost and network efficiency standpoint, as well as making the adjustments, as the volume looks different.", "So today, I'd say it's more about what's happening at UPS, but we also have to continue to think about what's happening externally because that does have an impact. But because one is a little bit better than it was going to be at the beginning of the year, and the other is a little weaker, you put it together and we think, where we're having guidance is the right place.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And this is, David. Just to reinforce, Rich. It's nice to have tailwinds. And obviously, you'd prefer not to have headwinds, but that's not the world we live in. But what we have been able to do, over the past five quarters or so, is to deal with the hands that we have dealt, and make the most of it. And our management team, throughout the world, is focused on absolutely that. And what's important, is that we stay disciplined and focused on our strategic initiatives.

Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, David, this is Myron. It's not unusual to see some of the recent headlines that have been pretty robust on behalf of the pilots. But let me assure you that there is no real threat of a strike. We remain, along with the pilots union, at the bargaining table, and we believe, as usual, that there will be a win-win negotiation at the end of this for both the pilots and UPS.", "And also, as a reminder, we're at that negotiating table with the National Mediation Board, and it would take action on their behalf to release both parties in order to have something happen. And the reality is that's not going to happen any time soon. So we're going to get this thing done.", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International", "David, it's Jim. On the Cologne situation, just a couple of points I'd like to reinforce. First of all, there's work stoppages that happens, or manifestations, as they might be called, in the world, especially in Europe, that we have to deal with day-in, day-out in our business.", "This specific situation, to be very clear, Verdi's stance in Germany in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia was really not even in the logistics sector, it was in the government sector, which has a whole another set of views to it. The IPA and the pilots took their stance on that. Our job is to run the network. And I would tell you, over the last 48 hours, the guys have done a heck of a job over there. Just like the last time the ash cloud appeared and that power of the ground and the air network came through. And tonight, our network will be just as normal.

And also, how you see the omnichannel retail shift as a potential opportunity or threat just being a general disrupter in the e-commerce channel? Thanks.", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah. Hey, Ravi, this is Alan. As you guys know, we've been in the same-day business for a long time with Express Critical and our world-class service parts logistics network, but certainly there's a lot of buzz with e-commerce with same-day, and the real challenge is obviously low-cost e-commerce delivery because the consumers are looking for a low-cost option there.", "Currently, as you know, same-day for e-commerce has challenges with consolidating density and single-piece stop economics that could create profitability issues as these companies look for the low-cost model. Deliv's goal is pretty unique. It consolidates multiple deliveries on one driver with pickups from multiple stores at a mall, for example. So we're looking to get some key learnings there. So we made that SEF investment in Deliv to better understand the economics, demand and value proposition, and certainly they are a leader in that particular space.", "At the same time, we believe that because the lion's share of shopping takes place in the late afternoon and evenings, there's much more demand for local next-day, which really speaks to the latter part of your question about omnichannel. And we're very focused on those local store solutions that enable us to take evening orders that are dropped to these stores. Let the stores fulfill them locally that same evening, and with the UPS late-night pickup, we can get next-day or morning delivery. So we can make the delivery in as little as 10 hours to 12 hours from the time the order is dropped into checkout. And you combine that again with our industry-leading e-commerce platform, and we're really leading the way in the B2C e-commerce market.

Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time here. I'm not sure how many employees at UPS are minimum-wage employees, but there's been some moves, especially in California, to push the minimum wage up.

Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller", "Sure. This is Richard. And I think the one thing that's important to understand about UPS is that many of our wages are part of our national bargaining agreement. So there are very few employees where the start rate would be at something that would be affected by the minimum wage change.", "That being said, in some states where there's a slight change, it would impact only the people that are first coming on to the payroll with UPS, because there's a progression schedule. So it's a very small impact. We've looked at it, and I'm talking hundreds of thousands of dollars kind of thing, because it's just not something that is our value proposition as an employer, and giving the full benefits and the rates we pay aren't things that are going to drive additional cost for this in any meaningful way.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Piggybacking on the e-commerce question, which had come up basically two prior to me from Ravi, if I think about the local delivery opportunity from a UPS perspective, historically I've always thought of that as a tougher market to compete in, particularly when there's some crowd sourcing opportunities, given your cost structure. Could you talk a little bit about the attractiveness or not of that marketplace from your perspective? And more broadly, what are the markets that you think make the most sense to attack from an e-commerce perspective, given your returns and margin profile?", "Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah. Hey, this is Alan and thanks for the question. Look, it's really about the whole e-commerce platform at UPS, but certainly all of our brick and mortar retailers are also in the e-commerce business. So it's about providing them a total solution. And omnichannel is a growing trend in the retail industry. We're seeing 30% year-over-year growth in UPS accounts in 2015, and that means at the store level, we've got about 120,000 ship from store locations that are shipping or have the potential to ship.", "We're starting to see this phenomena start to take place also outside the U.S. in our International business. So we think it's a real advantage for the retailers to optimize for a number of things. Sometimes it's inventory, saving the order, because the order is not in the e-commerce fulfillment center, but it's in the store. Other times, it's to speed up the delivery, other times it's to get to the lowest cost option.", "So it's really about the whole platform that we offer with UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point, omnichannel, the SurePost, Returns, marketplace tools we provide, so on and so forth, that we're out there selling along with, with obviously, the power of our whole product portfolio aligned to the integrated network that's really driving that success.", "And I guess, the last thing I'd say is that, to kind of one of the questions earlier, where \u2013 about density creation. We're really creating this density synthetically through all of those e-commerce solutions that I just spoke of, because all of them both drive customer and consumer convenience as well as density for UPS. And you combine that with some of the things we're doing on the efficiency side with ORION and automation and things that Myron talked, about, we really believe we've got a great platform for e-commerce, for both \u2013 for retailers, consumers and to continue to enhance UPS profitability.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Time constraints; that was our last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our panelists for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, gentlemen.", "David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. This is David. I'd just like to review quickly, UPS had another excellent first quarter. We are very effectively implementing our strategic initiatives and we're investing in new capabilities in the right places, which will ensure that we remain the world's premier logistics provider.", "Lastly, though, I would like to make an announcement that would be interesting to many of the people on this call. Joe Wilkins will move into the role of Vice President and Corporate Controller and Scott Childress will replace Joe as the Vice President and Investor Relations Officer.", "I'll speak to myself and the company, we are very fortunate to have two very extraordinarily, qualified and seasoned professionals, and I'm confident that each of them will be just as successful in their new roles as they have been in their prior roles. So really would like to congratulate Joe and Scott. I appreciate what you guys have done, and I'd like to thank everyone on the call for joining us today.

Sir, the floor is yours.", "Scott Childress", "Good morning and welcome to the UPS second quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with the International President Jim Barber, President of U.S. Operations Myron Gray and Chief Commercial Officer Alan Gershenhorn. Before we begin I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we will make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of our Company.

Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.", "Thanks for your cooperation. Now I will turn the call over to David.", "David Abney", "Thanks, Scott and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results that demonstrate the power of UPS' diversified business model. Again this quarter the International segment led the way. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. Domestic business is growing operating profit on higher B2C demand. Supply Chain & Freight continued to execute in a challenging macroenvironment. Turning to the economy, the consumer market in the U.S. remains healthy and e-commerce forecasts have been elevated for 2016. And we're seeing that growth.", "On the other hand, our B2B volume is affected by the continuing weakness in industrial production. In fact, global GDP and industrial production growth forecast have been downgraded slightly. Delayed inventory drawdowns and soft export demand likely will remain headwinds in the latter part of 2016. Additionally, we're mindful of the current political commentary on trade. Increased trade not only bolsters business but also produces jobs here in the U.S. and abroad. Historically, following ratification of trade deals we have seen about a 20% increase in U.S. exports to the countries involved. UPS is a steadfast proponent of trade and supports agreements that minimize friction in the global supply chain. Trade legislation to accelerate economic expansion like the Trans-Pacific Partnership is vital to the health of the U.S. economy. We encourage our political leaders to support and pass pending trade legislation.", "Turning to our business, the strategic initiatives implemented over the last two years are ensuring we remain on track to achieve our long term financial goals. We continue investing in four priority areas. We're adding network capacity, achieving greater efficiency through technology, deploying industry-specific solutions and expanding in high-growth markets. In Europe we have completed about one-fourth of the projects associated with our $2 million capital investment plan. During the second quarter we announced new automated facilities in Belgium and France.", "In addition, we began an extensive program that would dramatically improve time-in-transit in our intra-Europe ground network with some trade lanes improving by as much as two business days. The majority of the benefits of these investments are still ahead of us and will guarantee our position as a market leader in Europe for many years to come. We're also investing heavily in our U.S. operations and in a few minutes Richard will update you on our technology and capacity projects. A pillar of our strategy in the U.S. is deploying industry-leading e-commerce capabilities that help online retailers take advantage of consumer trends.", "We recently released the fifth annual U.S. Pulse of the Online Shopper study that highlights some of these changing trends. This year's survey revealed that most shoppers prefer home delivery while also expressing an interest in an alternative delivery location. To provide more delivery options, UPS is expanding our Access Point locker program in several major U.S. markets. These automated pickup locations augment our more than 8,000 existing U.S. retail locations in the more than 25,000 Access Points worldwide. We're providing more convenient alternatives for urban online shoppers.", "New technology features were also introduced for the 24 million My Choice users in the U.S. For example, members can now use the Follow My Delivery feature to track their package using real-time maps. These new capabilities are unique solutions to create value for our customers and further differentiate their online offering.", "Our investments are broad-based and targeted for the needs of customers in multiple industries. This quarter we announced a specialized set of global services for healthcare companies performing clinical trials and in Europe we expanded our field stocking locations for medical device distributors. UPS healthcare customers are gaining additional alternatives for shipping their sensitive materials globally with the assurance of our guaranteed services.", "UPS also launched a market-leading partnership with SAP and Fast Radius to support end-to-end 3D printing solutions. This capability is linked to more than 60 UPS Store locations and the urgent delivery capabilities of the UPS network. This partnership is enabling UPS to expand into an adjacent market with great growth potential. We entered another adjacent industry in 2015 with the acquisition of asset-light, truckload brokerage services of Coyote Logistics. The combination of Coyote's capabilities and the UPS integrated network is providing customers with unmatched flexibility.", "Next month will mark the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. The synergies in procurement, asset utilization and cross-selling remain on track to achieve our 2017 targets. In fact, cross-selling has already produced several great wins. ", "Before I turn it over to Richard I want to take a moment to recognize a milestone we will achieve in August. UPS marks our 40th year in Germany and our entrance into Europe. Over that time our business has matured rapidly and the European operations have become a cornerstone for our integrated network. Today we operate in every European country generating more than $6 billion in annual revenue using our best-in-class pan-European network. The expansion in Europe and the growth of our business around the world are made possible through the hard work and dedication of UPSers. As our strong momentum carries into the second half of the year I want to thank all of our employees around the globe for helping make and maintain UPS as the market leader.", "Now Richard will review the financial highlights.", "Richard Peretz", "Thanks, David. The second quarter operating results demonstrate the value of our flexible business model as we had another solid quarter. Additionally, we're seeing high-growth in the e-commerce and healthcare sectors while the LTL and forwarding markets remain challenged. Even with these dynamics currency-neutral revenue growth increased 4% while fuel surcharges were a drag of around 120 basis points. Second quarter earnings per share were in line with expectations. Our performance reflected the gains from our investment strategies despite the mixed macroenvironment. The International segment outperformed while U.S. Domestic was on target. And finally, Supply Chain & Freight was slightly below expectations.", "Now for some details by segment, U.S. Domestic revenue increased 2.4% as lower fuel surcharges reduced total revenue growth by about 100 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.5% led by Next Day Air products which were up about 6%. The Next Day Air gains were produced by customers of all sizes. Demand was consumer-based as more online retailers are providing faster delivery options to stay competitive. During the quarter Ground products increased 2.4% over last year as B2C expansion outpaced B2B by more than 5 to 1. Base rates accelerated slightly from last quarter. Lower fuel surcharges reduced yield growth by about 100 basis points.", "The higher base rates were able to compensate for some of the changes in product and customer mix. Operating profit increased about 3% and operating margin expanded to 13.7%. Enhanced productivity and lower fuel cost resulted in operating cost per piece declining 2/10 of a percent. Once again we're seeing good improvements in our daily operating statistics. Despite the fact that delivery stops were up over 3% ORION lowered driver Miles by 3/10 of a percent. In addition, overall productivity gains continued as direct labor hours grew less than the volume. Our investment in ORION is bending the cost curve. And we remain on track to complete Phase 1 implementation later in 2016.", "We're continuing our multiyear investment strategy in hub automation in the U.S. operations. So far in 2016 we have announced new projects in California, Colorado, Illinois and Texas. These facilities are adding increased capacity and improved productivity.", "Now turning to the International segment which had another remarkable quarter with operating profit expanding more than 11%, on a two-year stacked basis operating profit is up more than 30%. Export daily volume increased almost 4% as improvements in all international regions offset slower U.S. exports. Europe led the way with significant gains in cross-border products and export growth to all regions of the world. In fact, the Europe to U.S. Lane grew at double-digit pace this quarter. Cycling out of the revenue management initiatives that we started in the last half of 2015 we have seen good non-U.S. domestic daily shipment growth which is up 4.5% while at the same time currency-neutral revenue per piece increased 1%. We saw higher base rates. However, they were offset by changes in product and trade lane mix.", "Currency-neutral revenue for the segment increased 1.5%. The lower fuel surcharge did impact revenue growth by about 170 basis points. The cost and productivity improvements held operating down during the quarter. As a result, operating margin expanded to 19.9%. The International segment had a record second quarter with its highest second quarter delivery volume, operating profit and one of the best margins ever.", "Now let's turn and look at Supply Chain & Freight. Total revenue increased more than 13% due to the addition of Coyote Logistics. The new truckload brokerage revenue offset tonnage shortfalls in international forwarding and the U.S. LTL business. Freight Forwarding revenue and operating profits declined as we wrapped last year's rate actions. Cargo capacity continues to outpace demand, contributing to the weak market conditions I mentioned earlier. Expansion of the buy-sell rate and cost-containment efforts led to the operating margin expansion. The unit remains focused on growing the more profitable middle market.", "In the Distribution unit we experienced strong revenue growth in the healthcare, aerospace and automotive sectors this quarter. In fact, this quarter healthcare became the top revenue sector within the contract logistics business. Distribution operating profit jumped more than 10% and the margin expanded. The UPS Freight business remains disciplined on pricing with revenue per hundredweight up 3%. The unit's execution of revenue quality initiatives is driving higher shipment yields. Total tonnage was lower by about 10% due in part to the weak LTL market conditions.", "Now to update you on our cash position, for the six months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow, a 13% increase over last year. And this was after spending $1 billion on CapEx. The Company paid just over $1.3 billion in dividends, an increase of almost 7%. In addition, we purchased over 13 million shares for more than $1.3 billion. Combined we're on schedule to meet our return to shareholders goals we set for the year.", "Looking at the rest of the year, our strong International performance and the return on investments we're making in our network give us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year earnings guidance of $5.70 to $5.90 per share. As I discussed in February, we expect 2016 operating profit by quarter to follow the same pattern as it did in 2015. We still expect the fourth quarter operating profit growth to be above our annual guidance, somewhere between 9% and 11%. The additional workday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the continued strength in e-commerce and our strategic investments position us well for another solid fourth quarter.", "Looking at the segments, in the U.S. Domestic we expect strong fourth quarter results. However, we will face tough comparisons in the third as a result of one less operating day and lower Worker's Compensation cost last year. Therefore, we anticipate third quarter operating profit to be relatively flat year over year. For the International segment we expect to continue into the second half of the year the progress we have made with operating profit growth in the 8% to 12% range. The Supply Chain & Freight segment is where we anticipate the current market trends in International Air Freight and the U.S. trucking markets to remain soft. In addition, lower fuel surcharges will weigh on reported revenue growth. Therefore, total annual revenue growth for the segment should be around 10%.", "Now let's look at taxes. The faster growth of our profits from the International segment means that we will have a slightly lower tax rate in 2016. In summary, UPS' financial performance this year clearly demonstrates the value of our diverse business. We're embracing the opportunities created by the evolution of the global e-commerce marketplace as it expands beyond the traditional retail base.", "We continue investing in strategic technologies, systems and expanded capacity and by our execution we're strengthening our leadership position. At the halfway point of the year our business is responding well to the changing macroenvironment and we're confident about the remainder of 2016.", "Thanks for your attention today. Now I will ask the operator to open the line. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter", "I just want to follow-up. Richard, thanks for the overview on the International side there. And the strength you are talking about continuing it. Maybe some of the advances you've made, you talked about advancing two days on some of the service deliveries. What is accelerating that pace and how are you achieving that operating margin gains?", "Jim Barber", "We've talked over the years about the network in Europe. David referenced it in his opening comments. I think the key to our success in Europe has been and will continue to be making sure the network and the service and product offerings are best-in-class. And so that means always maintaining the network, putting the speed in and making sure that the customers feel the benefit of that. And as you've seen over the years they have said that.", "Obviously the marketplace is changing in Europe. We know that as well, so it forces us to continue to relook and reevaluate everything we do. The margins, they've always been strong. I think I will flip it to Richard to talk a little bit about the margins, as well.", "Richard Peretz", "I do want to point out that the margin of 19.9% is very strong and it does include that multiyear hedge that we've talked about on the call the last few quarters. So I want to remind you that even adjusting for that we're still over a 17.5% margin which is the highest of any player in the industry. And along that route if you recall the currency we've been using a multiyear hedge strategy and what happened is in 2015 you saw a lot of volatility and the euro go to the dollar from $1.35 down to $1.11. So 2017 will be a transition year where we expect to have somewhere around $300 million impact for the change in the currency.", "We have moved to a different hedge strategy because of the volatility has increased so much on currency where we're using more of a rolling average so that year over year going forward will not see these dips if you see a lot of volatility in currency. But overall that 17.5% is really a result of all the efforts of Jim and his folks really putting together and making adjustments in the network and at the same time the quality of revenue that we're bringing in.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee", "I wanted to ask about some of the comments around the third quarter Domestic side relative to the fourth quarter. So I'm guessing there's probably some level of investment that needs to happen in advance of TPP that you guys really start to shore up and get ready for that surge again.", "Just thinking about it on a European basis I guess I just want to make sure I understand the comment around the tougher comps from the third quarter Domestic side. Are there specific cost items that we might expect this year that we didn't have last year? I just want to make sure I understand that cadence of Domestic in 3Q and 4Q. Thank you.", "Richard Peretz", "I think the first thing to keep in mind here is that we continue to see margin expansion. Because of operating days, how holidays fall, things like that, it's not a linear movement of the expansion of the margin but over the year to year we have kind of guided that we continue to see improvement and expect to see improvement going forward, as well. When you look at the third quarter specifically, there is one less workday and that does have an impact, as well as last year we had some Worker's Comp. credits that won't repeat this coming year. So when you take all of that into account you have to look at and we did at the beginning of year understanding how the quarters would look and what we saw is that we need to make sure that you guys had some transparency to understand that workday shifts some of the profit around.", "And if you look at this quarter this quarter we had a good improvement and that improvement was really driven by the operational improvements. Even though we saw so much volatility in fuel this year in the second quarter, we actually saw a 25% increase in fuel from April to June. So we were chasing the revenue. But when you step back and look at what we expect for the fourth quarter we're going to have a strong fourth quarter. We're putting our plans in place and we look forward to completing 2016 very much like we told you we would at the beginning of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon", "Maybe just following up on Domestic, Richard, I guess the step below trend long term guidance growth in that Domestic segment obviously going down this quarter to 3% and then an expectation for flat in 3Q.", "Maybe as you think over the course of the next sort of one, two, three years and that rate of margin change how should we be expecting that to happen to get to that longer term 15%? And what do you think is going to be different about next year and the year after that will let you get back to that kind of 8% growth that you guys have put out for a long term target in Domestic?", "Richard Peretz", "So, first, if we step back if you recall when we guided this year and what we've seen through the year is we have seen some softness in the macro measures. Everything has kind of come down each quarter of this year and so we take that into account, obviously, with how we think about this year. The good part about this year is even with that softness we're putting initiatives and investments in that are bringing returns. And that's why we're able to leave our guidance right where we expected to be at the first part of the year.", "That being said, we're in a multiyear process of investments both in the ORION that David talked about in his talk as well as the hub automation and how that will continue. So all of those things are about putting together the multiyear process of where we're going to improve the margin that we laid out really at the end of 2014. We're putting those investments in. Those investments are paying the return we expected. And we just expect as we get more of that integrated into our network we will continue to see the benefits of that. So we feel very comfortable where we're at. We know we're on a roadmap for the next few years and we're following that roadmap.", "David Vernon", "All right. Thank you very much for the extra color on that. Thanks.", "David Abney", "Okay, this is David and we're going to take an online question. This one is from Nate Brochmann. And as a large e-commerce shipper takes over more of its own delivery within the denser cities, does that change the density equation at all and the need to retrofit all of the regional sort facilities and how is that project progressing and what have you learned thus far in terms of benefits heading into another peak? So Nate got his bang for his buck in that question. And I will start and address the first part of it, then I'm going to turn it over to Myron to talk a little bit about the retrofit and peak.", "And it's not unusual for any of our large shippers to make decisions whether they are going to outsource or in-source different parts of their business. Our focus is our diverse customer base, just makes it so difficult for any one company to be able to match our density no matter their size. So with our integrated network that creates efficiencies, we're constantly increasing our value proposition.", "So we always believe that even our large customers would have more density with us than going in another direction. So we feel very confident in our strategy from that regard. Why don't you talk about the retrofit and peak preparation, Myron?", "Myron Gray", "So Nate, the process itself is going well and we continue to realize 20% to 25% productivity improvements as we go along. Keep in mind this is a multiyear, multiphase implementation. And you've heard about some of the cities that we introduced earlier in Richard's comments. Our goal is to automate the top Tier 1 hubs and there is approximately 30 of them in the U.S. That process is as much as 60% of our volume.", "Three of those automated hubs are in our air operation and the remainder will be in the ground. All new hubs moving forward will be built using an automated design and the second phase of it will be to go to the Tier 2 hubs and automate them, as well. So we feel very good about the progress that's being made and we're on plan and a go-list to get it completed no later than 2020.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz, UBS. Please go ahead.", "Tom Wadewitz", "I wanted to ask a bit in specific about ORION. I know Richard you offered some comments on high-level multiyear productivity and so forth. But is 2017 or are you starting to see this year where there is the reduction in the rollout costs and really getting some of the cost savings coming in in a bigger way? Are you starting to see that or is that something which would be maybe a bigger support for Domestic margin performance in 2017? And then you've mentioned a Phase 2, I don't know if you want to comment on that, I know that's a couple of questions. Maybe just some perspective, a little more detail on ORION. Thank you.", "Richard Peretz", "Sure, Tom. What I will do is I will start off and then I will hand it off to Myron to talk specifically about the benefits he's seen. But when you think about the investment and when we've been on the road talking about ORION we have talked about that later this year we will complete, call it, the first phase of ORION. And then we're investing the dollars in, call it, Phases 2 and 3 and 4. But on top of that it's not just the investment in ORION, it is also the investment in hub automation and what that does to the network.", "So we're using those investment dollars and the additional expense that we were using to train up for ORION in other ways so that we get the end result. And that's kind of what we talked about at the end of 2014 and we continue to talk about each year. We're investing in our network and it's pulling through when you see the reduction in miles and things like that. But the next phase is additional capabilities that will save money and then additional features by having the hub mod and then there are some other things that we're working on, as well, that is just a little too early to go into. With that I'm going to send it to Myron to talk just a little bit about what he's seen operationally with the results of ORION.", "Myron Gray", "Tom, let me start with we expect to be 100% fully deployed by the end of 2016 with ORION. And we will continue to see the benefits that we've alluded to earlier, more than eight miles per driver in savings. For example, this quarter we saw our delivery stops growing more than 3% on 2.5% average daily volume gains. However, we were able to reduce our miles driven by 3/10 of a percent which helped keep our costs per piece down by 2/10 of a percent. So as the volume continues to grow our wages are growing at a lesser pace than the volume.", "So we're continuing to see benefits and that's Phase 1. Phase 2 will actually begin in the back half of this year, well into 2017 and we hope to have the Phase 2 completed by 2017 when we hope to see additional benefits from ORION. And, again, that's just one of many technology projects that we will continue to roll out that should help us continue to bend the cost curve, so we're real pleased with what we're seeing.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group", "Actually I just want to follow-up on the ORION question. So I understand the savings this year but there's probably some implementation cost. Can you quantify what the implementation costs are this year and if ORION has been a net positive or tailwind to earnings this year? And do you think that next year, how do you think about next year given the savings from Phase 1 but maybe the cost from Phase 2, any color there would be helpful.", "Richard Peretz", "And we're seeing the savings and if you just step back for a moment and look, year over year we continue to see the margin expansion. The margin expansion is a direct result of all the things Myron just talked about. We will continue to see those improvements. And it is a net positive but we also are spending some of the savings in order to invest in the next phase and the next capability. Those are all important pieces.", "And that's why my comment a few minutes ago about the margin will improve year over year, it won't always be linear by quarter. And so that's an important part because we're investing for new capabilities and to continue to bend the cost curve because of the investments we're making and the plans we have for the next few years.", "David Abney", "This is David. I just want to stress that ORION is one of these things that it's the gift that keeps on giving. So what we have seen with ORION is we're seeing benefits that are greater than what we originally believed and that continues to reinforce itself every year. We have a lot more we're going to accomplish through ORION with the later versions and taking it to various countries. So we're very positive about ORION of the returns that we're getting and investments that we're making are certainly worth it. All right, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski, Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski", "As we look out, can you talk about where the pricing is falling in the U.S. Domestic market and why with this tremendous growth in B2C that we're not seeing a little bit more traction on yields which I think could also talk or this discussion on Domestic margins? Because obviously we've talked a lot about cost, but what are we doing on the revenue side and is there ability to take more price?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "So for the quarter we achieved our 2% to 3% range in our base pricing and the core pricing actually remains firm. We actually saw a bit of an acceleration from the first quarter. Keep in mind that some of the other phenomena we're seeing out there is the offset of about 100 basis points due to lower fuel surcharges and we're continuing to see changes in the customers and product mix and specifically the package characteristics as we bring more lightweight into the business.", "The other thing I would say is that we saw even with some of those package characteristics and customer product mix challenges we did see margin improvement overall in the U.S. Domestic business. So we think the base rate improvements remains steady and they will continue to remain that way and core pricing right now is firm. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Just curious, here at the midpoint of the year, obviously reiterating the guidance range I'm curious looking out over the second half what do you view as the swing factors that would put you toward the high end or the low end of the range? Thanks.", "Richard Peretz", "This is Richard. I think when you start and you look at where we're at year to date first of all on earnings per share we're at about 8.5% growth in earnings per share on a target of 5% to 9%. So we're pleased with where we're for the first half of the year. We're actually right in line with where we expect it to be. But when we look at guidance there is really two factors we're looking at.", "The first is the external and what's happening on the external measures. Because our volume does have some correlation, especially when you get to B2B, to what's happening with both domestic GDP, things like industrial production and things like that. And they all have softened somewhat from first quarter to second quarter.", "The other side of it, of course, is what's happening internally, the things Myron has talked about in his operation and those improvements that we're seeing. So we put all that together and we say do we have economic assumptions are realistic and how are we benefiting from the initiatives that we have implemented. So we think we balance all that. And that is what we're seeing in 2016, we're seeing a nice balance where we're making up for some softness externally with what we're doing internally. And that's allowed us to grow our earnings per share for six quarters in a row and we will continue to work those plans for guidance going forward.", "David Abney", "So just to add to Richard's answer, it's our investments and strategies that have allowed us to offset some of this economic shifts that we've seen in the last year and a half. And we feel very comfortable about our strategic initiatives. We're extremely focused on them and it's allowing us to overcome some of those headwinds. We'll take the next question. We will do an online question. This is from Helane Becker. And it's are you seeing any signs of weakness in the UK related to anything including Brexit? Jim?", "Jim Barber", "So David, thanks for that one and Helane, as well. I think I get this question every day quite frankly over the last couple of months. But to give you a little bit of backdrop on it I go back and just remind you of something here. Back in 2008 when we bought LYNX it was our choice in the UK to strengthen that market, to feed the network we talk about a lot and obviously also feed that country and the consumers.", "It took us a couple of years to get it done. We were done in 2010 and although we don't talk much about country-level performance I think this question will get us pretty close to it. I could just tell you that from the years 2010 through 2015 that UK operation for us is best-in-class in many ways that we measure our business. So that acquisition and integration that took us about three years has paid dividends for many, many, many years now. Brexit we don't see changing that for that market, quite frankly. Our job is to continue that priority, number one, to take care of that economy and the consumers, our employees and the shareholders and link it into that European network. So that is priority one.", "The issue obviously becomes what the free-trade agreement is set up to be. Don't forget a couple of things from my perspective, one is there are many, there's a number of free-trade agreements in that union, as well. You've got the Norway model, you have got the Swiss model and you've got the EU model. So how it unfolds we will see but there are various models that could unfold. We've analyzed scenarios as far left as the WTO setup all the way back to something close to what they have today.", "In the end I think our priority is to advise and advocate and support consumers at the free-trade agreements are finalized in the coming years and then continue to whatever happened support that market in the network. I think we could easily say there will be somewhat more complexity but I think our job is to simplify the complex in a network for consumers and continue the great service. And that's what we plan to do as that unfolds.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford, Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben Hartford", "Just wondering what your point of view is today on the acquisition environment as you start to lap the Coyote acquisition. Obviously taking into account what you've said historically about acquisition criteria, are there specific segments or verticals that you're more interested in?", "And I guess I'm leading you into UPS Freight in particular given some of the softness that we see in that LTL market. Do you think that business is a sufficient scale today or are there potential acquisition opportunities in that segment specifically? Thanks.", "David Abney", "And I will answer the first part and then you talked a little bit about Coyote so I will ask Alan to briefly hit that and then the LTL environment and Myron will take that. From an acquisition standpoint we have an active process and we're really looking in what I will call just three general buckets that we're always taking a look at. First is new opportunities, new opportunities that would help us to add more value to our customers. And then anytime that we can expand capability within our network, so if it's something that we don't feel as strong about as we'd like to then that would be that second criteria.", "And then third, the trade lanes are shifting throughout the world and so geographic presence is always important. Over the last few years the emerging markets has been a place that we've put a lot of attention on.", " So adjacent markets which is what we did with the Coyote acquisition, is key on our mind. But at the end of the day whether it's organic growth or its inorganic growth our focus is on growing this business and at the same time having profitable returns. So, from a Coyote standpoint, Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Just a quick update on Coyote, certainly their customers and our customers and new customers are responding very well to the new Coyote and UPS combined value prop. For the quarter we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in loads and our gross margin has also expanded for the quarter. As I think we all know the truckload market remained soft but certainly this asset-light model has provided some great flexibility in the up-and-down cycles.", "And then just lastly, I will say that as far as the synergies related to the acquisition we're seeing some good work happening there in procurement, asset utilization, cross-selling and then organizational synergies that are benefiting both Coyote and also our U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain & Freight segments and we're on track. And I guess I will turn it over to Myron to talk a little bit about the LTL.", "Myron Gray", "Ben, as you are well aware the LTL market for the last 16 consecutive months has experienced softness. And our customer base is telling us that they have high inventory levels. In addition to that with high inventory levels the opportunity for restocking is soft as well. All those things considered, we believe that we have the appropriate scale at UPS Freight. We will have and continue to monitor the market and make the appropriate adjustments and make the right business decisions moving forward in terms of whether or not to expand our scale. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison Landry", "Could you speak a little more to your earlier comments about U.S. consumer interest in alternative delivery methods? I wanted to understand how well penetrated it is even in the urban areas and specifically how much you think it would need to increase from here in order to move the needle on density. Thank you.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "This is Alan. There are a number of things, first of all, that we're doing to improve density. And it's really part of the whole e-commerce value proposition and ecosystem that we've put in place. The UPS Access Points, UPS My Choice, the Synchronized Delivery Solutions and certainly SurePost Redirect which is now at about the 30% of those packages are being redirected back into the Ground network.", "On Access Points right now we will probably finish the year at about 27,000 Access Points globally and we continue to expand there. So when you think about bending the cost curve, I guess the 1/10 contributes to about $200 million in bottom-line cost if we when we increase the density by 1/10. And then I guess the last thing I will say is we continue to be bullish about Access Points and we're expanding the current model. And as you probably saw we invested in our locker expansion after some tests we ran last year and we're laying in 300 lockers into the United States.", "And your point about urban America and urban anywhere in the world, lots of consumers out there have challenges receiving packages at home in urban areas and the Access Points and the lockers is a great solution for them and it also benefits UPS.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Ross, Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Ross", "You talked a lot about the U.S. and also about Europe. Can you talk a little bit more about Asia and the rest of the world and what you're seeing going on there from a trade perspective?", "Jim Barber", "Certainly the Asia market it also continues to change. It's the biggest market out there from a China perspective, we currently quite frankly are seeing very, very nice and actually momentum picking up in our middle-market growth based upon the solutions we're providing to the Chinese consumer as their model shifts at the same time. Certainly the network that we have in place has served us well for many years. This quarter overall I think the block hours were down about 0.5%.", "You saw in the early opening comments of the call this morning and the releases that the export volume continues to grow at UPS. That includes our Asia-Pacific region as well as our Latin America region at the same time. So we continue on. One of our big focuses out there is our intra-Asia network. It's a great opportunity for us. We laid that in in 2010.", "We think it has lots more upside. We will continue to do that and really align that, as well, to the emerging markets strategy that David just referenced a minute ago that we continue to invest in and I'm confident we will be referencing on the calls to come. So I appreciate the question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins, Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins", "So I was wondering if you could expand for a moment on your comments around B2B trends. You referenced in the press release that B2C group grew five times that of B2B but could you maybe comment exactly what the growth rate was for B2B in the quarter, what portion of your U.S. Domestic Package business B2B makes up now and what customer verticals are you seeing particular strength and weakness on the B2B side? Thank you.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "On the commercial B2B side we did see a slight increase. The good news is we've seen a slight increase the last few quarters there. It's mainly being driven actually by the retail sector and returns but we're seeing some growth in some other areas. Wholesale, healthcare and professional services are some of the other areas and then also consumer and home goods. As you know industrial production, as David indicated, was pretty soft and B2B is really being driven now by retail and some of those other sectors that I have spoken about.", "I think our investments really in some of these sectors including healthcare are helping us gain share in that particular area. So kind of outrun the economic challenges. Then, lastly, our B2C business is about 45% of our business today.", "David Abney", "Okay, the next question will come from online. And the question and this was from the buy side, is do you see any long term opportunities to expand streamlined delivery routes with the ride sharing programs. So Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "I think again everyone knows on a call that we made a strategic enterprise fund investment a few quarters back in a company named Deliv which is a retail-to-consumer same-day B2C delivery company that actually uses the excess capacity out there in the market with people that have vehicles that want to participate in that program, similar to what's happening on the ride sharing part of the economy there. They are a leader in this new space and we're excited to learn more from that.", "The other thing I would say is that Coyote is really a technology platform that's doing the same thing. It's matching up excess capacity in the marketplace from thousands upon thousands of carriers that have backhaul excess capacity and we're providing a similar service with Coyote. So we're excited about that in the heavier truckload type business as well as for prospects potentially on the pickup and delivery side.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty, Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Kelly Dougherty", "I just wanted to think about the U.S. domestic volume growth. Obviously it seems like prime are driving demand for more premium products, but would love to get some insight on how other retails are pursuing e-commerce, if they are offering free shipping on some or all spending levels. Do you expect that will show up more in your Deferred offerings? That certainly didn't seem to be the case this quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense of what you think the volume and maybe the revenue mix will be as e-commerce grows.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "A couple of points on your question. First the holiday offerings here in July were pretty widespread amongst a whole number of retailers. And I think we will see more and more of that, certainly in this summer time frame but also in other parts of the year, to drive growth in the e-commerce sector for these retailers which is critically important for them.", "Certainly the e-commerce growth drives significant growth in our Ground business and our SurePost business and then on the overnight and Deferred side mainly in the Saver and the Second Day Air business. But the key here is that we've got this great portfolio, so when a customer absolutely has to have it they are usually willing to pay for that and we have the full gamut of services to get those goods to them when they want it and we have the more economical alternatives along with some of the value ads like UPS Access Point, UPS My Choice and omnichannel that really drive those retailers and those consumers to UPS. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Rob Salmon", "I guess this is a piggybacking on Kelly's question. Can you walk us through some of the factors that were impacting U.S. Domestic Package Deferred volume and yield trends which have diverged a little bit from the rest of the U.S. Domestic portfolio with volumes down a little bit but yields up year on year? And if you could specifically address if we're seeing the impact of any large customers changing their delivery methodologies that are impacting Deferred trends?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "First, our premium Next Day Air products grew at nearly 6% and the Ground was up more than 2%. So certainly our customers are responding to the continual expansion of our Next Day Air and our Next Day Early service to more postal codes. In fact, all of our Next Day Air services experienced growth.", "On the other hand, Saver, Ground and SurePost and certainly Deferred are focused more on the e-commerce and retail customers. And so on the Deferred side you really need to look at it on a two-year stacked basis we almost grew 15% following strong double-digit growth in 2015. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "And the last question in queue at this time will come from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ravi Shanker", "I'm going to try and squeeze in two follow-ups if I can. The first one is on 2017, so between the FX hedges rolling off and the Ground growth costs do you think EBIT can be higher in 2017 versus 2016? And the second question is on Amazon do you feel like your delivery share with them has held constant or is it up or down in the last 12 months?", "Richard Peretz", "This is Richard and I will start with the first question on the guidance for 2017. I think the important thing is as we had said that as we move forward we have continued initiatives that will continue to improve the operating margin. That being said obviously different segments things will happen and growth rates might have to be adjusted. It's a little early to talk about exactly what's going to happen. And that's really because there's a lot of things going on in volatility of currency, too. So the year here we're in end of July we have time still and if you tell me where in November the dollar/euro is or the sterling/dollar that will be a lot about the story of how much variation, that's why we say the plus or minus numbers.", "An important thing is that we have a plan, it will improve by segment. Our first priority is to reinvest in this business because of the strength of the Company. We continue to deliver the highest ROIC and the highest margins in the business and our plan is to continue to do that. We will continue to do that while at the same time having dividends of over 3% or around 3%. So as we get closer to the 2017 I will guide you appropriately but we're in the middle of putting all those plans together.", "And your second question around the percentage of our share of any one customer is something that we obviously continue to win customers based on our strategy to win customers. We don't comment on any one customer but you can see our volume growth for the U.S. was up about 2.5%.", "You adjust for fuel we saw revenue growth about 3.4%, so it was a strong quarter. We laid out for you how we think the fourth quarter is going to look and that's another strong quarter. And we're going to end up delivering on the guidance numbers that we gave you at the beginning of the year and I think that's the most important thing.", "David Abney", "Okay, we have one last question and this is an online question from Tyler Brown. And it's about return logistics, reverse logistics and kind of two parts. Could you talk about what kind of growth rates you're seeing in return volumes? And talk a little bit about our capabilities on this front and do we need to do something to add to our capabilities. So Alan, if you would take that.", "Alan Gershenhorn", "As I said earlier returns growth has been strong, it's in the mid-teens. And as you all know returns is very good business for us because customers tend to drop those packages off, so we have high density pickups at those drop-off locations and then high density deliveries back to the retailers. UPS has some of the most technology-advanced transportation return services with things like Returns on the Web, RS1, RS3 print label return.", "So when it comes to label generation, shipping, tracking, visibility, enabling speedy refunds for the consumers for customer experience we've got some of the best returns solutions in the business. Combine that with the UPS Stores, the UPS Access Points, the lockers, the other alliance partners, UPS drop boxes, there are millions of packages being returned or being delivered to those drop-off locations casting that wide net. And again I just tie that back to the whole e-commerce ecosystem that we have that really benefits retailers and consumers and makes UPS the e-commerce transportation Company of choice. Thanks to the question.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir.", "Scott Childress", "Thanks, Stephen. I want to thank everyone for submitting an online question today and for your interest in UPS. If you submitted a question that did not get answered please reach out to the investor relations team or myself after the call. Now I will turn the call to David for his closing comments. David?", "David Abney", "So UPS performed well in the second quarter. We expanded our margins in our International and in our Domestic small package business. And very importantly we're investing today to ensure our future performance. So we're at the halfway point of the year. So to UPSers, this is half-time.", "And we have had a good first half, we were on plan but it's very important and we're all committed to our plans and confident in our 2016 guidance. So on behalf of the 435,000 UPSers around the world, thank you for your time today and for all of you thank you for investing in UPS. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "That does conclude our call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours. Please go ahead.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Good morning, and welcome to the UPS third quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Office, Alan Gershenhorn.

Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our performance and happy to report another quarter of solid UPS earnings. These results demonstrate increased demand for our products and disciplined execution of our initiatives. I'll provide an update of our Q3 highlights, and then Kate will give you an update on peak season.", "During Q3, International segment increased operating profit by 14% or more than 7% package volume growth. Our International strategy is achieving outstanding results. This was seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit expansion. Yes. I said seven consecutive quarters of International operating profit growth.", "The U.S. Domestic business produced higher than anticipated package volume, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of ecommerce solutions. We continued to see increase demand for our air products, and this was quarter was no exception. Shippers are choosing UPS air products because our value is a differentiator.", "The Supply Chain and Freight segment is navigating prolonged weak market conditions. They're making progress in adapting their business model and focusing on capturing the right revenue opportunities. We're confident in our long-term strategies, and as a result of our performance this quarter, we remain on plan with this year's guidance.", "Turning now to the economy, where global growth has continued to be modest. In the U.S., consumer fundamentals remain healthy and account for most of the economic expansion while the outlook for industrial production remains weak. Overall, global GDP forecasts are slightly down. For the balance of 2016, we continue to see mixed economic signals across some industrial markets. Under these conditions, our diversified business model and our winning strategies still enable UPS to take advantage of high-growth markets such as cross-border trade and ecommerce.", "To facilitate growth, we're adding capacity and increasing efficiency in our globally integrated network. Trade lane and product portfolio enhancements are important components of our plans. We have significantly improved time in transit from several cities in the U.S. to Canada based on increased export opportunities. We have also dramatically improved service times for cross-border shipments between several major European cities.", "During the quarter, we strengthened our portfolio of urgent delivery options by expanding our Worldwide Express Plus product. We've doubled the number of countries served and are now reaching 90% of the world's GDP by the next day.", "We've also expanded solutions for specialized shippers by strengthening our clinical trial service used by pharmaceutical companies. We see excellent opportunities for growth in this part of the healthcare segment. Our actions are providing more delivery options, faster transit times and earlier guaranteed deliveries, helping UPS customers achieve their growth objectives.", "In addition, we're following a disciplined capital approach to invest in our business. In 2016, we announced 12 highly-automated facility upgrades as part of our multiyear strategy, and we plan to announce several significant new projects before the end of the year. These projects will help us to increase operating efficiency while simultaneously better serving our customers. Expectations in the ecommerce sector and specialized markets like healthcare logistics have continued to ship to faster delivery options. As a result, demand for both domestic and international air products has been strong. Since we took delivery of our last new plane in 2013, UPS air products have increased more than 15%. Clearly, over the last several years UPS has expanded market share in the Air segment, and we expect these trends to continue.", "In response, we're announcing the purchase of 14 Boeing 747-8 jumbo freighters along with options to buy 14 more in the future. We will take delivery of the first two at the end of 2017. This is a net add to our fleet. These new 747s will enable UPS to begin a cascade of aircraft route assignments that will add significant capacity in our busiest lanes. This will optimize global air network capacity well beyond the impact of adding these new cargo jets. All of these investments are aligned to meet expanding customer needs and produce positive financial returns.", "Looking now at the upcoming holiday season, we have created extensive peak season plans and built a foundation for another successful holiday for our customers and share owners. Our strategy is to follow the same framework outlined last year. It's the four Cs: collaboration, capacity, control and commitment.", "To conclude, I want to recognize the hard-working and dedicated UPSers around the world for the progress we've made year-to-date and to thank them in advance for their commitment to another successful peak season.", "And now Kate will update you on our peak plans.", "Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks David, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to review our 2016 peak season plans with you. The dramatic growth of online shopping and subsequent returns is expected to lift UPS package levels to a record high during this upcoming holiday period. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve 2016, there are two additional operating days and we expect to complete over 700 million deliveries worldwide, about 100 million more than last year.", "In the overall U.S. market, the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales to increase 3.6%. They're also estimating non-store retail sales growth between 7% and 10%. At UPS, our peak strategies are focused on executing the four Cs that David mentioned earlier. To begin with, we've deepened the level of collaboration with even more customers. We started earlier, and are communicating more frequently. This better aligns UPS solutions and capacity with their seasonal promotion plans and fulfillment strategies, helping customers shift demand, sell inventory earlier, and optimize their operations. Customer experience continues to gain importance in the marketplace, making collaboration a shared objective for both shippers and UPS. Whether you're in healthcare, retail or any industry, our work together is creating consumer loyalty and a preference for the UPS delivery experience.", "Looking at our second area of focus, capacity, UPS customers will benefit from several key automation and expansion projects. We've opened new automated facilities and updated existing hubs in the U.S. and Europe in cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris and London. In the U.S., we are supplementing our capacity with the addition of temporary facilities. These investments in technology and capacity make our integrated network more flexible and efficient. This peak, our partners at Coyote Logistics will be supporting our entire domestic operation, helping UPS solve customer needs during this high demand period.", "In addition, our driver dispatch will be even more effective. I'm pleased to announce that we've completed Phase 1 of the ORION implementation in the U.S. ahead of schedule. 100% of eligible U.S. drivers will be utilizing this dispatch technology during peak, up from 70% last year.", "The third focus area is control, both control of deliveries for UPS customers and control of the UPS network. UPS My Choice will provide greater control to 30 million global members, an increase of 10 million from last year. My Choice enables members to exert preferences with their inbound UPS shipment and take action on their packages when desired. They can choose to redirect deliveries to alternate delivery locations, including a UPS Access Point location. In fact this year, we've expanded our reach and will have over 27,000 convenient Access Point locations open around the world, with approximately 8,000 in the U.S.", "Looking at the UPS network, we are exercising real-time control to ensure our customers can properly respond to peak demand, and one important tool we use is the UPS control tower. This decision-making body enables us to say yes to more customer requests, leveraging the flexibility of our operations to accept volume surges when possible. It also assures that our capacity, value, cost to serve and price are appropriately aligned throughout peak season.", "The final area of focus for UPS is commitment. The 450,000 UPS employees, together with 95,000 temporary hires, will be working diligently to provide world-class value and service during this upcoming holiday season. Each year, the needs of peak season create special memories for all UPSers. Last year, I had a chance to visit the building I started in 27 years ago. The same energy, determination and customer focus that I was drawn to day one was clear in everyone I met. Spending time making deliveries really reinforced to me how the peak planning and collaboration with customers resonates throughout the entire organization.", "Thank you for your time today. And I want to assure you that the UPS team is ready to deliver another successful peak season. Now I'll turn it over to Richard.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, Kate. UPS performed as we projected this quarter, with total reported revenue up about 5% and daily shipments up almost 6%. The International segment produced another quarter of double-digit profit expansion. And U.S Domestic delivered results as we had anticipated, while Supply Chain and Freight results were somewhat below expectations.", "UPS third quarter earnings per share were up about 4%. In 2016, the EPS change across the enterprise was lowered by headwinds in the U.S. Domestic business and approximately $0.02 due to discrete tax credits taken in 2015. This was a good quarter. UPS generated strong topline revenue, great momentum in our International business, and solid results from the other segments.", "Now for a closer look at how the segments performed. U.S. Domestic revenue increased 4.8%, driven by daily package gains of 5.7%. All products contributed to volume growth, with Deferred Air up more than 10%, Next Day Air up almost 6%, and Ground up 5.2%. Growth was balanced from enterprise and middle-market customers. High demand for online retailers was evident, as B2C deliveries were up 11%.", "Despite negative industrial production, B2B deliveries were up 2%, with the majority of the increase driven by our ecommerce return portfolio. Base rate improvements were able to somewhat offset lower fuel surcharges and a drag from a change in product mix. As a result, revenue per package was up about 1%. Ecommerce customers are helping drive higher daily shipments across our entire portfolio of services, from high-single-digit growth in Air products to a 20% jump in our most economical product, SurePost.", "Even with the accelerated growth of ecommerce, our investments in ORION continue to allow UPS to bend the cost curve lower and create positive return. ORION added efficiency again this quarter. Delivery stops and volume were both up 5.7%, yet ORION held package miles to only 1.4% increase. Direct labor hours also grew slower than the average daily volume growth. As we guided, operating profit growth comparisons with 2015 were restrained by one less operating day in 2016 and higher casualty credits realized last year. Excluding these profit headwinds, operating margins expanded as we took advantage of the benefits of our investments.", "Now for some details on the International segment, where we had another record with double-digit operating profit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. Profit jumped 14% as shipments climbed 7.5%. Revenue was up more than 3% on a currency neutral basis and fuel surcharge did decline, lowering the growth rate by about 70 basis points. U.S. export packages per day rose over 7%. Growth was well-balanced on solid shipments out of Asia and across Europe. The non-U.S. Domestic product increased 7.8% as we transitioned through pricing action we took in 2015. This quarter, it shows it's about getting the right volume in our network. Our International segment is delivering balanced results with great growth and superior returns.", "Let's turn and look at the Supply Chain and Freight segment now. The segment produced topline growth of 8.1%, primarily driven by the Coyote acquisition. Economic conditions in the U.S. truckload and LTL market as well as the International Air Freight business continued to place downward pressure on demand. The Forwarding unit remained disciplined on revenue management and cost controls. Gains from the small and medium sized customers reduced the year-over-year shortfall in total tonnage. UPS Freight has been adversely impacted by industry conditions, seeing total tonnage drop. However, they're executing a disciplined middle-market strategy, which has resulted in revenue per hundredweight pricing improvements of 3.7% this quarter.", "Turning to our distribution group, revenue growth was broad-based with contributions from almost all sectors. The business unit maintained its industry-leading margins in the mid- to upper-single digits.", "Now to update you on our cash position. UPS again generated healthy free cash flow. Through the first nine months, we've produce $3.6 billion after investing over $1.8 billion in capital expenditures. Please note that we accelerated our planned discretionary pension contribution to September. This allows us to capture additional financial benefits in 2016.", "UPS also repurchased 19.5 million shares for $2 billion and paid out another $2 billion in dividends, up 7% per share over the last year. As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate total operating profit growth to be slightly higher than our full-year guidance of 6% to 8%. Supply Chain and Freight is continuing to manage through industry challenges and is expected to produce modest low-single digit revenue expansion by holding operating margin flat with last year. For the full year, the macro environment is suppressing revenue growth. Therefore, Supply Chain and Freight operating profit is anticipated to be slightly below 2015 levels.", "We are projecting an effective tax rate for UPS of 35% in the fourth quarter. Due to the unknowns related to the mark-to-markets at year end, we are not able to provide guidance on our GAAP earnings per share. However, we are affirming our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5.70 to $5.90.", "In summary, on a year-to-date basis our business is adapting to the opportunities and challenges presented by the high-growth digital economy. We continue to produce the industry's best margins and create great free cash flow. As we look at the fourth quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver another outstanding peak season for both our customers and our investors.", "Before we take your questions, I want to take a moment to announce our plans to hold an Investor Conference in early 2017. On February 21 in New York, we'll have a half-day conference. David, along with the senior leaders and myself, will be on hand to lay out our recent progress and update you on our strategy. We'll plan to allow ample time for your questions. Later today, the IR team will send out invitations with further details.", "Thank you. And now I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer period. Our first question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning and congratulations on the strong volumes and solid results in the quarter. I wanted to ask you about the new plane order. It's an interesting topic, given you haven't ordered planes for quite a while. I wanted to get your thoughts on maybe the implications of that and some of the assumptions you make when you order long lasting, long lived assets like that. So does this imply that you would think that the strong growth in Air volumes would continue? And then if you look out the next five years, is that kind of a reasonable implication? And also in terms of your largest customer who has been adding aircraft, is there an implication that you're not particularly concerned about share with that customer? So just wondered if you could talk about the kind of assumptions underlying that sizable plane order that you announced this morning. Thank you.", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Good morning, Tom. This is Myron. When you look at it on balance, since 2008 the International export volume has grown over 40%. U.S. Domestic has had 20% growth, and our block hours are actually down over 3%. It actually speaks to our abilities to optimize our networks around the world and accommodate the tremendous growth that we've seen. So going with the larger aircraft, which is the Dash 8 really was a smart choice for us. Obviously given the ability to put a larger plane on the lanes that have greater needs allows us to reduce the number of frequencies for those routes.", "In addition to that, the Dash 8 will give us an ability to cascade capacity throughout our entire network. We plan to deploy these first aircraft into our International segment, and it will allow us to bring back our current 747-400s to the U.S. that will give us capacity throughout the entire system. In addition to that, it's a much smarter choice because it allows us to take the current Dash 4 pilot, who will require a very minimum amount of additional training, who can then fly the Dash 8. So we believe it was a very smart choice for us. And I'll hand it off to Alan, who can talk about growth.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Hey, Tom. Thanks for the question. As you know, Next Day Air was up 6% this past quarter and deferred was up double-digit. And our Next Day Air growth here in the U.S. has been growing mid-single digit for the last five quarters, and certainly the Second Day Air has grown double-digit this quarter, and last year this same quarter. And you already heard from Myron about the International growth. We've been investing significantly in our Express product in terms of enhancements. As you know, this past quarter we expanded our Express Plus time of day to 53 countries and over the year, we've expanded our Express time of day to 117 countries, and we've also expanded UPS Next Day Air and UPS Next Day Air Early coverage here in the United States and in addition also Worldwide Express Freight. So we're investing significantly in the product both domestically and internationally, and it's resonating with our customers.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "And this is David. Just to wrap that up, in some places or in some cases, you'd be adding aircraft because you're retiring aircraft. This is really about opportunity. This is a testament to what we have done in our International business and in our Domestic business as far as growing our Air business. Our customers are asking us for additional capacity, and that's what this initiative is about. So we're really excited about it. And thank you for the question.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. And I'll echo the nice job in scaling with the volumes. Richard, you gave insight and an outlook for the Supply Chain, but I don't \u2013 unless I missed it, I don't think you gave it on the Domestic or International outlook. So aside from the peak prep, in your targets, can you talk about your expectations for growth and costs and pricing? And then really I want to focus on the ability to improve margins domestically given the ecommerce growth? Thanks.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. So I think, Ken, when you first look at it, you have to start with where we are year-to-date, and right now our earnings per share are up almost 7%. We expect our fourth quarter operating growth profit to be slightly higher than the overall range we gave the year, which means we expect a very solid great fourth quarter. The investments that we've made across all the segments are bringing in those returns, and we're balancing that against the mix macro environment, as we talked about in Supply Chain and Freight.", "At the end, when you look at what's happening and where we're going with it, it really is about an International continuing to deliver on what they've really done for seven quarters. And in the Domestic, we will see margin expansion for the year. We have, as I mentioned last quarter, some change because of work days and some year-over-year comp issues in the third quarter, but we expect the whole year that we will see a margin expansion.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We will take an online question next. This comes from Jack Atkins at Stephens. And Jack really asks, can we speak a little bit more about the long-term capital spending over the next few years, both with the hub automation and the aircraft?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So, again, this is Richard. And Jack, I think the first thing you have to remember here is that our capital policy remains consistent and unchanged. Our number one priority for many years has continued to be to reinvest in the business. And you see that in our ROIC (26:39), having the highest return on invested capital is not only good for the enterprise, but it's also good for the shareholders.", "We continue to see strong returns for all the investments we've made. Over the last few years we've talked about not only what we're doing in the hubs, but also ORION. And again this quarter we continue to see the benefits of almost a 6% volume growth and muted miles growth. And so all that comes to the bottom line. We're always evaluating ways to look at, can we accelerate some of this investment because there's such high return on these investments we are making?", "I talked about in my talk that we're going to actually bring everyone together in early February to really talk about where the enterprise is going, what great opportunities we have, where we'll see growth come from, and what our plans are for next year. And we think at that time you'll see that the future's very bright. We continue to have year-over-year improvements in margin, and that's our plan going forward as well.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Good morning. Yeah, I guess, Richard, just to follow up on that point, and not to belabor the CapEx question, understanding that you'll probably provide more context in February. But could you clarify whether these aircraft purchases were included in that 4.5% to 5% of revenue CapEx target that you guys had outlined in 2014? Or is this above and beyond what that initial target had contemplated?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. Ben, when you think about how we look at \u2013 how we plan out our multiple years, there's several different realistic scenarios of what could happen. For example, it was a perfect time to bring together both Boeing and UPS, because there was availability, and we continue to see such strong demand in our business that the aircraft timing came a little faster than we thought. However, we're not guiding any different for 2016. It's in the $2.8 billion we've been talking about, because a portion of it is paid this year. And the most important thing to remember here is, we're great stewards of capital. We had not bought a plane in 2013 until today.", "But since 1989, that was the very first time since we've been an airline that we were able to continue to create efficiencies within our network. So when you take what David had mentioned, a 15% increase in demand, it was time to look at, what is the next thing we needed to do, and at the same time, we continue to have above market growth in these products, and we'll have positive returns. But we will update you further as we bring the entire enterprise story together in the next few months.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Understood. Thanks, Richard.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Mr. Vernon, your line is open.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Steven, if you can move to the next caller, please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Want just to stick on the topic of the planes for just a moment, and kind of think about how you do the math between new owned aircraft and sort of available belly space. I'm guessing there's parameters of control and service that probably weight a little bit in favor of owned capacity, but just want to get a sense of maybe how you guys think about that. You've done a great job over the years using third-party aircraft. Kind of want to get a sense of what the incremental change is for the owned aircraft going forward.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. When we think about the holistic network, and Myron actually mentioned that there's a cascading effect, we run a very broad network across the entire globe. And we're going to put those planes where the highest demand is. We also use a lot of belly space in different pieces of our enterprise; in Supply Chain and Freight, where we use a combination of brown tails and commercial lift.", "But the real important thing here is, we tend to look at all the scenarios and determine what's the best economic return. And it goes right back to the return on invested capital, when's the right time to put new assets in, how are we going to fill them, are we already filling them because of our growth rate? And when you have all of that put together, that's why in 2013 we paused, and it made sense, and we could adjust and cascade around our own network, because there was many changing dynamics within the market for over the last three years. But now it's time. And that time is because it will give a very positive return.", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So, Chris, this order matches the needs of our networks and gives us greater flexibility moving forward. And when you think of it, this aircraft, the Dash 8, gives you 70,000 pounds more capacity than the 777. It also gives you 16% more capacity than our current aircraft type, which is the Dash 4. It allows you to have 34 containers on the main deck, as well as 14 in the lower compartments, plus space for bulk cargo. So we believe again, as I alluded to earlier, that this is the smart choice for UPS.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. We're going to take a question from the Internet. This is from Helane Becker. And it's talking about questions about Amazon. And when you think about ecommerce going forward, how do you think about competing in a market where Amazon may at some point start to convince shippers to use its Fulfillment by Amazon services?", "So I'll start with this answer, and then I'll turn it over to Alan Gershenhorn. And of course I'll begin that Amazon's a good customer of ours. We do believe we have a strong, mutually beneficial relationship, and that our integrated network creates efficiencies, and really gives them and our other customers a value proposition that we believe is unmatched.", "So going back to an earlier question about the aircraft and tying into Amazon, I don't think that we've wrapped up at that point. Amazon and all of our other shippers will get the benefit of this cascading capacity that we're adding with this aircraft. So we think it's very good news for all of our customers.", "When it comes to the Fulfillment by Amazon, Alan, will you address that please?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, thanks, David. Yeah, as we all know, our customers, and specifically our ecommerce customers, have a number of different channels that they can access in order to market and transport their goods. And there's Fulfillment by Amazon, there are marketplaces out there, and obviously direct from their website. We really support our customers in all three of those areas. And I think, like David said, our ecommerce value proposition is really second to none, and it's convincing both the bricks and clicks type of etailers in the ecommerce pure plays to give more and more of their business to UPS. So we're excited about the overall prospects of ecommerce in the marketplace, and we're making the necessary adjustments to essentially support all the various channels that our customers use to bring their goods to market.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. So, wanted to just follow up on the U.S. Package margins, or incremental margins. Obviously really good volume growth, but not seeing it kind of leverage to the bottom line. I know you talked about an operating day and one other item, but are there other kind of \u2013 is ORION \u2013 are we still dealing with implementation costs? Or is there something else here that's restraining the operating leverage? And I guess maybe the question is what can you start to do to see some better incremental margins? And along those lines, is dimensional pricing an option for 2017 like FedEx is doing?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So I think, Scott, the first thing is the way we look at a quarter, we had a good quarter. We're right where we expected to be in the U.S. We did call out last quarter as well as in my talk today, this is a scale business, and there was a change in work days. And that change in work days has a big impact on the quarter just as next quarter, while we called out that we'll actually perform a little better than our range for the year is because there's an extra work day.", "And then that high casualty credit in 2015 that we called out at that point. And so you remove all that, we actually saw operating margin improvement year over year. And we actually expect the whole year to continue to see that. 2016 really is part of a deliberate strategy. We're seeing the benefits from the investments. We are reinvesting, so were not getting all of the benefits, but we're getting the benefits that we actually have been talking about. And we said it would be a multiyear process. But we're delivering on those targets. We expect to continue to see that steady progress year over year, and that's why I mentioned earlier that we will see margin expansion in the U.S. for all of 2016 as well. I'm going to turn it over to Myron to talk a little bit about the actual operations and what he's seen.", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So in addition to Richard's comments, you heard Kate allude to the fact that we had 100% completion of the deployment of ORION in September, and we're very happy with the results that we're seeing. And actually, we're in the early stages of deploying additional automation projects that should bring more profit to the bottom line. We've actually already begun the Phase 2 deployment of ORION. It'll impact another 1,300 drivers who were in extended centers that didn't have the package flow technology deploys in those sites. And we expect to finish that mid-year next year.", "In addition to that, our automation strategy is well underway, and we're happy with the result that we're seeing. We're seeing 25% improvement in productivity. As a matter fact, we've announced 12 new automated facility deployments this year as well as four here just in the third quarter. So we're well on our way to implementing that long-term strategy and are seeing the results.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Hey, this is Alan. Just a final follow-up there on the dim weight part of that question. First, we don't comment on competitors' pricing actions. And as you know, we review our pricing on a regular basis, including the base rates and the assessorials. We are achieving our strategies of base rate increases between 2% and 3%. We're at the higher end of that. Also we announced our GRI in September. We also announced that any additional rate changes including the retail rate posting in our SurePost rates will be posted on November 18 of this year. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'll stay on U.S. Domestic Package, and specifically, in B2B, kind of a two-part question. It sounds like B2B grew and you cited in the press release the online retail returns. So the first part is could you give us an idea of how strong that's trending and just thoughts on maybe the seasonality around the holidays and impact in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter? And then also, just the B2B part that isn't pertaining to that, what type of a business environment are you seeing? And where's the momentum there? Thank you.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Alan, why don't we start with you about B2B and then maybe Kate, talk a little bit about the seasonal trends you're seeing.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, so as we said, our B2B is up about 2%. It's best growth we've had there in five quarters. As you know, the B2C is very strong at double-digit. Specific to your question, on the returns, returns growth in ecommerce is also very strong. It's growing in the mid-teens. Again, you got to keep in mind that returns is a small part of our B2B market, but it's a large part of the growth that we're seeing today. As concerns the remainder of the B2B market, we're still seeing the softness in industrial production out there. We are seeing B2B growth across many of our segments, although it's relatively muted. Do you want to talk a little bit, Kate, about the peak season?", "Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yes. Thanks, Alan. This is Kate. And as Alan mentioned, strong B2B growth despite the downward pressure of industrial production. And we expect that to continue through peak season. I do want to emphasize the UPS Access Points turning commercial \u2013 or I'm sorry, residential business into commercial business. And with 25,000 locations worldwide, 8,000 of which in the U.S., we're really seeing this solution resonate with our customers and also the convenience for consumers so that they can go to their local shop and pick up their packages. So that will help to fortify that continued B2B growth. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for coming back to me. Apologies for the connection problem before. Richard, maybe could you talk a little bit about International and the underlining performance there? Obviously you're still getting some of that currency benefit. I'm just trying to make sure that the business ex the hedge gain is still chunking along. And if you could give us some commentary on how that growth outlook looks for the fourth quarter, that'd be helpful? Thanks.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Great. So I'm actually going to start and then turn it over to Jim to talk a little about the underlying business. But we did have another great quarter, seventh quarter in a row, but the International operating margin was pushed a little higher because of the multi-year hedge strategy that we employed, we have been employed for many years. We've been talking about that all year. And one of the challenges of course is the volatility of the euro and the sterling is at historical rates and it's brought it down.", "So we expect 2017 to have a transition where we'll see just over $300 million impact to the growth and the profit. That being said, when you step back for a moment, we continue to see the operating margin expand, even adjusting for the hedge. We're talking about operating margins between 16% and 17%, which is industry leading for an international business. It's broad based. It's because of the revenue growth, getting the right volume in our network and managing our cost efficiently. And so when we think about the fourth quarter, we expect that they'll continue to stay at the high end of their range and I'm going to ask Jim to talk a little about specifically the business.", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, David, on the point about, I guess, chunking along and moving forward, I think what you're seeing right now in International is the output of a couple years of investments in the network and work and strategies across the globe. We mentioned, David did in the beginning, that a couple of pockets across the world from Asia-Pacific, Asia-Pacific and specifically China and Hong Kong for us right now are growing at rates we've never seen before but more importantly it's coming from our middle markets there. Historically, we've had big enterprise growth as supply chains expanded across the world, but we're really becoming more local in a lot of these markets or some of those bigger markets like China, we're seeing middle-market growth rates at 20% and 30% year-over-year. So that's great for us.", "Europe continues to speed itself up. Again, in some of the opening comments, we've taken a look at the network and continued to speed it up, and obviously we have. We're up to about 80% of the cities in Europe we can reach by two days in the ground network there, and we'll continue to invest there. So all in all, we think the fourth quarter will be great and we'll continue on absent the currency headwinds that Richard has mentioned to continue the growth in the International segment.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "So the macro environment in Europe is still kind of holding together and you're not seeing anything big negative implications from Brexit or anything like that?", "James Jay Barber, Jr. - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Well, I mean I think Brexit is one of those issues and I think the whole European economy is probably wider than just Brexit, no question. But we continue to see growth in that market as we have for many years.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "All right. Thanks very much for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes. Good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit about just kind of what some of your ecommerce customers are doing in terms of strategy where certainly today they're competing in terms of the two-day shipping against Amazon and hence the need to probably add some of that air capacity. But we also talk about moving a lot of goods closer to the customer and one of the reasons why you're doing the automation in terms of the regional sort facilities. Just wondering if you could talk about those trends a little bit in terms of the long-term strategy of where you need to put that capacity in order to meet those shifting needs.", "Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, thank you. This is Kate, and we have the deep collaboration with our customers, as you can imagine, and we help them through changes in the marketplace. So specifically to B2C and getting closer to their customers, we have a full portfolio of omni-channel solutions and I will say it's not just resonating with retailers but more and more we're seeing this translate throughout other industries such as healthcare and even high-tech for sure and industrial manufacturing. But it's enabling any of their locations and turning those into direct shipping points would be the focus of a lot of the solutions, and they're not just physical. They're also information based and we find that it helps them to capture their share of the growth in the market. Thanks for the question.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So our next question we will take another online question, and we've got multiple questions on this topic. The question is how do we think about automation affecting our business model both from a drones, a platooning and an automated vehicle standpoint moving forward?", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thank you. This is Myron. I'll start with automation first. We are continuing to make good progress with our long-term initiatives to add more capacity, offer greater efficiency in our integrated network by introducing automation throughout our top tier 30 (46:21) hubs across the U.S. where we process as much as 60% through those locations. I mentioned earlier that we'd announced 12 automated facilities this year including four this quarter. We're on pace and we're making great progress. Those include retrofitting, expansion and in some cases new facilities. And again, we're getting as much as 25% production improvements in those locations. This, of course, allows us to have additional flexibilities and reduce handles in the network.", "When it comes to the use of drones as well as vehicles that allow us to have autonomous trucks on the road, we have experimented with drones with a number of vendors. You should've seen an announcement where we launched our first try in the Northeast earlier this year. It was very successful, as well as our use in delivering medications in Africa. So we'll continue to experiment until we get the ability to use it.", "As it pertains to vehicles, we're continuing to work with a number of vendors to explore what works best for us. We have what we term as a rolling laboratory. We have over 6,500 vehicles in the U.S. right now that are considered CNG, LNG, and the sort. Of course, all of this will require the approval from the National Highway and Traffic Association. So when it becomes available to us, we certainly expect to be ready.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Steven, let me just remind the callers asking live questions to make sure that they only ask one question, so that we can get through the remainder of the calls for the time remaining.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. And I'll be sure to keep it to one. So, as I look at your Domestic profitability the past six years, your margins have been around the low 13%s to mid 13%s. And we know that we've seen a lot more B2C growth in that same time period. So, as we look forward, I think everyone's expecting ecommerce to continue to outperform. Is there a change in that dynamic where we can actually start to get stop density? (48:40) Or has competitive factors like the post office, and maybe even Amazon doing more on their own, just impacted the ability for you guys to take higher margins?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So, Brandon, I guess I would start with saying, all of it. When you think about what's happening with density, Kate talked about the Access Points and taking what was a B2C to B2R, and that's helping on density. And we are seeing an improvement on B2C density that we hadn't seen in many, many years. On top of that, we continue to invest in the automation, both at the hubs, ORION that Myron talked about, and all of that really is about improving the margin. We talked about, in our Investor Conference a few years ago and throughout each year, that we're investing, and year over year we're having to reinvest to get to the endpoint. And all of that together, along with things like SurePost Redirect, and the ability to take almost a third of the volume that's destined to be delivered by the post office and we put it in our system, because we're already going to those stops. Those are all key components of how we're going to continue to improve the margin. And really it's a long-term story that we're talking about.", "Earlier I actually mentioned, and perhaps I said the wrong year, that we do expect margin expansion for the entire year of 2016. And that's why we guided the way we did for the fourth quarter. Expect a little bit better performance in the fourth quarter, and we'll have three of the four quarters in 2016 with margin expansion, that all adds to margin expansion for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about SurePost. I know you saw some nice volume growth in that segment, up 20% year over year. Just wondering what the progress is on SurePost Redirect, and whether you see that improving density, as well as potential density improvements coming from increased returns to the B2B segment? Thank you.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. This is Alan. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so the SurePost Redirect program continues to work. As Rich just stated, when we redirect, we've already got a package going to that particular consumer. So it's very, very accretive to us to reroute that package back through the UPS network and avoid having to pay any postal fees at that particular point, and we're up around 30%. We're continuing to investigate new and better ways to improve that. And then we've also got other methodologies, like UPS Access Point that Kate mentioned, to build density, as well as our synchronized delivery solution. So it's all really about bending the cost curve and increasing the density on our B2C shipments.", "Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to talk a little bit about the ecommerce portfolio you mentioned, or the return portfolio that you said is growing mid-teens. What percent of your shipments today are returns? And is that a better yield than average on the shipment? Or how would you characterize that, in terms of attractiveness relative to the average box?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, so when you look at the ecommerce market, it could be one in five or one out of every six packages that are shipped to a consumer get returned. So the growth in that particular market tracks very closely to the growth in ecommerce on that one to five, one to six ratio. Those packages are highly profitable.", "First of all, many of those packages get dropped off and don't have to be picked up because the consumer finds it more convenient to drop them off at UPS stores or UPS Access Points or hand them to a UPS driver. So there's very little cost when it comes to pick-up. And then obviously, the deliveries are going back to businesses, and we could be delivering tens or hundreds of packages back to these businesses. So it's a highly profitable B2B delivery with very little pick-up cost.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So we're going to take another online question. This question comes from Scott Group, and Scott just asked \u2013 noticing the new language that we have regarding the mark to market pension accounting outlook, and would like to know, can we give a little preliminary outlook for what the pension expense is for 2017?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So, I think the first thing everyone should understand is, the language change was really meant to ensure that we're following a new report that was published by the SEC around interpretive guidance around both the GAAP, non-GAAP and ensuring that we had equal prominence. And the way the rules work is, you have to have certain information you need to convey around the GAAP side.", "It really is too early, and that's why there wasn't anything in the report about what we thought the mark to market would be because there's so many things that aren't even finished yet for us to know where we would be. For example, return on assets and discount rate. And if you go back last year this time and where we are today and where we ended the year, the discount rates changed a lot. And of course last year, the market changed the other direction, unfortunately. So there are so many unknowns right now that it's really impossible to sit here and say, this is what we think it's going to be.", "That all beings that, what we were doing with \u2013 and what we put in the press release was if you look at the underlying core business, we're confirming that our adjusted earnings per share guidance is right in where we expected it to be, and that's because the investments that we put in the last few years are creating the returns. And that's why we're going to see the margin expansion, and that's why we've guided the way we have.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Oh. Thanks, operator. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. There's been a lot of talk about wage rates going up on part-time workers and warehouse workers and the fact that it's harder and harder to find them. And I know that at UPS you guys have a lot of people come back every year for the peak, and they're happy to do that. But what about longer term as you think about hiring out those 95,000 people? Can you just address how that affects your thought process after the peak?", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, Helane, this is Myron. We're actually on plan for peak season hiring to date. 37% of our peak hires since 2014 have actually become permanent hires. I'm happy to tell you that I was actually a peak hire from 1978. So we think the best value proposition is the ability to attract and retain people who are looking for long term opportunities for growth at UPS who began with us as peak hires. There are some selected locations where we will use bonuses to attract employees, but overall we don't think there'll be any issues. Thank you.", "Operator", "And due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in here. So 2016 has been a year where really impressive profit growth in your International business led the overall franchise. And you talked a little bit and gave us an update on 2017's FX headwinds. And with that potentially walking back over a year of growth in the International segment, do you think the other two segments can pick up that slack by delivering the high-single digit and low-double digit profit growth that you put out in your long-term targets?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "This is Richard. And I think the important thing to remember on all three of our business segments is we are working a five-year plan with each year getting and making progress on our ultimate goals. So the answer is it's a little too early to talk about 2017, and we actually talked about that we're going to bring everyone together in February to really give you a full picture of the enterprise strategy, where we're headed, where we have great opportunities and where growth is coming from. And I think that that will help you to see why we are so optimistic about the future.", "But at the same time, all three segments are part of the five-year plan. When we created the plan, we saw that the euro was already starting to fall, not quite as much, but we actually came back and talked about that. So we'll update you, but it was all part, and each segment is part of that plan overall.", "Operator", "I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Abney. Please go ahead, sir.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yes. I'd like to just make some closing comments. And one of the words that you've heard a little bit today is commitment, and I just want to use that for the next few minutes and just talk about how we're committed to our business. Obviously, we're committed to achieving our EPS guidance that we gave just about a year ago, and we have affirmed that for the fourth quarter and feel real good about that.", "We're committed to delivering another successful peak season. You heard from Myron, you heard from Kate, and we've been working the last 10 months here, and through this collaboration and cooperation with our customers, we have a good peak season set up for us.", "We're committed through our strategic initiatives and our investments to continue to build the long-term future of UPS. This aircraft addition and the longer-term initiative, but also what we're doing internationally in Europe with the $2 billion worth of CapEx that we're spending, we're getting a lot of returns in that. And we're going to continue to focus on those growth markets.", "And then of course we're committed to our shareholders, our customers and our employees. So we've had a good year so far. We have good momentum going into the fourth quarter, and we look forward to having a very successful fourth quarter. Thank you very much for your time.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our call.

LLC", "Unknown Speaker", "MANAGEMENT DISCU.S.SION SECTION", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Tony, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Good morning, and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectation for the future performance or results of operations of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.", "Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.", "Now, I will turn the call over to David.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone. At our Investor Conference in February, we laid out our investment strategy for the next three to five years. The cornerstone was accelerating investment in our smart global logistics network, which represents the most sweeping transformation of our network in decades.", "We're stepping up the pace of investments now to enable UPS to better participate in the vast opportunities we see ahead. The benefits from new revenues and improve productivity will be fully realized in coming years and quarters as these investments become operational. The market dynamics and customer demand experienced in the first quarter deepened our confidence that we are on the right track.", "Looking more closely at the first quarter, we're very pleased with the revenue gains achieved in each of our three operating segments. While revenues were strong, our operating margin in the first quarter was affected by some known and some unanticipated headwinds. Richard will discuss these items in more detail during his remarks.", "Turning briefly to the economy, the U.S. economic outlook has improved over the last few months and the growth is expected to move slightly higher for the remainder of the year. Consumer confidence is at a 15-year high and the labor market has tightened. Economists have included additional growth in their forecasts from the administration's efforts to modernize trade agreements, reform tax policy, and upgrade infrastructure. We support efforts that boost trade, remove unnecessary regulations, and stimulate real GDP expansion.", "Overall, global economic forecasts are largely unchanged with economists still projecting faster expansion in the near term and an accelerated pace of global trade. We're already seeing those trends at work in our results in Europe and in Asia.", "While the economy is showing positive momentum, at UPS, we're focused on generating growth by expanding our capabilities in ways that fully leverage our network. For instance, we've announced the construction of two large highly automated regional hubs during the quarter. These projects will add nearly 2 million square feet of capacity in the Salt Lake City and Dallas areas.", "UPS has 23 global modernization projects in the works. These investments, along with other network optimization and data connectivity initiatives, are part of our broad strategy to use technology to add capacity and to improve our operating performance.", "We also use technology to enhance the customer experience at UPS, and we're excited about the recent successful launch of our new ups.com website and the related digital marketing capabilities. These capabilities enable us to present relevant problem-solving information combined with the UPS shipping offer to existing and prospective customers via the web. We expect to provide customers a more personalized experience while growing incremental revenue.", "Given our significant investments in rapidly changing technology, UPS is creating a new Advanced Technology Group comprised of leading IT and engineering experts. The Advanced Technology Group will be responsible for the research, testing and development of new innovations and the application of those technologies. They will also help us strengthen collaboration with technology companies and academic institutions to bring the best solutions to UPS.", "We will advance the use of the latest technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve customer service and make operations more efficient. I'm really excited about the potential of this group to transform our company even further to the benefit of our customers and to our investors.", "Beyond technology, we're also adding to our service portfolio. We're making great progress rolling out our new U.S. Saturday ground operations. In addition to the three cities tested in 2016, we've recently started operations in 15 metropolitan areas, including the three largest markets: New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.", "One of the many benefits for our customers is the ability to tender ground shipments to UPS on Saturday and have the package arrive on Monday. The initial results have been promising. New shipments picked up on Saturday have been balanced across our product line and we remain on plan to expand coverage across nearly 4,700 cities by the holiday season later this year.", "Another example of how we're upgrading our service portfolio is the expansion of our dangerous goods shipping capabilities. We now accept more than 400 new commodities in our global air network and more than 300 additional products for ground shipments across Europe.", "As we expand our portfolio, we're also improving our service levels to provide customers with the most timely service available. We've shortened delivery times all across our intra-Europe ground network. In fact, we're cutting a full day out of our delivery times between more than 350 cities in 26 countries.", "Over the last year, we've improved transit times for virtually the entire ground network, serving the 28 EU countries plus Switzerland and Norway. These enhancements are clearly driving forward our business in Europe. In fact, we achieved another quarter of double-digit gains in European cross-border shipments, and UPS' total export growth rate is the highest we've produced since 2010. Our international business continues to lead the industry while growing market share around the world.", "Turning to the Supply Chain & Freight segment, the integration of Marken continues to show very good progress. The business opportunities and customer acceptance have been outstanding. The pharma industry recently recognized the Marken and UPS by ranking us number one in clinical trials logistics. Together, these actions demonstrate the commitment UPS is making to grow our business throughout the world. While we've been making great progress, we plan to announce additional strategic moves in the coming weeks.", "During the quarter, UPS was once again named as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute. Customers and investors alike should know their reputations are being protected by a company with high ethical standards.", "Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to recognize an elite group of UPSers. We now employ more than 9,300 drivers who have each driven at least 25 years without an accident. That means that nearly 1 out of every 10 UPS drivers have qualified for the UPS Circle of Honor. That is an incredible accomplishment and testament to our training and the quality of our people.", "I want to express the gratitude of our entire company for their outstanding representation of UPS and congratulate all UPSers that work behind the scenes to ensure we safely navigate in the communities we serve.", "Now, Richard will provide more details on our results. Richard?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, David, and good morning everyone. UPS produced strong first quarter revenue growth of 6.2% and adjusted for currency, we were up 7.5%. Top line improvement was balanced across all three segments.", "Looking at the highlights of the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.32, up almost 4% over last year. Total operating profit was almost $1.8 billion and currency-adjusted operating profit was $1.9 billion.", "The U.S. Domestic segment improved package yield in all products with solid revenue growth. International delivered excellent results, with double-digit growth and contributions from all products and all regions. And finally, Supply Chain & Freight had a remarkable quarter, growing both top line, tonnage and shipments by producing higher operating profit.", "Core performance in the business was slightly ahead of plan. However, some known and some unexpected headwinds affected bottom-line performance in both the U.S. and the International segments. Let me make a few comments on the effects of these items before covering the quarterly highlights.", "As previously disclosed, the currency hedge transition weighed on International results in the quarter. To provide additional transparency, we've included an enhancement to the currency-neutral web schedule, including operating profit on a currency neutral basis.", "Currency impacted operating profit in the quarter by $119 million in the segment and we still anticipate a drag from currency to be about $400 million for the full year.", "Net fuel was a drag this quarter on operating profit as well. The fuel surcharge for January was based on lower fuel prices in November of 2016. This timing lag created an almost $30 million shortfall in the U.S. Domestic segment.", "The actual fuel prices increased from November. In early February, we reduced the lag between revenue and expense from two months to two weeks. This mitigates net fuel timing issues moving forward.", "Startup expense for investment projects and service enhancements will continue to weigh on operating profits for the remainder of 2017. However, as new areas of the country come online for Saturday delivery, new revenue will begin to offset deployment cost later this year.", "Also notable during this quarter were the irregular growth rates across the months. Specifically, there was a pause in consumer spending activity in February, likely driven by a number of factors including some weather and the delayed income tax refunds.", "And lastly, with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock awards, we recorded a tax credit this quarter. This process will be a first quarter only annual tax event. In February, we outlined this change in our 10-K and at the Investor Conference.", "Now, let's turn to the details of each segment. U.S. Domestic revenue was up 5% to $9.5 billion. Revenue per package increased 2.4%, with yield growth in air and ground products. Higher fuel surcharges this year added approximately 50 basis points. We are continuing to develop and will implement initiatives around surge pricing to ensure revenue is properly aligned with cost to serve throughout the year.", "In volume, our average daily volume was up 2.6%, led by air products as Next Day Air and Deferred both grew by approximately 4%. E-commerce demand drove the continuing shift in product mix. B2C shipments increased about 7%.", "On the commercial side, B2B shipment growth improved quarter-over-quarter, but remained down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We are seeing signs of rebounding activity in many of the industrial production sectors. However, brick-and-mortar retail customers continue to adjust their business model to service more online purchasing and many are closing stores. As they move through this transition, UPS is investing in solutions to take advantage of these shifting market trends.", "Turning to our operating costs, we were affected by fuel and operating penalties associated with 17 major projects currently under construction and the expansion of 15 major metropolitan areas through the deployment of Saturday delivery. And lastly, we had several late winter storms. We put the combined effect of these items to be around $85 million and estimate about 60% of that are onetime in nature. Given these headwinds, operating profit was $1.1 billion.", "Looking now at the International segment, total revenue increased almost 5% to $3.1 billion and was up nearly 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Exports jumped more than 14%, with strong growth across regions and products. Export gains in Asia, Europe and the Americas were all around 15%, and Europe cross-border shipments increased more than 15%.", "Non-U.S. Domestic shipments were up nearly 11%, driven by double-digit growth in Poland, Italy, and France. Importantly, we are seeing faster growth in both the established and emerging markets of the world.", "Our International portfolio is performing remarkably well. We are creating value for our customers while expanding global solutions with the execution of our investment strategy. The European lane enhancements that David mentioned are contributing to the market share gain.", "Operating profit was $529 million, down about 7.8%. Adjusted for currency, operating profit was $648 million, up almost 13%.", "This quarter, our results were produced through a balanced approach. First, we had market-leading growth across all products. Second, we had improved network efficiency in all regions of the world. And finally, globally, we continue to focus on creating customer-driven solutions.", "Turning to Supply Chain & Freight, it was a great quarter, best first quarter operating profit in our history. We had broad-based improvements across the segment. Revenue increased 13% on tonnage growth and forwarding and UPS Freight. Operating profit climbed 22% and the margin expanded 50 basis points.", "Driven by high demand for middle-market customers, the forwarding unit experience around 10% growth in tonnage across all major products as the market conditions improved. Distribution revenue grew at mid-single-digits due to the increased demand from healthcare, retail, and aerospace customers. Operating profit and margin improved significantly over the prior year.", "UPS Freight revenue was up more than 8% on LTL revenue per hundredweight gain and tonnage improvements. We are extremely pleased with the progress the Supply Chain & Freight units are making.", "Now, let's turn to our cash flow. UPS ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. We used capital this quarter to invest in growth opportunities, fund our pension, and distribute returns to our shareholders.", "First, we've accelerated our pace of investments into the business for capacity, capabilities, and flexibility. And as a result, our capital expenses were up to $938 million for the quarter and we're on track to reinvest 6% to 7% of revenue this year as we have guided.", "Second, cash from operations was used to take advantage of rising PBGC premiums and lower future operating expense. We advanced our planned and discretionary funding to the first quarter and have no plans for further contributions in 2017.", "And lastly, we have distributed funds to shareholders to the repurchase of more than 4 million shares for about $450 million and paid out nearly $800 million in dividends, up 6% per share over last year. This quarter, our effective tax rate was about 32%.", "As we disclosed in the 10-K and mentioned at the Investor Conference, we adopted the change in stock-based compensation accounting standard during the first quarter. As a result, we expect our tax rate to be 35% in the upcoming quarters and the effective rate for 2017 in total to be around 34.5%.", "Looking forward, we remain committed to the original guidance for this year with earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, including about $400 million or $0.30 per share unfavorable impact of currency.", "In summary, customer demand for UPS services increased. We are moving forward fast, using our financial strength for our investment and growth opportunities to ensure we capitalize on the expanding market in our industry.", "Thank you for your time today. Now, we'll ask the operator to open the line so we can take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. As a reminder, please ask only one question so we may accommodate more callers. Feel free to get back into the queue and we'll take a second question, time permitting. Our first question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. It looks like some very strong B2C growth in the quarter and solid in B2B. Could you speak to what you see in margins in the ground business going forward with this mix shift dynamic that you cited? Thanks.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. This is Richard. And I think we should start by saying that when we look at 2017, we're early in an investment cycle as we transform the network into the smart global local logistics network.", "This quarter, we did have some costs that we weren't expecting and we called those out on both in my talk and in this press release, but there was about $35 million that was driven by almost 5 million square feet of development of new buildings that currently under construction and the Saturday operations.", "But when you put all that together, we still expect to have leverage this year. We knew that some of the startup costs would be early in the year. And the other important thing to remember here is that we did see a pause in consumer demand in February. Fortunately, March came right back and we're seeing the same trends in April. So we still expect that what we talked about at the Investor Conference and continues to see slight improvement, we'll continue to see in 2017.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Hey. This is Alan. I just want to add that I think we reported back in the fourth quarter that B2B growth was negative. And while it was still slightly declining in the first quarter, it came \u2013 the quarter-over-quarter results are really big improvement and we saw that across more of the industry segments.", "Rich did mention that the brick-and-mortar slowed down, but we've got a great strategy moving forward to bring B2B back to positive. David talked about dangerous goods expansion. We've got some great things going on in healthcare, and certainly, the returns portfolio continues to generate great B2B.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning. I wanted to also ask on the domestic package margin. Richard, you identified I think the $50 million that you said was unusual. If I add that back in, I still get I think something like a 30-basis-point decline in domestic package margin. How would you think about that going forward? I mean, you commented a bit.", "Should we model margin improvement in the second quarter or second half in domestic package? And is that cost falling off or volume is accelerating? So I guess just in more kind of perspective on how these domestic package margin may play out this year. Thank you.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. Tom, as I had mentioned a moment ago, we still expect to see leverage. We knew going in that the startup costs for Saturday would be a little heavier in the first quarter because you have to put the investment in, in order to get the customers to bring in the volume that they need delivered on Saturday. And when we think about Saturday, we're thinking about not just deliveries, but we looked in Saturday operations because we are also doing pickups, which will actually leave sometime in transit for some of our customers.", "So when we put the year together, we do see an improvement in margin. We see leverage coming. We did know the first quarter, you would have more of the startup costs. But we also understand that through the year, we're investing to create the network and transform it and we're going to see that happening through the year, but we're also going to see revenue coming in to offset it.", "So I would look at the first quarter as being an example of how the margin looks. I would look at it as the dollar amount of investment is something that we will continue to have, but you'll see revenue continue to grow as well.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks. We're going to take a online question here, and this question comes from Jack Atkins. Jack's question is about the Freight Forwarding business. So, Jim, can you give us some color around Freight Forwarding business?", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure, Jack. It's Jim. On the Forwarding businesses, as we kind of opened with some of the opening comments, this is a really good quarter for us in Supply Chain & Freight all around.", "Specifically, in the Forwarding business, though, I think most of us would recognize the last couple years have been challenging and I think we used that as an opportunity at UPS to look at the business, restructure a bit, work on some overheads, and take a look at segmentation in the market and go at it differently. And what you saw then in the first quarter was about a year-and-a-half's worth of work and we see it continuing, quite frankly.", "We're looking at really strong growth in the middle market that is important for the mix. In that product offering, we've got balance across air freight, ocean and North America as well all growing double digits. So a very, very balanced distribution in Forwarding with bottom-line profitability approaching 20% year-over-year growth.", "So, we don't need a bunch of top line growth; we need just the right growth in the model for it to produce in a UPS forwarding unit. And so, we're pretty pleased with the first quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. David, I wanted to ask you perhaps a governance question. I was wondering if given the importance of managing this transition and stabilizing the domestic margin, if you and the board had any conversations about creating the proper incentives for management for the employees to actually kind of achieve that target and whether we can expect you to maybe talking about that in the future as far as helping to give investors some confidence that there's more skin in the game in terms of actually executing against what is a challenging transition for the business.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Well, David, to answer that question, obviously the board and myself, we're always looking for ways to tie in the best interest of the company but also the best interest of the leadership.", "And so, our compensation packages are highly oriented towards results. The variable pay is a much higher percentage than it is in many companies, and we feel like that we certainly are incenting the right things.", "Now, we look at it on a year-to-year basis because things do change and when they do, we would make those adjustments. But we focus on the top line, we focus on the bottom line. And one thing that makes our company a little bit different is we incent full results all the way down to the supervisor level.", "So we have our profit plan and we agree to that. We hold people accountable to it and it goes all the way down to that line supervisor. So, I'm very comfortable that we have it aligned correctly, but thank you for the question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask sort of about some of the comments in terms of the investment on the domestic side, and I think the view is that you'll incentivize growth as you're building out the network here. And I guess you also need to get price right, too. So I guess I'm just kind of wondering how you will manage sort of that balance between making sure you get the growth that you're building for, but also managing the price piece of it obviously to make sure that the returns on this new incremental investment are as good as what we normally have expected from you over the years.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Hey, Chris. This is Alan. Thanks for that question. Yeah. Look, I mean I think the pricing actions that we discussed on the last call were certainly visible in this quarter's results and we also generated some good volume growth with Next Day Air up 4%, Deferred up over 4%, and ground over 2%.", "The first quarter, U.S.-based pricing came in at the higher end of our 2% to 3% range. And some of the things we're doing, the annual GRI, we broadened the U.S. Domestic DIM divisor from 166 to the 139. The additional handling, the overmaxes, the new fuel surcharge, it's all being managed very, very tightly and well and we're very, very pleased with those results.", "I'd also just let you know on \u2013 Richard talked about peak and surcharge pricing that ensures pricing is aligned to cost to serve whether it's peak or in other parts of the year, and we've got a significant focus in that area also. And just a little color there on some of the objectives where we're really looking to set the market expectations for pricing to match the supply and demand.", "We're looking to cover the additional costs that we incur in those periods that lead up to and including peak as well as other periods of time where volume surges. And we're very, very focused on maintaining and improving the margins during peak. And then bottom line, always ensuring that we're protecting the integrity of the network for our customers with a great service that they've grown accustomed to.", "Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. So, first thing, I just wanted to clarify, in the press release in the International segment, when you talk about currency-neutral operating profit, does that suggest that currency is hurting first quarter 2017 results and the base is a lot higher or is it that it helped first quarter 2016? I just want to understand so we know the base to model for next year. So, just wanted to clarify that because I was confused.", "And then, more just broadly, can you just talk about the pricing in International and at LTL? Because it looks like really good volume growth in the quarter, but maybe pricing a little bit softer.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you for the question. It's quite a bit to that question. So, Richard, why don't you start the first? And then, Jim, if you follow up, I'd appreciate it.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So the question around the currency-neutral is there is an accounting standard as how you have to state those. And the accounting standard is that you use the last year because that's a published number. And so, what you'll see there is that's restating this year to last year. So for your models, you probably need to talk with Scott, but you would actually probably do it slightly different than what the accounting standard is.", "But the most important thing is, is that when you look at the International business, it's really a story of what we've seen the last two years. Jim talked a minute ago about the broad-based growth in Supply Chain and we're seeing the same thing in the International business.", "And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim to talk about.", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "I think, Scott, you also wanted to kind of touch on pricing in Forwarding. I would say that there was an event in the first quarter in the Asia market with about 20% of the capacity coming out of Shanghai market when five air carriers were put down with about 50 segments a day. So that actually allowed us and others to actually tighten up and focus on the margin and the pricing a little bit stronger.", "And it also saw business move from forwarding into small package and back and forth. So, with respect to in the first quarter and the pricing in flat environment of Forwarding, I would say it was the best for us in about two years.", "Our great margins continue to go way up, the bottom line continues to expand. We'll continue to do that. And we'll talk more, I think, in the upcoming calls about pricing in the small package around peak as well. We talk a lot about that in the Domestic market, but International has a role and responsibility to play there as well and we're evolving and maturing in that segment as well. So we'll talk more about that as we approach peak.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Oh, we're going to take a online question. This one is regarding, can you talk more about Coyote and how the business is growing in the marketplace?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. This is Alan. So, yeah, Coyote is really continuing to see strong year-on-year double-digit growth rates in loads. The UPS customer base is certainly highly predisposed to the truckload services that Coyote's offering. Service levels are really remaining consistently high.", "As I think most of us know, the truckload market remains soft. We are seeing some signs of tightening, but this asset-light model really does provide great flexibility in the up and down cycles.", "Synergies are on track. We expect to get about $100 million of that for 2017 and we're seeing them across the board in procurement, backhaul, asset utilization, cross-selling, and some of that's dropping obviously to the Domestic and Supply Chain/Freight segments.", "The last thing I'll say is that we've landed on the European continent with our Freightex acquisition where we're really excited about that. And we've expanded into Mexico also in addition to Canada. So we're really excited about taking the European \u2013 or the Coyote model abroad and things are going very, very well. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Great. Good morning. It sounds, David, like you were talking a bit about the accelerated rollout. I just want to understand, are you speeding up the timeframe or is this the same time you talked about back in February in terms of the 17 facilities? And is that something that you could accelerate?", "And similarly, on your Saturday delivery, you talked about going from 15 metro areas to 4,700 cities. Is that a hiring move or scheduling for drivers that takes time to roll that out? Thanks.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "All right. I'll take the first part of the question and then Myron will answer about the Saturday delivery.", "The theme of our recent management conference was about going forward fast. And we're looking at every bit of our strategy and seeing where can we ramp up facilities, where can we ramp up implementation of technology in all of our investments.", "We feel like the schedule that we have, and we're right on top of that schedule, Rich talked about what the CapEx was for the first quarter and it leads up right to the yearly average. So we're right on plan there. But if we can open up some of these buildings a little earlier, that is our focus.", "We're going to do them right. We're going to implement them right. But we're looking in all regards to be able to answer our customers' needs and to do it as quickly as possible. And Saturday Air is a good example of that. We've got a pretty aggressive plan. And Myron, you want to talk about that?", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. Ken, we're actually on schedule for our deployments. We opened up 40 buildings in the first quarter that impacted 15 major metro areas and we hope to \u2013 well, we will complete over 200 scheduled facilities for Saturday in the back half of this year.", "Early adoption from our customers has been extremely positive, but we like to look at it as full Saturday operations. And the combination of picking up on Saturday and delivering on Monday has proven to be a real market advantage for all of our customers. Particularly, when you look at a number of fulfillment houses that are locating closer to their customer base. They're telling us that this added capability is really working very well for them.", "So we're pleased with our progress to-date and if we can speed up, we certainly will. Thank you.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I think the Pulse of the Online Shopper reports that EPS puts out are pretty informative, and we've seen recently one of the big-box retailers offered discounts for items online, purchased online that aren't in the store. If a consumer is willing to pick it up in the store, they'll get a discount off of that.", "So, just wondering how you see consumer behavior moving throughout your forecast period here and if you expect shippers will start to offer similar discounts to consumers, and if that's something that you expect will kind of help with density and help relieve some of the B2C pressure across all the networks that we're seeing recently. Thank you.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. Brian. This is Alan. Yeah. I think that one of the takeaways from the Pulse of the Online Shoppers are that the consumers want to get their packages when and where they want to when they're ordering online.", "And that program you talk about, the base of that program has been out there for quite some time and now, folks are beginning to put promotional programs around that model and that will drive potentially more ship-to-store type of volume for UPS, which is certainly B2B, which is great business for us.", "We're really focused on what the needs and the wants are of these consumers that we can tailor our services for the retailers so that they can win. And that really comes back to our omnichannel strategies which have ship-to-store \u2013 ship-from-store, store-to-store, our returns portfolio, along with UPS Access Points and My Choice. And I think Saturday deliveries and Saturday operations with pickup is just another great example of how we're working to build that e-commerce value stack to make sure that we're capturing share in that particular piece of the market profitably.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Hartford with Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. I don't know if Juan's on the line. If not, maybe this question is for Jim. But curious about kind of emergence of blockchain technology and any sort of implications it may have for the International business, for Freight Forwarding specifically, and I guess most specifically customs brokerage. I know you guys have a large presence there. So, any perspective you might have on the implications from blockchain either negatively or positively? How you see that developing would be helpful. Thanks.", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. I would say, Ben, the whole Hyperledger that sits beneath it does have application in many parts of our business. And I think, obviously, we had questions \u2013 David had so far \u2013 about some of the investments and other ones we're looking at and how we speed those up.", "There is a rhythm to this, obviously. We are the world's largest customs broker. That's a big business that it needs to be innovated and blockchain is one of \u2013 along with the likes of artificial intelligence, and obviously, we've got the Trade Facilitation Agreement that now has come across under World Trade Organization.", "So, yes, it's in there. It's in many pieces of our business, including other parts of Forwarding. We don't want to get too far \u2013 ahead of ours skis here and talk about it today on the call. But I think as it evolves and we put more of it in the market, we'll point to that in the calls and how it's really impacting both customers and the bottom line of business. And I think Rich has a couple comments as well.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. When you think about the potential of a blockchain, we see a tremendous amount not just in the areas Jim talked about, but also even in how customers and suppliers \u2013 our customers who are fulfilling transact. And so we do think there's a lot of potential there.", "And that's one of the reasons that David actually created the Advanced Technology and Engineering Group is to make sure we stay in front of the latest in technology, figuring out where the best business uses are. Sometimes there'll be many. We may start with one and then apply it differently across the entire network.", "So we are watching that very carefully. And between our Advanced Technology Group as well as our Strategic Enterprise Fund, we will find where the best use is, but one of the things we have to make sure is the right and proper controls in the ownership of the data that's there before we can start putting it into the integrity of our systems.", "Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "That's great. Thank you.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take an online question. This comes from Dave Ross and it's about the International volumes and how we should think about it being related to specific market share gains and the global economy broadly. So, Jim?", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So, David, I guess before I go right to the answer, I want to kind of drop back because I think for us, internationally, this was a pretty unique quarter for us. It was what I consider the culmination of a couple years of work and it's got long runway ahead of it to continue.", "We talked a little bit about this at the conference \u2013 I did, specifically \u2013 investment conference in February about the flywheel effect, and that's exactly what's going on in the business right now.", "It's the combination of the right investments in the network over the last couple years. We put some new governance models in place to run the business in really good opportunity places like the Middle East and North America. We got new partnership models that are running in our emerging markets and really pretty strong senior leadership cadence in International today. I'm pretty \u2013 very, very satisfied with that.", "So we go back to your question on where's the growth, is it economic? Is it the model? I'd say it's 90% model right now in UPS. And the reason I say that is if you look at places like Europe, for instance, we just completed the first quarter and saw over 15% intra-European growth, which is \u2013 where most of that piece of the business stays in Europe. That's not economic; that's just a model producing great, great benefits for customers who are choosing UPS at faster and faster rates than they ever had before.", "So we do see it continuing, we've got the emerging markets going forward as well and we had a really strong quarter in both China and all of Asia Pacific, and it's balanced. Really, if you look at across all of International right now, in my 15 years, I've never seen so many double digits in so many places at the same time. And finally, I think we've got in the new governance model in our U.S. North America export operation, it's starting to move like it hasn't in the past as well.", "So, I think it's the business model, I think it's leadership at UPS out in the field and also working with Myron's folks in the U.S. as great partners because it has to come in and out of the U.S. at the same time. So, we're pretty pleased with the first quarter and we expect it to continue going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will come from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hi, good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking our question.", "Historically, you discussed returning about 100% of net income through dividends and buybacks. So just wondering, while you're in your investment phase, what do you think is the more reasonable range to expect? And do you plan to get back to 100% after the investment cycle is completed?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Danny, this is Richard. I think the first thing that \u2013 when we're looking at the use of capital, we try to think about what's the best use given all the different opportunities in front of UPS to continue to grow the business. So, of course, with our high return on invested capital, our first goal is to reinvest in the business, grow the profits, and for the next three to five years, we did call out a higher CapEx.", "We also think it's important to have a strong return to our investors, and we have called out that our dividends are 50% to 55% of net income and that still is a priority. And then we've kind of given you a range on the buybacks between $1 billion and $1.8 billion. And the reason we gave the range was because as opportunities are created, we have to make sure we're evaluating what's in the best interest long term for the investors. Continuing to harvest the return on invested capital, growing the base, creating more value while returning to the shareholders.", "So, as we get through this next cycle, we'll see what new opportunities come and we'll make the appropriate decision. And through that process, we'll continue to do what we've always done and that's share it with our investors.", "Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for getting me on the call here.", "So, David, I guess following up off the response to that question and something you talked about earlier with a balanced top-line and bottom-line focus. We can definitely see in your Domestic business, if we go back four years, I think your revenue is up 15%. If we go up even farther, we can call it 30%, 40% growth. But we're just not seeing it translate into the bottom line.", "So, clearly, from our perspective, it looks like there's a very sharp market share focus at UPS. But why not maybe take a little bit more of that top line in price? Why not slow down the volume growth until you can get some of these initiatives in place? I guess just educate us from an outsider's perspective why we should care so much about volume and lower margins today and hope that these investments can drive better returns in the future.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. Well, I'll start out that question and then we'll go to Richard. But, first, I have to tell you that we look at it a little bit differently than you do. So I appreciate your opinion, but we believe that it needs to be a very balanced approach.", "We have talked today and Alan shared that we were at the top end of our range that we're looking at the 2% to 3% of increasing our pricing. But he also talked about the surge pricing and what we're going to do there to make sure that our costs are covered, especially during those high points of the year where capacity is tight. So, I don't believe we're putting less emphasis on pricing. I think that we have wrapped up the emphasis on pricing.", "We have also shared with you that we're going to see positive operating leverage in the U.S. this year. We knew that we were going to have some investment costs at the beginning of the year that would not have as much revenue coming in as it will in the later part of the year.", "But we really feel the key is we have to be balanced. We have to continue to work on our costs. We want to grow the business. We want to grow it in the right direction and we're putting a lot of businesses in that area, and we're going to make sure that we're pricing right.", "So, Richard, I may not have given you a lot of wiggle room, but go ahead and follow up on a couple of the things.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. When we look at how we're doing and what we're doing today, we are investing in the network and we're not investing in the network for the next quarter or the next year. It's really about generationally and about the long term.", "There has been a fundamental shift in how our market has been created for small package. The time period you were talking about, you can go back and you'll see there was a much larger B2B. The number of people buying online was much lower. And so, our market is expanding, but the way people are receiving merchandise is different. And we're preparing this company and our network to make the adjustments for that.", "And then the other thing that I don't think we expected to see the last few years was really how slow IP was. Now, we do see IP starting to recover, but we're also balancing that with a lot of brick-and-mortars redoing their model and adjusting.", "So, it's really about the investment, getting to $800 million to $1 billion in savings and avoidance we called out. And we think over the long term and as we complete the transformation of the network, you'll see that all of the efforts we put in not only bring back the return on invested capital at the highest in the industry, but the margins are appropriate as we have guided at the Investor Conference as well.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Let's take a online question. We have another question that has come in on what the corporate tax rate of 15% that has been mentioned in the press. So, David?", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We heard this yesterday and so we're not prepared to quantify what the advantage for us would be. But I can tell you, it would be very, very positive.", "And we are a high-taxed corporation. We've told you that we expect our rate to be 35% \u2013 effective rate 35% this year. So we're very encouraged by what we're hearing.", "And we know we're early in the process, but we support and have supported for a long time comprehensive tax reform. We certainly felt like the tax rate needed to be lowered. We have competition based in other countries that is paying a much, much less tax rate. And we do believe that a competitive international tax system was extremely important.", "So, the initial results we got from yesterday, we felt good about it. We look forward to working with Congress and the administration on this legislation, but we think that it will help American companies be more competitive. We think it will drive jobs, and we're very excited about the potential. So thank you for the question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks. Morning, everyone. A couple of questions. First, can you specifically quantify the impact of the facility fire in the quarter? And second, on last mile warehousing, as B2C becomes a larger part of your business going forward, do you see the need to shift your operating footprint and your warehousing footprint to be closer to the customer? And if you could elaborate on some of the initiatives you're taking in your investment plan to do that. Thanks.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So I'll take the first part of the question around the fire and then I'll pass it off to Jim to talk about the distribution question.", "But Ravi, if you look at what we put out and I think when you see this quarter, we tried to give as much transparency as possible and full visibility to the onetimes, what was happening with fuel as prices change and increase as well as what was going on with the currency.", "But at the end, you can kind of pretty much figure that the big change in both the weather and the fire combined was about $20 million, and that could be laid out based on the math that we have there. And those were things we weren't (53:32) at the same time, we had another benefit in the tax that kind of offset that.", "But at the end of the day, those two combined kind of wash out. But the fire wasn't something we expected. The operation has made all the proper repairs. The building is back open, and the businesses continue to run in that facility. But it was something that we did feel like we need to call out.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "And I'll take the second part. This is David and not Jim. But on warehousing and the need for it to be closer, I'll give you a couple of things. First is \u2013 and Alan talked about our omnichannel strategy earlier. And we do believe and especially with some of the brick-and-mortar companies, they're looking at how they can compete with large e-commerce companies. And so, working with us on being able to hit the customer the next day or in two days \u2013 and we've had a lot of good discussions and we believe that we are the best answer when it comes to those retail solutions that's out there.", "Another thing, though, that we're certainly seeing progress is these midsized customers, that they really want to be able to compete with that time in transit. They could never build the warehousing in order to do that. So that has been our focus over the last few months and will continue to be is how we can use our available facilities and give these midsized customers very similar coverage to what the larger companies would have, and that would be based on our small package network, but it's based on Jim's distribution and warehousing network. And we see that as a very good opportunity for us and we're continuing to work with our customers in those areas. So thank you for the questions.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. We're going to take another online question. This question comes out \u2013 some news that came out here this morning, late yesterday afternoon about the Defense Department awarding UPS a contract for services. Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. Look, we're certainly excited to have been awarded that shipping contract for the next five years. The contract is for small package global shipping and custom services and covers the U.S. Military and a host of other government agencies. And it will commence in the fourth quarter of 2017.", "We're actually one of the leading providers to the U.S. government today, and this enables the U.S. government to continue receiving the value they get from those UPS services. And it's also going to provide us with some significant opportunities to grow our business with the U.S. government, while helping them create better efficiencies and value for them and their customers. So we're really excited about that opportunity. Thanks.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to follow up with another online question about synthetic density and what we're doing to create synthetic density in our business models as we build up these investments.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. We've talked about synthetic density before and how it is important to improve the residential stop density, and we've got quite a few initiatives that we're focusing on there. We've seen some improvements and we think there's a lot of potential. So it is something that we talk to our customers about, especially the large shippers, the large e-commerce, the large brick-and-mortar shippers.", "So, Alan, do you want to get into a little bit more detail about synthetic density?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. I would just start out by saying that when you look at really our whole UPS e-commerce value stack, almost everything we're doing there has a component of creating synthetic density, while at the same time, providing great value to the retailers and the consumers that enjoy those services.", "We all know about SurePost and SurePost Redirect, and Redirect was up about 10% for the quarter year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter. Some of the other services like UPS Access Point where the shipper from their web portal can direct their consumers to UPS Access Points, both for their convenience or for the retailer to achieve a lower cost, while UPS ends up with a more profitable shipment.", "They can also \u2013 on 35 million now My Choice users are redirecting a lot of their packages to these access points and then, obviously, our not in ones, when we miss you at home, we're redirecting those to access points. So that's kind of, like I've said before, the Swiss Army knife of getting consumers' deliveries in a profitable way.", "We're rolling out about 300 lockers in the U.S. We've already got 200 of them out there and they're another way for us to make that synthetic density. And you've heard us talk about SDS, Synchronized Delivery Solutions, where the match is created before the package ever leaves the shipper.", "And then last, but not least is returns, which we're going to continue to drive. We've just added Optoro to our industry-leading returns value proposition, and that's going to enable customers to optimize the value for disposition of those returns goods.", "And then last, but not least is that the \u2013 one-tenth of a piece per stop on delivery density increases our operating profit by $200 million. So we're extremely focused on continuing to drive this synthetic density.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes our Q&A today. Now, I'll turn the program back over to Scott.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "I want to thank everyone for the questions today. We really appreciate it. David?", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "All right. Just a couple closing comments. We're making good progress on our building of the smart global logistics network.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Good morning, and welcome to the UPS second quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language.

These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term and strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.", "Now I will turn the call over to David.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this year we stepped up our pace of investment to accelerate the most sweeping transformation of our network in decades. We are investing heavily in new capacity and connected technology to capture the tremendous e-commerce and international growth opportunities we see. We are creating the next generation UPS smart, global, logistics network, to fuel long-term, profitable growth and enhanced share-owner value. Our performance in the first half of the year strengthens our confidence that we are on the right track. UPS delivered good results in the second quarter, driven by strong revenue and high margins in all three of our reporting segments. We are pleased with this progress.", "Our U.S. segment delivered more than 13% operating profit growth as daily shipments accelerated and package yields improved. The International segment continues to produce outstanding results, including robust growth and high margins, even in the face of currency headwinds. And the Supply Chain & Freight group is producing more favorable results as they reposition the business to achieve greater profitability as market conditions improve. As we look forward to the rest of this year, growth in the global economy is expected to increase moderately as the year progresses and UPS is well positioned to reap the benefits.", "The latest U.S. GDP forecast for the balance of the year remains unchanged. Industrial production in retail are still growing, although at a slower pace than originally projected. Online purchases, as a percent of retail, grew once again in the latest forecast. Growth rates in Europe are expected to continue to be resilient, with most economies rising. And in Asia, the outlook for China has improved, with growth in that market now exceeding the previous forecast.", "The export market remains solid and we are aggressively positioning UPS products and network capability to take full advantage of cross-border expansion. I was recently in Detroit to deliver a keynote address at Gateway 2017, a conference hosted by Alibaba. The event drew about 3,000 participants, mostly from small- and mid-sized American companies interested in exporting to China.", "China represents a great market opportunity for U.S. businesses. We are creating special cross-border services to support customers who want to sell to Chinese consumers via e-commerce. These services, along with our recently announced joint venture with SF Express, will enable us to leverage the vast reach of both companies. We have plans to add competitive shipping products in more international lanes as we expand the SF partnership.", "In addition to providing trade-enabling solutions, UPS also supports government efforts to further expand trade. We applaud the recent agreement in principle to create the EU and Japan Free Trade Agreement. This is an important step towards developing the kind of open, rules-based trade system our customers need to conduct business across global markets.", "UPS will continue to advocate around the globe for trade legislation that enables businesses and consumers alike to shop the world with ease. This also enables businesses to compete on a level playing field.", "In addition, we continued to expand our capabilities and presence in international markets in the second quarter. We announced our acquisition of Nightline, the leading small-package company in Ireland, while in May, UPS was proud to be selected as the official logistics partner for Expo 2020 in Dubai. In fact, we've already started to leverage this exclusive partnership to accelerate our growth in the Middle East. These announcements bring the number of partnerships and acquisitions we've entered to 13 over the last few years. Going forward, we will continue to look for creative ways to expand our capabilities, our market presence, and the reach of our network in ways that build long-term value.", "This quarter, we also announced significant hub modernization and expansion projects in Arizona and Kansas, and we broke ground on our fourth new regional hub, located in Indiana. The regional hub projects will add more than 4 million square feet of highly-automated capacity, while also creating high-quality jobs for thousands of part-time and full-time UPSers. This new capacity is critical for us to support our customers' growth and deliver the UPS services they demand. Once underway, these new facilities will improve our performance throughout the year and help us to deliver efficiently during peak demand periods.", "At the same time, we are also working to ensure that we align our pricing with our cost to serve. Last month, we announced peak-season surcharges and we are addressing the impact with customers as we develop peak shipping forecasts for later this year. These surcharges are necessary to ensure UPS continues to provide customers with the best-in-class value and highly reliable service they've come to expect.", "Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to mention that next month UPS will celebrate our 110th year in business. It's incredible how far we've come, from a small bicycle messenger service to the leading global logistics provider. Let me express my thanks for the hard work and dedication of those who came before us, as well as the 434,000 UPSers today whose efforts are contributing to our success.", "In summary, we just finished another strong quarter for UPS. And we are moving quickly to build our smart, global logistics network, ensuring continued success into the future.", "Now Richard will take you through the details of our results. Richard?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this year, we laid out our 2017 full year plans, as well as our three-year target. At the midpoint of the year, the business is performing as we expected and we are pleased with our progress. Looking closely at the second quarter, total revenue increased 7.7%. Adjusting for currency, top line growth was nearly 9%. The revenue was balanced across all segments with shipment growth throughout the product portfolio. Earnings per share were $1.58, up almost 11% over last year with good, core performance within the segments. In addition, there were several items that positively contributed to the quarter. Most of these were expected.", "First, net fuel year-over-year was a benefit. In 2016, fuel prices accelerated through the quarter from April through June. At the time, we had a two-month fuel surcharge revenue delay and were unable to offset the increase in fuel prices. In early February, we adopted a two-week revenue lag. In addition, there were other fuel policy changes that increased the overall revenue-to-expense coverage ratio.", "Another positive contribution occurs as a result of lower workers' compensation cost in the second quarter. We've gone to quarterly, rather than semi-annual, outside independent studies to refine our estimates of our workers' compensation liability. Finally, it was a one-time benefit that the Supply Chain & Freight segment received this quarter. Together these three contributed approximately $0.10 per share. The majority of the benefit came from fuel and workers' compensation that we had anticipated.", "Now, let's turn to the details of each segment. In the U.S., revenue increased more than 8% due to several factors; volume growth, Easter in the second quarter, and higher fuel surcharges, which added about 120 basis points. Total shipments increased almost 5% with growth accelerating across the products. Deferred Air led the way, up 11%, and Next Day Air was up more than 6%. Ground shipments also increased more than 4%, driven by SurePost and residential deliveries. Strong B2C expansion continued with growth in the low teens. And despite the acceleration of brick-and-mortar store closings, B2B has sequentially improved and moved into positive territory.", "Yield management initiatives contributed to revenue-per-package growth of 3% during the quarter. Strong base rates and higher fuel surcharges offset product mix changes. Operating costs were pressured by higher fuel prices. In addition, the cost penalties associated with 20 projects under construction and the deployment of Saturday operations continued in the second quarter, but were offset by the workers' compensation benefits I mentioned earlier.", "Operating profit increased 13% to $1.4 billion and margin expanded 60 basis points to 14.3%. The strong shipment growth, combined with the UPS initiatives, contributed to the gains.", "Now turning to the International segment, which delivered another quarter of good top line growth, combined with positive operating leverage on a currency-neutral basis. International revenue increased 2.8%. Adjusted for currency, growth was 8.3%. Demand for our unmatched export solutions remained high as shipments were up 12%. Europe continues to lead the way, with mid-teens growth to key trade lanes and intra-Europe. The Asia-to-U.S. trade lane remained strong with double-digit growth again this quarter. Reported operating profit was $583 million down 4.9%. After adjusting for currency, operating profit expanded almost 14% to $697 million. As a reminder, you can review our currency-neutral results on the web schedules.", "Now, looking at Supply Chain & Freight, the segment produced another solid quarter of financial results. Revenue was up 12% and reported operating profit improved by 24%. Year-over-year gains in operating profit included a benefit from a legal settlement. When removing the impact of this $20 million one-time item, profit growth was still very strong. All the major supply chain business units contributed to the improvements this quarter. In forwarding, tonnage increased across all three products with International airfreight growth in the mid-teens, and North American air and ocean freight up mid-single digits.", "Distribution revenue increased at a low-single-digit pace, as strong growth in retail, aerospace and mail services were mostly offset by declines in the high-tech sector. Operating profit and margin improved over 2016. UPS freight revenue was up 9% on strong LTL tonnage gains of more than 8% as market conditions in U.S. trucking industry continue to recover. Operating profit and margins improved as the business continued to focus on growth from middle-market customers. Through the first two quarters of 2017, we are encouraged by the gains all the business units are making within the Supply Chain & Freight segment.", "Now, let's turn to cash flow. UPS ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and marketable securities as the business continued to generate strong returns. We are focusing our capital on building the smart logistics network, creating flexibility through a strong balance sheet and distributing returns to our shareholders. On a year-to-date basis, capital expenditures are $2 billion, putting us on track to lead our CapEx guidance range of 6% to 7% of revenue. In late June, we announced changes to our non-union U.S. pension. This change stabilizes our risk obligation and lowers the liability on our balance sheet. We are moving to a pay-as-you-go, enhanced 401(k)-style plan starting in January 2023. The new plan will be more predictable and sustainable.", "Moving to shareholder returns, at this point in the year, we have distributed about $2.3 billion. We have repurchased more than 8.4 million shares for just over $900 million and paid out nearly $1.4 billion in dividends up over 6% per share over the last year.", "Now I want to discuss our guidance. Through the first two quarters we've had good performance as we expected. My earlier comments outlined favorable items from the second quarter, including fuel, the change in workers' compensation, and the one-time benefit in Supply Chain & Freight. We expect minimal impact from these items in the second half of the year. Looking forward, our plans are influenced by the previously announced currency headwinds and a few other moving parts.", "In the third quarter, considering the combination of currently known and anticipated factors, including one less operating day, earnings per share should be relatively flat when compared to last year. In the second half of the year, our tax rate will be about 35%. Keep in mind, in the fourth quarter of 2016 we had tax benefits of approximately $0.05 per share. This benefit is not expected to repeat in the fourth quarter of 2017, which will weigh on the comparison. In addition to the quarterly items, we continue to monitor both the economic and business trends that impact our business. Externally, we've looked at all the currently available data and our internal plans, and we're confident in reaffirming our 2017 guidance for earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, which includes about $400 million in unfavorable currency impact.", "At this point in the year, we are right where we expected to be and we are encouraged by the progress across all three segments. The entire enterprise is responding well and making the necessary adjustments to generate solid performance as we execute on our revenue and strategic initiatives. At the same time, we are investing aggressively, implementing Saturday operations, acquiring new capabilities, and buildings partnerships to grow the business. Through the first six months of the year, our proven strategy and operational flexibility has provided the targeted financial results we expected and the company is on track to achieve the goals we laid out earlier this year.", "Before I turn it over to the operator, I want to remind you that the webcast users can submit live questions during today's call.", "Thank you for your time, and now I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, please ask only one question so that we may accommodate more callers. Feel free to get back into the queue and we will take a second question, time permitting. We will now take our first question from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. Great. Thank you, and good morning. I wanted to ask on the \u2013 you showed strength, I guess, across the board in volumes; in particular, international export was very good. I wanted to see if you could comment on the drivers of that, and also perhaps the competitive environment. It appears there's some issues with TNT and the cyberattack and so forth. And I guess that didn't affect you in the quarter, but is that something that could potentially be a meaningful opportunity that would boost your export even further? Thank you.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for the question. This is David. And I'm going to start with the first part about the cyberattack and how it may have affected volume, and \u2013 because there were a lot of parts to that question. But on that, first thing I wanted to say is we obviously don't wish cyberattacks on any company. I mean, these things are criminal acts and I know that we all take them seriously. And from a UPS standpoint, we are regularly investing in updating our technologies to protect, not only our customers, but our employee and company data and also, of course, our service levels because we know how important that can be. So, as far as how that or other things have affected our volume, Jim, I'll turn it over to you.", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, David. Tom, I guess it's a pretty wide question, but I guess I'll come back to openly the growth drivers as we talked about last quarter. It's very balanced, but this last quarter Europe did have our highest growth rate underpinning the 12% export you referenced. On the back of David's comments, straight up, yes, we are seeing more business recently in Europe, but I also would point you to a couple of key factors here.", "First of all, no matter what's going on in any marketplace, customers have choice. And the choices they have in Europe, because of this unfortunate situation, are between us and many other competitors. I think the way we're looking at this is that through the last couple years we've talked about our investments in the network and new products, like our recently announced dangerous goods capabilities, continued expansion of the network, and in those cases, those seem to certainly be resonating and we \u2013 they are choosing UPS. Our job is to serve them going forward and continue to invest in the network as we go. So \u2013 and, certainly, I do want to reinforce what David said. This is not a situation that we would certainly wish on anyone and we know we have a job to do and serve whatever customers are on our network. So appreciate that.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Richard, can you help us understand where the $0.10 benefit you guys called out sits across the operating segments? And I just want to make sure \u2013 or help there \u2013 if you could even maybe help me understand, if the underlying profit growth in the domestic segment has kind of come back into the positive territory, if you were to adjust for some of this noise, whether it's the $35 million or whatever portion of the $0.10 you want to put into the domestic segment?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. Actually, a large portion of it is in domestic and there also is in international. If you look back to 2016, David, what you would have seen is that the fuel prices were increasing between 35% and 40% during the quarter. You recall we were still a two-month lag. So, for example, while fuel price per barrel was somewhere in the mid-$40s on average for the second quarter, we were still using February's revenue to create surcharge, and that was $31 a barrel at the time. So it's really about a year-over-year and, actually, I went back and looked and we talked about last year on this same second quarter call that we had some headwinds because of that fuel change. Fortunately, we'd made that adjustment and what happened last year, cost actually kind of got pretty tight the rest of the year. And so, we expected in our plans that we would see a benefit because of the drag last year on that.", "On the workers' comp, what's really happened is because we're now doing quarterly studies instead of just twice a year, we've moved some of the benefit that we traditionally see in the third quarter into second quarter. And so, generally speaking, what we're trying to do is marry up with our actual experience in a more meaningful way on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so we made that method up, that change, because we thought that was more prudent and also to understand how the business was really going.", "When you look at the second half of the year, we expect to have a strong second half of the year, good results. We talked about a few of the items that you have to take into consideration, but we feel like when you look at all the data that we've seen, we feel confident that the range that we've given you is something that we're going to deliver when you get to the second half. Thank you.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "But if you think about that $0.10, is it like 70/30 domestic/international, like is there any kind of rough line on that?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "I would say between 70/30 and 80/20, somewhere in that range.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Somewhere in that range. Thanks very much.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take an international or an online question. And this question comes from Jack Atkins. Jack asks, you know that the double-digit revenue growth at Coyote, is Coyote continuing to hit your expectations for $200 million of increment EBITDA by the end of this year?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Hey. This is Alan. I'm going to take that question. As you know, we were continuing to see strong year-over-year growth. We are growing market share with the service offering that we have in place. The service levels remain consistently high and we're continuing to innovate with technological solutions. The GL market is tightening, but the asset-light model is providing flexibility in the up-and-down cycles. We do have pressure on the contractual committed freight, but we also see opportunities and upside with the backup in spot markets.", "The key here is that the connectivity remains a real strength for us, both from a customer value creation and a synergy perspective. Our synergies are on track. We expect to get about $100 million for 2017 and that's coming in the form of procurement, back haul, asset utilization, cross-selling, and organizational synergies. And then, last, I'll just say that the cross selling is really producing several great wins this year and we are targeting the rich opportunities in the UPS customer base, specifically on the small/medium business side for greater yields. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "We have a question from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. It sounds like, clearly, a lot of momentum in B2C domestically. I'm curious with regard to B2B, what kind of trends did you see second quarter, first half? And do you anticipate, assuming that that's been picking up, that perpetuating into the second half and any color you can provide particularly with regard to the retail? Thanks.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yes. So, this is Alan. I'll take that question. As we noted, the B2B in the second quarter expanded slightly versus last year. So we saw low-single digit growth there and we saw improvement across many industry segments. From a quarter-over-quarter basis, we are back in positive territory so we did see a good sequential jump off the negative results the last couple of quarters.", "Our e-commerce customers are driving both B2C and B2B shipments higher. Returns growth continues to be strong. And then on the Air side, you saw our Air growth was really the story this quarter with Next Day Air growing at 6.4% and Deferred growing at 11%. So we are seeing good growth there also. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "Chris Wetherbee, Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Great. Thanks for taking the call. I guess I want to talk a little about the second half of the year. So, as I'm listening to sort of the outlook and guidance that you have there, the third quarter is flat I think on an EPS basis. Midpoint suggests a little bit down in the fourth quarter but, I know you have tax dynamics playing out there but with the peak season surcharges and some of the momentum from a top-line perspective, I guess, I just would have thought it would have been a little bit higher than that. So I was just wondering if you could help us a little bit to sort of understand maybe top line dynamics as well as some of the cost assumptions embedded particularly around the peak season in that second half outlook?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure, this is Richard and I think that to start with, Chris, what you said is right. When you look at the first half of the year, we're right on plan. The U.S. business is adapting well. International continues to, as Jim mentioned, to have good growth, and supply chain is recovering. As we looked, though, at the current data, what we also noticed is although we are seeing some positive trends in many of the different industry types in B2B, we're a little challenged because the number of stores that are closing is having an impact on growth in the B2B. And so the forecast for B2B, if you go back earlier in the year to today, is not quite as strong because of retail sales and also because industrial production forecasts were higher even three months ago to where they are today.", "So we took that information and we looked at that against also some of the items that we called out that won't repeat in the second half of the year and we put it all together and we just didn't see enough new data that would suggest at this time we should adjust guidance. Obviously, as in the past, if more information comes in and it's appropriate to suggest a change, we would communicate it appropriately. But, at this point, based on \u2013 we're adjusting to how the volume and the customer demand is changing and we feel comfortable with where we're at.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Richard did a good job explaining the puts and takes for the fourth quarter. And I just want to make it very clear, as Richard and our team knows, we expect to have a very good fourth-quarter from a service standpoint and we expect to have good financial results. And we have been working on that throughout the year. So a lot of confidence there. Okay. Next question, please.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take an online question. We've got a few questions regarding one of the joint ventures that we're recently forming. So the question is, can you speak about the recent announcement, the joint venture with SF and when do you expect the transaction to close?", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So, this is Jim. I'll pick it up. A couple of things to note here. I start with some comments David made in his opening talk about this term of partnerships. When we announced our emerging market strategy a couple of years ago, we firmly founded pieces of that on expanded partnerships across the globe. This relationship with SF Express in China really does fit firmly into that. If you know much about the company, its headquarters are founded in the same province that we have our Air hub in Southern China in Guangdong. They have been in business since 1993. Arguably, they're the domestic leader in the B2B and B2C space. They combine with our brand and our International export capabilities in China and it was one of those markets that we all have to evaluate and make strategic moves.", "We're super excited about it. We are waiting for the final regulatory approvals to come through but when it does, we believe it opens up segments of the market that we are better off to partner with SF and the leadership than go it alone and hence the JV announcement and we look forward to the regulatory approval and then talking more about that in the quarters and years to come.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)", "Great. Good morning. Richard, that was great insight on the outlook for the volume side. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about pricing. We saw a big ramp in the ground pricing and maybe you could talk a bit about the surcharges coming up for peak season. Is that kind of automatic for every customer? Are there still contract customers you have to go renegotiate with? Maybe you can just talk about that given the ramp up we're seeing on the pricing as we head into the back half of the year.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "As bad as Richard wants to answer that question, I think we're going to let Alan do it because that's really more Alan's focus area. So, Alan?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, David. Yes, as you noted, the base pricing did come in at the higher end of our 2% to 3% range. That both happened in U.S. and International, when you look at International currency neutral.", "So certainly the GRI, the Dim weight, the additional handling and then our ongoing focus on contract management is paying off. Specifically, to peak, as you know, the peak season surcharge is really designed to compensate for the additional cost that we incur during peak with the volume increases, the temporary capacity enhancements that we need to meet the service levels that David talked about a bit earlier.", "And while these rate increases, even for a short time, are rarely welcome, our customers really understand and appreciate the value of our network, what we do to provide the service and the capacity for them at peak and year around as well as the cost of doubling of the network. The peak surcharge just \u2013 a few details here. The surcharge is designed to hit the most impacted weeks where we surge in both residential and large packages. And so, for Ground, it's three weeks of the five weeks of peak and for Air, it's only one week, the last week, and then for large package it's five. And our expectations are to have high compliance with the peak season surcharge.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)", "Great. Thank you. Just on the last question, is it on \u2013 do you have to renegotiate with each contract or is this something you're allowed to by contract add-ins?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. This is a published surcharge that affects the tariff. Thanks.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ben Hartford, Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, good morning, guys. A question for Jim. Jim, you touched on this earlier sort of the International Air Freight capacity dynamics. I'm curious where you think the industry is in kind of in the context of the broader cycle. We've had several years of excess capacity in that globally on the Air Freight side. It seems as though it's tightened up. Load factors have improved. There are some anecdotes of some forwarders putting charter capacity into the market as well. So where do you think we are cyclically as it relates to industry Air Freight supply/demand? Has that helped International parcel yields at all and what are your second half peak expectations from an Air Freight point of view? Thanks.", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Let me focus on the first question, I guess, on the capacity because there were a couple of them in there certainly. I think we're in a very unique position right now. It started about three quarters ago when some of the air capacity was taken out of the network. A lot of it came out of Shanghai, but certainly it moved south into Southern China and into Hong Kong.", "Usually, at this time of the year, you see a slack time in the Air Freight market. In fact, we haven't seen a slack. We've seen demand continue to roar. That's being affected in the buy-sell spreads and we're managing through that like everyone is in the market. The capacity issues as well are over on the express side of the business. The demand is high.", "David referenced some of that as well with the economy. So the Chinese engine over there is certainly going. You know, we've got some 747-8s on order. They're coming soon. They can't get here soon enough because our customers continue to choose the products and services.", "But back to the Air Freight, it is very unique. I think the next couple quarters leading up to peak will be very different from potentially some of the past. We're here very early and we've got to manage through that and then, of course, you've got the other options below in the ocean freight situation as well. So it is unique market and I believe we are managing through it very well. You can see that in some of the results and we look forward to continuing the ability to adapt to conditions as they come at us. So thanks for the question.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Jim mentioned those additional 747-8s and they will be on the truck routes, especially going from Asia into the U.S. And then next year, of course, we have additional aircraft 76s and some more Dash 8s and, again, our timing couldn't have been any better. So it's going to fit right into the needs of our customers. Okay?", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to online question. This question comes in. Can you please tell us how the news of the pension changes that you've announced will affect your go-forward long-term basis and how it changes your view of retirement benefits?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sir, and I'll take that. This is Richard. I think the first thing that I want to say is that we spent a lot of time, actually several years, evaluating different options to look at how do we manage the liability, remain competitive in the market from a benefit standpoint, and as we announced just over a month ago, we're moving to a pay-as-you-go 401k plan effective January of 2023. It will change our risk profile. It will allow us to have more predictable and sustainable costs. It does reduce our future liabilities on the current balance sheet. And we'll also lower our exposure to the discount rates. As discount rates change, we see both expense change on pension as well as the liability side, as well as the change that PBGC has made with increasing costs that we're having to put into the plan, but it doesn't go to the employees.", "For 2017, there is no change to the guidance because we have spent a few years on this and we knew we were making this announcement in June. There is no additional discretionary contributions to pension, and the reason there isn't is because we made them in the first quarter, as I talked about on the last call. That was because of the PBGC premiums and taking advantage. Now, upon announcement, we did have to remeasure the liabilities, and what we saw was discount rates were down about 32 basis points from the end of the year to the end of June. At the same time, because the equity markets have been stronger, we did see some offset from the higher return.", "Finally, when I put all of this together, it's really hard to talk about what it's going to do in future years because until you know what discount rates are doing, you don't really have an impact on your financials five years out. But what I can tell you is we spent a lot of time trying to balance what is right for our employees \u2013 most of them spend their careers at UPS, as well as managing the risk profile and the liabilities for UPS as a whole. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So, as you mentioned, since November of last year, the company has announced a lot of facility expansions totaling over $1.5 billion in the U.S., additions and expansions rather. So if you could just give us a sense what the total investment required for the hub modernization program is? And how that fits into the context of your Capital Expenditure run rate this year and perhaps into next year?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So, actually, a lot of these buildings are over multiple periods. And what we talked about in the investor conference is over the next three to five years, there would be somewhere around \u2013 between 28 million square feet that and 35 million square feet that would go in over the three to five-year period. And then talk David had this morning, he talked about we've announced almost 4.5 million square feet in 2017. Over the last year and a half, we've actually announced about 7.5 million square feet that's currently under construction, and just about 5.5 million square feet will open in 2018.", "Overall, it is in the guidance of the increase to 6% to 7% per CapEx of revenue, and that's really because you saw now for the last four quarters in the U.S., we've been having close to 5% or greater revenue growth. We need these buildings in order to continue to grow. These growth rates are higher than our historical average and we talked in the investor conference about the importance of growth and, at the same time, with our high return on invested capital, these assets will continue to allow us to nurture not only the ROIC, but also grow the top line and bottom line. So we're on a path for the next three to five years. It's something we laid out at the investor conference and we are looking forward to that 5.5 million square feet opening next year.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. So, Richard, wanted to just ask you on currency, how come no change in the currency headwinds just given the recent move in the dollar? And then, if there is no impact or no change this year, maybe, I know it is early, but can you give a preliminary view on what kind of potential tailwind we could see from currency next year? Thank you.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. So actually, just to step back for a moment, in 2017, we went to a \u2013 we were, historically, before 2017, used a collar approach and it was a stock market transaction. What we did in 2017 is to do a transition because starting in 2018 we'll go to a dollar cost averaging where we're spreading it over a 36-month period. What that means is the year-over-year comparisons won't have big variations. But what it means for 2017 is that we do have a collar. The increase over the last, probably few weeks, where the dollar has lost between 6% and 8% of the value is inside the collar. So for the hedge currencies, what that means is it's going to be right where we expected it to be, and for the unhedged, you'll have a slight difference in the overall.", "Now, if you recall, we called out during the first quarter, we had about $119 million drag from currency. This quarter, $114 million. Until the quarter closes, and each month closes, I won't know what the drag is and how much it changes because the most recent changes will impact July, and then whatever happens is going into August and September. But because we give you that new schedule in our web schedules, that will allow you to see. And as it comes down, we'll obviously communicate that, but right now, we're sitting at about $117 million this morning. And that's right in the collar range that we had already set out. But with the new program, the most important part is we won't see this year after year starting in 2018. And it's also important to remember when you look at the International business, we have an 18.4% margin even with the drag from currency, so we continue to have industry-leading margins because all the work Jim and his team is doing in growing the business and growing exports.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "So just so I'm clear, don't count on a currency tailwind next year?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "That's correct. And when we evolve to this new weighted average, we actually had explained that by doing that we would remove \u2013 that because what happens is for basically two-thirds of the comparison period, it's the same currency year-over-year. It's only the head and the tail that will be different from the timing standpoint.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Kevin Sterling, Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Sterling - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. I noticed there's been a lot of talk about the International Air export market, but maybe I could drill down a little bit in your Next Day Air growth. That was very nice at 6.4%, and we've not seen that type of growth for the past couple of years in Next Day Air because I can remember seeing the shift past couple of years from premium products to Deferred products. But now it appears that Next Day Air is back in vogue. Why is this? Is it the Amazon effect, with supply chains just speeding up and everybody looking to catch up? And do you think we will continue to see is this growth in Next Day Air?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yes. So, this is Alan. I'll take that. Yes, so as you know, we saw premium Next Day Air revenue grew at over 7% and Deferred grew at about 13.5%. There's a couple of things going on there. First, our customers are really responding and enjoying our continual expansion of the Next Day Air and Next Day Air's early service to more postal codes to anybody else out there in the market. And so our market leadership in Express and premium Next Day Air supports our healthcare, high-tech, and professional services segment customers, and strategies.", "In fact, now, and for the last few quarters, UPS is the air market volume leader.", "On the other hand, the Next Day Saver, the UPS Ground, Deferred Air are focused to support our e-commerce and retail customers, and so when you look at our air products and how we have them positioned, along with the integrated portfolio with the ground, we have the industry segments that need that premium service identified and we are making some real gains there. And then we're also addressing the opportunity for the Next Day and Deferred Air opportunities for the e-commerce type of customers. So thanks for the question.", "Kevin Sterling - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take an online question. This comes from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Can you talk about how Marken has evolved within UPS? How do you see the opportunity to grow supply chain and fulfillment with the growth of e-commerce and omni-channel?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yes. This is Alan. I'll take the first part on Marken and this really kind of falls back in with the last question in terms of the premium air service, because Marken is the premium service when it comes to being able to handle clinical trials. If you folks remember back in February at the last investor conference, we discussed healthcare being one of the three growth verticals that we're targeting and it represents about $70 billion in global opportunity. And certainly, the acquisition of Marken plays right into that. They're the market leader in clinical trials and we couldn't be happier.", "They are enabling our healthcare vertical to immediately deepen and expand our global clinical trials logistics footprint. They're retaining independent operating status. We're seeing excellent growth in connectivity already. UPS and Marken together now are the only clinical trial logistics provider with the hybrid model that's leveraging UPS's world-class Express services and the other valuable parts to the UPS network like brokerage along with Marken's outstanding high service network. We see significant opportunities with cross-selling. Also some bridging over to the commercial side with hospital, labs, and CRO opportunities. So it's really working. And I'll pass it over to Jim for the second part of the question on distribution.", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. So on the distribution piece, I'd say, open with, I think we definitely keep \u2013 continue to lean into healthcare distribution. Certainly, it still is our largest segment now. Continuing in distribution, we are up to 78 facilities across the globe. We opened two new facilities in the previous quarter. So certainly that continues to be a very targeted vertical for us. Marken continues to align to that. Certainly there is a piece of their business that is inside the box as we say, but it also aligns very nicely to our emerging market strategies. It moves across the world. And the clinical trials model synergizes with many of the initiatives that we have. And of course, we also brought on some key leadership in Wes and his team. So, we like the Marken acquisition inside UPS as well as distribution.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes. Thanks so much for taking my question. Appreciate it. So, I had a quick one just on how changes in lease accounting rules will impact the P&L and then on the CapEx just a follow-up, the current increase in investment, just trying to understand what that assumes for growth in B2C volumes. I'm not sure if you look at it this way, but just given e-commerce growth is accelerating and really accelerating off a higher base, the key question for me is, whether you think the current run rate of investment is appropriately sized for that growth or just how you think about the relationship between the two. Thanks very much.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. So, I'll start with the lease accounting and tell you that we are in the process, it's a 2019 implementation of preparing all of the leases that will have to be put on to the balance sheet according to the new accounting standard. Step back for a moment though and those kind of leases for UPS, while they'll be large because we are a large company, aren't large categories. For example, we're an integrator that owns our aircraft and we own an aircraft within our company. So when you see deposits, for example, we put those into the CapEx early because that's \u2013 we are putting in the deposits before we take ownership. There are other companies around the world that don't always own their planes or they're off balance sheet so they have a different preparation than we would have.", "That being said, it's a tremendous effort that we are going through and at the appropriate time when it's all put together, but like I said, we have more than a year-and-a-half till we get there. In terms of the capital, if you go back to our investor conference presentations, we did talk about the growth rate and as I mentioned, the last four quarters in the U.S. have grown almost 5% or more, which is above our historical norm on revenue.", "And you'll see that we continue to believe that what we're doing from an investment side is helping to support a flexible network ability to do more capacity and it's all part of the smart logistics network that we're creating and so we feel very comfortable with the 7.5 million square feet that we have under construction and the announcement that somewhere between 28 million and 35 million square feet will be completed, that we're building this really for the tremendous opportunity of e-commerce and how that's moving, shopping, from physical stores to online.", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Allison Landry, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hi. Thanks for getting my question in. I guess sort of piggybacking on the last question, you've obviously talked about what you're currently seeing in B2B in relation to the brick-and-mortar closures, but if you really think longer-term about this trend and there's expectations out there for at least another 25% of retail locations to close over the next decade or possibly sooner. So, I wanted to ask how much of your B2B business is still replenishment? What do you think the impacts will be on your network as this trend accelerates and whether it might necessitate any incremental capital spending over the next few years? Thanks.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. So we are the B2B market leader in the U.S. and our B2B customer base is spread across many, many industries. The industrial manufacturing, automotive, healthcare, high-tech, professional services and then also retail. Now the \u2013 now while retail stores closing is also a drag, we're also seeing with some of our more successful retailers ship to store where they're blending through an Omnichannel way their B2B and their B2C and encouraging their customers in fact, incenting them to pick their goods up in the stores which is driving actually more small package to those particular stores than in the past as compared to other shipments like truckload and LTL. And with that I'll pass the second part of the question over to Rich.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. So, if you \u2013 Allison, if you think about some of the things we laid out at the investor conference around the faster growth but also the solutions, things like that network planning tool, is really about the ability to adjust because one of the challenges in this online environment is understanding distribution patterns because they're not based on historical. Some years you have heavier buyers in one part of the country than another. So the network planning tool allows us to make the adjustments in real time. You think about what we're doing with Orion and the automation in the buildings, but when you look across the entire portfolio of CapEx, we're really building a network that's going to allow us to grow in a substantial way over the next three years to five years.", "And then on top of that, between synthetic density, Access Points, My Choice, all of those are about helping the transaction to be completed for the end user in a way that's convenient and gives them some choice in how they receive their package. So we feel like we've laid out a good roadmap. We feel like we're taking into account the structural shift from physical stores and we're going through the process, as I said, a moment ago, and building those buildings that we need to make this all work as online continues to grow faster. We're going to take...", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Take it.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sorry, Allison.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "No, go ahead.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take an online question real quick. It's going from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. How has the initial roll out of Saturday delivery been received by shippers and UPS drivers?", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Good morning. This is Myron. While we're early in our deployment, the response from our customers had been very positive. As you will recall, our Saturday operations are both pickup and delivery, which has helped to speed up time in transit and is giving our customers a great opportunity to have Saturday pickups that are delivered on Monday and has proven to be a tremendous market advantage. We deployed over 35 major metros in the quarter on the way to implementing over 4,700 cities in 2017. So, results are positive. The implementations have gone well and our employees are responding very well to this offering.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Aegis Capital. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Kaufman - Aegis Capital Corp.", "Thank you very much. Hi, guys. Lot of my questions have been answered at this point, so let me ask more of a detailed one. You're on track to spend almost $2 billion in share repurchase this year, yet shares outstanding haven't really moved in the last six months. Should I think of $1.8 billion to $2 billion as just an anti-dilutive share repurchase level required? Or is there something else going on that's inflating the share count, so that's why I'm not optically seeing shares decline?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah, so Jeff, this is Richard. And, very specifically, shares do decline. You have different periods when you're increasing your shares for their compensation plans versus the even buying back. But there is a decline this year in shares of 4 million to 5 million shares. And remember, it's an average that you use in your calculations, not where you are at the spot when it occurs.", "Jeffrey Kaufman - Aegis Capital Corp.", "Okay. Very good. That's my question. Thank you.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Childress for any finishing remarks.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We want to thank everyone for joining us today and submitting online questions. We really appreciate it. And I'll turn the call over to David for closing comments.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Well, as you can see, we are moving fast, we're transforming our business, and we're pleased with our progress. We had balanced performance across all segments this quarter, positive operating leverage in the U.S. We remain focused on the efficiency and the pricing initiatives we discussed today. We see strong growth opportunities for UPS and we continue to invest in the next generation UPS smart global logistics network and to implement our strategic initiatives.", "Thank you for joining us on the call today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.", "And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Good morning, and welcome to the UPS Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.

Also joining us today is Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectation for the future performance or results of operations of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K and 2017 10-Qs.

Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.", "Now, I will turn the call over to David.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, Scott; and good morning, everyone. Again this quarter, we are reporting solid UPS results with revenue gains and good execution in our segments. Our performance is driven by UPS's high-value solutions, broad portfolio of services, efficient global network, and strategic investments.", "Let me first take a moment to recognize the difficult conditions created by several recent natural disasters and the incredible way our team responded to these challenges. Some of the communities we serve have been severely impacted and we've been focused on restoring service to those areas. I want to express my personal appreciation to thousands of UPSers around the world for their dedication, working side-by-side in their communities and on their routes delivering life-sustaining supplies.", "In addition, the UPS Foundation committed more than $3 million to support the relief efforts throughout the U.S., Caribbean and Mexico. I can't emphasize enough how proud we are of the UPS team and their great work. It's this kind of teamwork that gives me confidence that we're well prepared to carry momentum forward to deliver a successful peak season.", "Kate Gutmann will provide details on peak at the conclusion of my comments.", "Now, let's take a look at the company's performance. During the quarter our focused execution, combined with our ability to capitalize on market opportunities, enabled UPS to meet our financial expectations. Our e-commerce and cross-border solutions help UPS deliver strong revenue growth of 7% on a 4.6% increase in daily shipments. In the U.S. increasing demand for UPS Next Day Air and Ground products drove revenue growth. Focus on fundamentals, combined with the benefits of recent investments, produce good results, especially when you consider the unexpected headwinds we faced.", "The International segment continues to serve as a growth engine for the business; producing record third quarter operating profits. Several actions taken this quarter were designed to accelerate that growth in the future. In Europe, UPS's enhanced network capabilities enabled market share gains, clearly about 20% growth in intra-Europe exports shipments is evidence of that success.", "In Asia, our joint venture with SF Express was approved. We're moving forward with plans to develop a cobranded, highly-competitive export product for Chinese businesses shipping to the U.S., positioning us for more growth in the small and medium-size customer base. We will expand this offering to other markets in the future to ensure UPS has enough international air capacity to meet growing needs, we took delivery this month of two 747-8 aircraft with another on the way this year. We're quickly putting them into high-demand transpacific routes in time for peak season.", "Another encouraging development this quarter was the early initiation of contract talks. We've worked with the Teamsters for more than 80 years with the objective of providing industry-leading service to our customers, so we can create new jobs and reward employees for contributing to the company's success. We expect the negotiations to move forward in a constructive manner and we know that when employees are engaged, connected and committed to the company's priorities, UPS customers, share owners and employees all will benefit.", "As we move into the fourth quarter, the macroeconomic environment looks solid. In the U.S. in the third quarter, we saw a slight reduction in economic growth forecast. As a result, industrial production slowed in the third quarter, but forecast for the coming months have a more optimistic outlook that should bode well for B2B demand. We also remain confident about the holiday season, as consumer sentiment remains elevated, although there is some inflationary pressure on wages due to high employment levels.", "Looking outside the U.S., global growth projections have moved higher as performance in Europe and China continues to exceed expectations. While the economic outlook remains fairly promising, we see further upside potential from U.S. tax reform, which we strongly support. The current proposal will provide great incentives for companies to both reinvest and create jobs at home.", "Against this backdrop, we are well prepared to capitalize on growth opportunities and serve UPS customers' needs as we head into our peak season.", "And to give you an update on the preparations, planning and expectations for peak, I'll turn things over to Kate. Kate?", "Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to review our strategies for the 2017 peak season. Our peak strategies are designed to efficiently and reliably serve all UPS customers, whether those who experienced the highest seasonal spikes in demand, to small and medium-size customers, as well as our B2B customers like those in healthcare. The UPS team has worked throughout the year to prepare for the e-commerce growth we anticipate this year. In fact, between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve, we expect to complete a record 750 million deliveries worldwide, about 40 million more than last year.", "In the U.S., the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales to increase between 3.6% and 4%. They also expect non-store retail, or online sales, to be higher this year, up between 11% and 15%.", "At UPS, we're focused on delivering a successful peak season for customers and investors through more collaboration, more capacity, better control, and a strong commitment to service. First, we're focused on improved collaboration with customers for better forecasts, so we can collectively smooth work across the network. We are helping customers optimize the experience they provide their customers, from the first click to the final delivery. More extensive collaboration this year will better align UPS solutions and capacity with seasonal promotions and fulfillment strategies. We work closely to obtain daily shipping estimates by location and even by product. We've built operating and communication plans that allow us to respond to changes quickly.", "A second area of focus this year is expanding capacity. UPS customers will benefit from several facility expansions and the technology investments that we've made throughout the year. We've increased UPS delivery capacity through a combination of permanent and temporary facility expansion.", "Across the U.S. network, we've increased both package delivery and sorting capacity by about 6% over the past year. This represents the addition of more than 1 million square feet of added permanent and automated capacity available for peak. The permanent facilities are located across the country in key locations like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Kansas City. The deployment of Saturday operations with both pickup and delivery provides us with new and more efficient capabilities to serve customer growth. We will also take advantage of the flexible solutions from our partners at Coyote Logistics again this year.", "The third focus area is control, both control of deliveries for UPS customers and control of the UPS network. UPS My Choice will provide greater control to more than 40 million global members, an increase of 10 million from last year. Through My Choice, more than one in four U.S. households communicate directly with UPS to enhance their delivery experience. The combination of My Choice and UPS Access Point creates a highly-efficient solution that provides customers with the assurance of on-time delivery and higher first-attempt delivery completion.", "To enhance customer support and our network decision-making, we will again operate control towers in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and this year we've added this process in Asia as well. As unplanned customers' needs arise, the control towers will make a timely assessment of available network capacity and ensure we are properly compensated. Revenue management is an ongoing exercise at UPS as demonstrated by our 2018 general rate increase of approximately 4.9%, which was announced yesterday.", "In addition, we've introduced our first peak-season surcharge and customer acceptance is progressing as planned. These surcharges target specific residential, heavy volume periods and large items that require special handling. This strategy is designed to encourage smoothing of volume across the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and ensures we are appropriately compensated for the value provided to customers.", "The final area of focus for UPS is commitment. The entire UPS team will work diligently to provide world-class value and service during this upcoming holiday season. Global markets are evolving and customer demands are ever-increasing, so developing optimal, peak-season plans is a dynamic process each year. We take future expectations and learnings from previous peak seasons and apply them to continually improve the company's service levels and financial results during this critical time of year.", "Our plans are comprehensive, our networks and employees are prepared, and we are ready to deliver.", "Thank you for your time today. Now, I'll turn it over to Richard.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, Kate. UPS had another successful quarter. Our results highlight the flexibility of the global UPS business model and the power of our investments. We've managed through headwinds in the U.S., delivered broad-based strong growth in the International business, and continued generating excellent results in the Supply Chain and Freight group. The UPS team's execution this quarter generated earnings of $1.45 per share, driven by sustained revenue expansion in all segments.", "Looking closer at the business segment, in the U.S., revenue and costs were negatively impacted by natural disasters in Texas, Florida, and California, creating a drag of about $50 million of operating profit. However, growth in package volume was positive, up 3.4%, with revenue up nearly 4%. We've had strong growth in our business going back to mid-2016. Higher growth in both Next Day Air and Ground products was driven by e-commerce demand as average daily shipments increased 8% for Next Day Air, while Ground was up 3.4%. Package yields improved 2% year-over-year, and base rates came in at the higher end of our 2%-to-3% range.", "Fuel surcharges added to the yields by approximately 40 basis points. Fuel and base rate improvements completely offset a drag from customer and product mix this quarter. The U.S. operating profit came in at $1.2 billion. After adjusting for the unplanned events, our profits were in line with our expectations.", "Results this quarter include one-less operating day, about $40 million of costs from our previously-discussed ongoing investments in new buildings, and the deployment of Saturday operations.", "Now, let's turn to the International segment. It was another great quarter. The third quarter reported profits were up almost 9%. And on a currency-neutral basis, operating profit was up 20%, making this the 11th straight quarter of double-digit growth.", "The largest operating profit gains were in Asia and Europe. Revenue increased more than 11% in the third quarter. Growth was evenly balanced across the world between premium and deferred products, both increasing at double-digit pace.", "Export shipments jumped nearly 20%, led by robust cross-border shipping. Growth was higher in all regions on all major products, driven by expanded portfolio of services and market-focused strategies. The story was similar for the domestic shipments in International; growth was broad, up about 6% with year-over-year gains in all key countries we serve.", "Currency-neutral international package yields were up 2.3% as base rate improvements and fuel offset trade lane and product mix. Our global investments are allowing us to grow faster than the market by expanding capabilities across the regions. We are adding aircraft to support our export products, and we're about halfway through the five-year, $2-billion investment in the European network. Our international strategies produced another successful quarter driven by strong volume growth and expanding yields, moving on our optimized integrated network.", "Now, turning to the Supply Chain and Freight group, which produced another great quarter of growth in revenue and operating profit. Revenue increased 13% with gains in all the major business units. Forwarding, Coyote, and UPS Freight had the highest growth in the quarter, and they were assisted by the concentration of our middle-market customer wins.", "In the Forwarding group, revenue growth in the International and North American Air Freight markets were elevated by high-single-digit tonnage gains. UPS Freight increased revenue 11% on LTL tonnage growth of nearly 6%, combined with a 3.6% improvement in LTL per hundredweight pricing.", "In the Distribution unit, revenue management and efficiency fueled double-digit operating profit expansion, driven by the aerospace and retail sectors. Operating profit in this segment increased $20 million, or 10% over last year, making this the best third quarter ever and one of the most profitable quarters in our history.", "Now, looking at the balance sheet; through the first nine months of 2017, UPS generated $4.4 billion in cash from operations, paid $2.1 billion in dividends, and repurchased more than 12 million shares for about $1.4 billion.", "On a year-to-date basis, the company has made capital expenses of $3.7 billion as we transform our network for tremendous growth opportunity, more efficiency, and long-term value. Our investment strategies will help ensure we achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in cost savings and avoidance that we have laid out earlier this year.", "Now, I'll turn to guidance; let me start by level-setting; the year-over-year comparisons in the fourth quarter. First, we received about $40 million of benefits from discrete tax events in the fourth quarter of 2016, benefiting last year's adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 by about $0.05.", "Next, we have a potential currency drag in the fourth quarter of 2017 of around $100 million, or about $0.07 adjusted earnings per share. The final currency affect will depend on what the rates do in the coming months.", "Turning to the business, we have performed well through September as global e-commerce strategies are evolving with increased seasonality. We expect this to continue moving forward.", "In the U.S. segment, recent economic news is encouraging. Consumer, retail, and business conditions hold promise, but we also see some caution as the effects from the natural disasters linger into the fourth quarter. Additionally, we are seeing some cost pressures on temporary peak hiring and purchase transportation in specific markets and locations in the U.S. And lastly, we predict continued strong volume and revenue growth for the remainder of the year.", "Turning to the International segment; we expect positive momentum as we move forward, allowing market share gains to continue, yet at the same time currency will remain a headwind. And in the Supply Chain and Freight segment, we're well-positioned to take advantage of firming rate conditions and support peak season small package strategies. We anticipate this segments growth trends will continue.", "At the total company level, revenue growth is expected to be at the high end of our full year guidance of 5% to 7%. We now anticipate fourth quarter taxes should remain around 35%.", "Considering our current momentum and reviewing all the economic data and our internal initiatives, we are confident that we're moving higher in our full-year guidance range. We now anticipate 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.10, which includes currency transition of approximately $0.30 per share, or $400 million.", "Before I open the line, let me summarize. UPS is focused on making the necessary adjustments to adapt to current conditions as we implement our long-term strategies. As Kate mentioned, UPS is bringing new capabilities into this year's peak season. Saturday operations, new surcharges, and more efficient capacity. These initiatives position us for success.", "As we look ahead, these investments we are making today will serve as a springboard to deliver new solutions and long-term value for years to come.", "Before I turn it over to the operator, I want to remind you that the webcast users can submit live questions during today's call.", "Thank you for taking the time this morning, and now I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "I will now turn the program back over to our Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Scott Childress, please go ahead.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thank you very much. Our first question, we're going to take an online question from Dave Ross of Stifel Nicolaus. David's question is, now that the SF Express joint venture has received regulatory approval, what are the next steps? What is the expected impact, if any, on the business from the JV in 2018?", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. This is David and I'll take the first part of that question then I'll pass it over to Jim. We were excited that we did get approval and approval on a timely basis. The reason that's so important to us is there's just so many opportunities between China and the U.S.", "And this joint venture just combines SF Express' deep China presents with our UPS integrated global networks that we just see as a very good combination. That being said, Jim, why don't you give a little more detail?", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. I'd be glad to. So David, I think on the back of David's comments, we've been working on this for well over a year by the way. I would tell you, it's very significant in our mind as a big step for us inside and crossing borders in and out of China. Really what it does for us is it gets us and gives us the ability to go to new places, to reach new customer segments with new products that we haven't had in this market, obviously, for 110 years at UPS. It's going to synergize with our Forwarding business, and it's going to really continue to let us grow in cross-border trade.", "Just a data point for you that I get very excited with is in the network that SF and their team has, are 173,000 touch-points in China that are made up of couriers and service centers in retail stores that will be able to actually participate very differently going forward than we have in the past. And I think the other thing lastly, because, obviously, the specifics of what's going to happen in 2018 and beyond will become more apparent as we move. I would say that we planned them to be material, obviously. But the team at SF, as well, I think partners very nicely with our team in Asia, and I think we can't undersell that partnership concept as well. So appreciate the question.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take another online question. This question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclay Capital (sic) [Barclays Capital. Fourth quarter results have been volatile in the past year, with both service and cost challenges impacting profitability for UPS. With another strong peak season expected, can management discuss how the additional resources and costs added this quarter can be better scaled to actual volume demands, while still meeting service commitments?", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. Brandon, thank you for that question. And we're going to spend a little time on that because it's got just a few different angles. So I'll say a few words and then going to hear from Myron and Jim from their business units, and then Kate from a customer and revenue perspective. But I believe we're well-positioned to have a successful peak season, both from a customer standpoint and an investor standpoint. And it's coming quickly. We've been working a long time on this, and I think there's a lot of confidence throughout the group.", "So that being said, why don't go ahead with you, Myron.", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Good morning. There are several factors that give us confidence in our ability to perform this peak season. Considering the tremendous amount of time that's been spent with our customers to develop accurate forecasts, preparing to hire and train seasonal staff, as well as expanding our permanent and seasonal capacity, we believe that Saturday deployments of our operations will have a tremendous impact on this peak. It'll give us five additional delivery days. We're planning to process 40% more volume on Saturdays, and 80% of the volume we plan to deliver over the weekends will be through the facilities where we've already established Saturday operations.", "Once again, we plan to hire 95,000 seasonal helpers, in which 35% over the last three years have later been hired into permanent jobs with UPS. The onboarding process will be significantly improved through new technology advancements. It will also help increase productivity through our mobile delivery apps, as well as our abilities to give dynamic sort instructions through Wi-Fi capabilities. We have also added an additional 1 million square feet under roof that will allow us to have additional sort capacities, and we've implemented 10 additional peak hubs, so we feel like we are positioned for success.", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "This is Jim. I'm going to add a couple of points that I think are material in nature outside the U.S. I'll start in Europe and then I'll go quickly to Asia. Europe, quite frankly, has been one of those years that we've had kind of peak volumes all year long, which is one of the advantages to going into this peak season. Our growth in Europe all year long has approached double digits every quarter, so we've had to add, obviously, both human and capital investment to support that. We've opened three new hubs this year, 170,000 pieces an hour in Europe.", "Obviously, we've had the unfortunate situation of the cyber-attack in the middle of the year that pushed volume into our network that we needed to respond to. We've added Lyft in Cologne, so the Europe infrastructure as we move into this fourth quarter, I feel like is in a very unique and positive position.", "And then we go out to Asia. Obviously, we've talked about the arrival of the 747-8s. The first one we took on the ground in Hong Kong on October 18. The next one is October 28. We get another one on November 24th, and then we move into next year. So they also have had a year of very high demand out of Asia that we've had to scale the network. And so in both cases, as a kind of front end of the engine, I think we're in great shape honestly for a great peak season to connect back, obviously, with Myron's network as well in the U.S.", "Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "From a customer perspective, I would add that as I mentioned in the opening, collaboration is critical, deep and broad, and the UPS team is now considered trusted advisors to our customers. We've gone through an extensive forecasting process. And also enhanced by some of the learnings from last year, we do this now by location, by product, and we've gone further within our customers' organizations, so that we encompass merchandising, marketing, fulfillment, as well as transportation. All of that leads to mutual success.", "We've jointly agreed upon special operating plans to help smooth out some of the peak periods, such as the Monday spikes that would be leveled off by operations opening on Cyber Weekend, as well as Super Weekend, and the customers are absolutely participating in that. Better utilizing for the first time Saturday delivery and Saturday pickup, which is market-leading and has been embraced by our customers.", "And then, of course, the control tower, which we continue to enhance over the years, finding ways to say, yes, more often to un-forecasted needs, and aligning it with the availability in our network.", "And along those lines, we've continued to reinforce that it's important to align the price with cost of delivering this value and customers are working to ship volume in two weeks to minimize the impact of the surcharge. But if needed in those weeks, the surcharge applies to those packages. So a joint effort and, again, one that we're confident and will lead to success at peak season.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee, Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, great. Thanks, and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about some of the cost headwinds that we've seen in the Domestic segment. It looks like you're pulling forward maybe some costs into the fourth quarter with $60 million, which is up from the third quarter's performance. I guess I just wanted to get a sense how we should be thinking about maybe beyond fourth quarter. It sounds like you're ramping up for peak season, but as we start to move into 2018, how should that cadence to sort of these cost headwinds as you roll out Saturday and build up the Domestic network look?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. Chris, this is Richard. And I think, first, it's a little early to guide, because we are just putting all of our plans together for 2018. What we did earlier this year, say, this $100 million to $200 million operating penalty would be ongoing for the next three years as we continue to not only open the Saturday operations. And the reason the fourth quarter is large is because that's when you have most of the operations open.", "But it's also, as we operate new buildings and start construction or operating new buildings, there's some penalties as we get these buildings up to the same standard from when they first start to the UPS full implementation, because it's a step function. So again, on the next call, we'll talk about 2018, but we did call out that there would be between $100 million and $200 million for each of the next few years.", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "When you look beyond this peak season, Brandon (sic) [Chris], take into consideration that we'll be continuing to implement Saturday operations next year. At the onset of peak this year, we will have deployed Saturday operations in over 200 locations. We would expect that to be a bit greater than 90 locations for next year, as well as the additional capacity that we will add for next year. We're going to bring on 5 million additional square feet that will bring into the network next year, so it'll be the onboarding of those locations and the additional head count associated with it.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. So it looks like the underlying sort of growth is accelerating here as International supply chain are happening, but I want to kind of get some feedback from you guys on the direction of the Domestic margin as you think over the next two or three years. You've got the implementation costs kind of in the base over the next couple of years. Should we be expecting that the operating profit in Domestic is going to be growing kind of with the top-line from here? Or do you think there is still some possibility that 2017 \u2013 or 2018 could be a little bit lower on the Domestic margin side?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. Again, it's a little early, because we are just putting these plans together, David. This is Richard, obviously. But I think the first thing you should think about is that next year with 5.5 million square feet of buildings opening, it will be muted as well next year, but it really is part of a deliberate plan. One of the things is we've been looking at buildings and trying to do this as fast as we can. And we've said all along we were balancing the opening of the buildings with the disruption to the network. And so we have seen that putting about a million square feet in this year and next year it's 5 million square feet. So the velocity is a little different than we originally planned.", "But at the same time, as we get our plans finalized we'll share that, but I would expect that it would be a little bit muted on the lower end of where we guided for next year. But we're still putting plans together, so it's a little early for me to say exactly where we're going to land.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah. No, I'm not looking for like an exact number, I'm just trying to think like, I think what's keeping a lot of folks nervous about the stock, quite frankly is, is either a lack of commitment, or a feeling that there is a lack of controllability about where that Domestic margin is going to go over the next kind of 2, 3 years. Year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter is not the issue. The issue really is, is the management team feel like they can get a flat to up Domestic margin? And what are the incentives around that to make sure that actually happens?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So I think the first thing is we're looking at this much longer term. I mean we're investing in order to build out our network, not just for the next year or two but really for the next generation. And that plays into it, and if we can move a little faster, it's always going to be the best thing we can do, because our highest return is going to be, of course, reinvesting in the business.", "And not all growth is going to be linear because, look at our revenue line right now, we're having some of the fastest revenue growth that we've had in over five years. And we think that that's healthy and we'll continue to adjust the network for that kind of growth because we historically have not had that kind of growth.", "So I would tell you that you should be thinking about we're preparing this for the future, we're looking at the return on invested capital, and all of our goals are aligned with making sure that we continue to increase value and bring the proper return, not only for UPS, but for our investors going forward.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "All right. Thanks for the additional color.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take an online question from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer & Company. Can you please address the drivers of the recent improvement in global air freight markets and global trade? How is UPS positioning strategically to capitalize on this momentum?", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. This is David, I'll start that and then hand it to Jim. But we are encouraged by the recent improvements in global trade and we think that the global economy certainly has a part with that. But exports are growing pretty much throughout the world, and this is just an important part of our growth strategy. We see Jim's International unit as really a primary growth engine and this is feeding a lot of that growth engine. Jim?", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yes, Scott, I would add three points to what David has said. First, obviously, inventory levels continue to be at levels that are going to push more through that supply chain both, and I'm talking kind of air freight and ocean in this discussion.", "In the most recent quarter, the data that we see has the ocean utilization at over 97%. So you have a high, high, demand environment now with capacity really becoming tight. Obviously, that's driving the rates up and you can see that across the industry and across, obviously, the players.", "And then you get up in the air, this is the fourth consecutive quarter where you really had demand outpacing capacity. Obviously, it started with pilots coming out of the air in China, capacity came with it, the air freight rates have tightened, obviously, we all have to manage through that, and then manage the connections.", "But then in the middle, the third event, obviously, is weather. When all of those three combinations hit you get an air freight and an ocean market that exists as it is today, obviously it will drive transportation rates up, and we have to respond to that. And I think actually the UPS team beginning in Asia moving back out to the west has done a great job. So we look forward to our fourth quarter as well. Appreciate the question.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah, good morning. So I'll maybe stick with that topic of international strength and it's pretty impressive the acceleration in export volume growth. I was wondering if you could give us a little more perspective on some of the pieces of that. I know obviously, you don't talk about market, but how much of that is kind of benefit from TNT cyber-attack that volumes come over? In the future, maybe, how much do you think we ought to consider the SF Express stepping things up?", "Just trying to get a sense of kind of what might be temporary and what might be you ought to put into the model a double-digit export volume growth for the next couple of quarters or couple of years?", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay, Tom. That's a broad question. I'll do my best to skinny it down. First of all, let me start with \u2013 I think Rich had some opening comments as did David. I think that the way we think about this is, this is just another step that our customers are choosing UPS. We've had 11 quarters in a row of continued momentum. This one, obviously, when you see 19% export volume growth, that is certainly a big one.", "You pointed to Europe but if you take a look at Europe back in 2016 when we started this, the growth has been accelerating for almost two years now. The intra-European growth started in early 2016 at 6% and then the quarters went up from there. They went to 8%, 11%, 15%, 12%, now 19%. So this has been a very deliberate investment in that market with all of the dynamics that were going on. We started in early 2016.", "Yes. There is some additional lift in the most recent quarter from the malware event; no question about that. But this growth is more than just Europe, this is a broad-based growth. Richard touched on it as well. We're really growing across the globe. I can't tell you what to put in your models, but certainly from my perspective this is about many years into the future, not just the next quarter. So we're pretty pleased with where we are and we look to the future and tomorrow to keep it going.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Were the numbers you mentioned just the total International export, or those were Europe numbers, you mentioned before?", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Those were intra-European export numbers.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Overall, exports grew in all regions. And, actually, it was pretty much aligned to both with the number we had for intra-Europe for all exports. And, Tom, we recognize that there probably was a little extra in this quarter, but to Jim's point we've been on a two-year improvement and we still expect that. Obviously, it doesn't mean that we'll stay at these current levels, because of what happened in the third quarter elsewhere, but we do expect to continue to grow strongly and we've guided that International is an important part of the growth story, and it's something Jim and his team have done a really good job doing in the last few years.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "And just to expand on Richard's comments about the two-year story, this has really been about a 10-year story, and then we committed to the $2 billion a couple of years ago and we're probably 40% of the way through that. But we've had big, big success in Europe and in our International exports for the last 10 years, so it's just been a very consistent story. All right?", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thank you for the time.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, Tom. We're going to take another online question. This question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan.", "How has the first 747-8s performed in the early testing, which customers are utilizing the domestic air service most frequently? And can the service become more cost effective when cascading the international fleet to the domestic routes?", "James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "This is Jim, again. As I mentioned, the kind of rollout plan of the 747s, the 10/18 was the first one, and then the next one is coming in the next few weeks, which is great timing for us.", "With respect to how are they performing, obviously, as you would know that any time you do get new aircraft you got to make sure that they perform properly, the airline led by Louisville did a great job to make sure we tested them as quickly as we could when they came off the line. We advanced that knowing the demand and the capacity issues that we had. So to get the first one there on 10/18 was a bit earlier than we had seen when we started.", "The actual first flight that left, those 747-8s can carry 288,000 pounds, and that one carried 288,000 pounds. So it was full to the brim as they say with small package revenue. They couldn't come at any better time, because we've been running, if you look at our block hours, year-over-year increases of almost 5% in our block hours to actually take care of this demand.", "And so for the bigger ones to come that can carry the extra payload in a more effective and efficient way, it is great for every participant in the actual supply chain. The customers love it. Obviously, we do. The economics love it, and the service loves it as well. So I think Myron wants to add a couple of points from an airline perspective and/or Alan does.", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Hey, Brian. This is Alan. Yes, from the domestic perspective to your question about the customers, I would just say that we've been gaining air share each quarter during the last three years, and we'd emerged as the air-share leader. And part of that is our expansion of our 10:30 and noon and Next Day Air early service to more postal codes than any other carrier here in the United States. And we're doing that similarly with our International Express and our International Express Plus services around the globe.", "And that's very, very attractive to our health care and high tech and professional services industry segments. And then on the e-commerce side, we're obviously growing that quite well also with our Next Day Air Saver, as well as our deferred services. And you can see the strong growth that we had in Next Day Air this past quarter at 8%. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "A question from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Just if I could follow-up on those International questions from earlier, could you please elaborate? You call out the revenue growth, 11%, driven by premium products. Could you specify, was that uniquely in any one area? You've talked about broad-based, but curious about the premium products? And then also, nice movement on yield growth in the quarter in International, could you speak about that, particularly export yield growth? Thanks.", "Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Let me start with the yield growth, I guess, is that I appreciate you noticing that because there's a lot of hard work that goes into that. Certainly, we recognized over the last couple of quarters we thought we needed to do a bit better job there to match it. Kate's talked about that in her opening comments. So that yield movement was purposeful and a couple of quarters in the making, and we think it's right for us long-term and the shareholders.", "With respect to the balance, look, I mean, I think the team's doing a great job. It's growth in Mexico. It's growth in Canada. It's growth in Europe. It's growth in Asia. It's growth in our intra-Asia networks. And, obviously, you start to layer in the likes of partnerships of the SF Expresses in the future and the Middle East investments that we've made, we feel like we've got some good momentum that will continue. So I think the key word is balance and, hopefully, you can see that across the talk we're having today and in the continued dialogue we will have in the future.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take an online question. This comes from Kevin Sterling from Seaport Global Securities. Purchase transportation cost as a percentage of revenue has been creeping up over the past two years. Can you talk about your purchase transportation costs jumping as a percentage of revenue during the quarter?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure. And this is Richard, Kevin, and, obviously, I'll take this question. I think the first thing you have to do is think about the last two years. And while purchase transportation cost is up, there are two big buckets of purchase transportation. There's what we do internationally, and Jim just talked about how revenue has grown and we've been on a two-year, really, continued improvement plan that him and his team have been working.", "And then the other side is Supply Chain and Freight. And to give you an example, if you go back and look at our history prior to last year, our revenue growth in the Supply Chain and Freight group has been pretty muted. But yes, last year we grew at 8% and year-to-date we're right now just under 13% growth. Obviously, as Coyote, Freight Forwarding, those all play into the purchase transportation.", "And so, I think when we look at purchase transportation we think it's healthy. This quarter alone, over 60%, between 60% and 65%, was really driven by International and Supply Chain and Freight. And then when you get into what's going on in domestic, there's a piece of it because SurePost is growing a little faster than the average domestic.", "And then there's just a normal increases that you would expect. So when we look at it, I know it's a big number reported change, but if you look at what's going on with the business underlying it, I think you see that that goes right in line. And that's why you've seen both International profit growth and then what the Supply Chain and Freight segment has done and really called out in January that we've continue to see improvement this year. And that's what's happened as well.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. David or Richard, can you talk about the accelerating CapEx? You talked about adding new aircraft and now you are jumping from 1 million square feet to 5 million square feet. Maybe talk about the scale going forward? And did your original CapEx targets account for the switch from upgrading your service at your sort centers to the building of new ones that you now plan?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure Ken, this is Richard. Obviously, we just talked about it, and hopefully everyone in the call is getting that, part of this is about growth, and the emphasis that growth we talked about it in February. I've said on the call we think we're going to beat the higher end of the range for revenue for the total enterprise. And so when you think about year-to-date 7% growth across the entire enterprise, that's better than we've seen in over five years. Really, really coming out of the recession was the only other time we saw this kind of growth number. And it's about growth today and going into the future. So we're building and expanding the network, optimizing the investments, to look for what's best for UPS.", "Very early in the CapEx, we said we would continue to tweak, understanding we couldn't disrupt the network too fast because you still need to provide the right service for our customers, but we wanted to go as fast as we could.", "In the first earnings call in April of this year we did move forward a 747-8 that we actually have in operation today. And then we bought some land over the last year. It's really for buildings going all the way until the next five years, and that's because strategically it was the right place and the right size, and we did not want to lose that land because we knew what are roadmap plans were.", "When you put all that together, we likely think we'll be closer to 8%or around 8% instead of our initial guidance. But given the return on invested capital and when we do put new assets and investments in the business, the return they get, we think it's the best use for not only UPS but for our investors as well.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Richard.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Our next question will come from Dave Ross. And Dave's questions are: Are you more or less positive on 2018 UPS and global economic perspectives than you were during the last call in July?", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "This is David, I'll answer that. From a macroeconomic standpoint I would say that a little bit more positive about 2018. And just a couple of things, we talked about global trade seems to be growing, Europe is holding up well, there is concerns about Brexit, but for now Europe is holding up well. China has kind of been better than expected, and then exports in general are growing.", "And then from the U.S. side you see a couple of things. Obviously, the consumer is still driving the economy and especially from the e-commerce, we think that's just going to continue to grow. Excuse me, there's also optimism about the tax reform and what that can do to stimulate the economy. And we believe that that is getting more and more interest. And the last part was the industrial production was affected a little bit this quarter by the natural disasters. Maybe won't bounce back completely in the fourth quarter, but we certainly think that will continue the first part of next year. So good question. I think we are little more positive. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, good morning, all. Thanks for the question. Just maybe for Alan and Myron on the new peak season holiday surcharge. Interested in what the receptivity from the customers have been. Have we seen any changes in behavior yet? What are the planning discussions like in the context of that new holiday peak season surcharge program?", "How do you expect flows to play out? Do you expect customers to largely avoid that and shift volumes into some the weeks not governed by the surcharges? Do you expect behavior to be unaffected? And maybe in the context of all of that, any sort of incremental risk or concern regarding access to capacity in December, given the looming ELD mandate on the truckload side? Thanks.", "Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Thanks, Ben. This is Kate. I'll actually address the question. We've been working extensively with customers tied to the peak planning. And so to address some of the points in your question, definitely, consumer demand being what it is, some of it can be steered to other weeks but others will actually, of course, maintain in the period. So there will be a mix with the surcharge, but customers are looking at things like self-gifting. And if somebody's buying something for themselves at the holidays, if it can take extra time, then they will actually activate that to smooth the volume out of say something like a Cyber Monday. That helps their fulfillment centers. It helps also the level of peak spike that occurs. So that's one of the mechanisms, the surcharge, to help steer some of that controllable aspect of consumer demand while other aspects, of course, are committed times and needing to flow as committed. So that's some of it.", "And then the operating plans and the use of Saturday delivery and pickup, as I mentioned previously, are items that are helping to steer where possible, activating our Saturday pickup, which is market-leading. Enables packages to be delivered on Monday from shipped on Saturday. And that's proving to be popular with customers and very positively received. Thank you.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "We're going to take an Internet question from Allison Landry. Allison's question is:", "How much B2C growth did you see during the quarter with brick-and-mortar? And is it outpacing growth from Amazon? What are you expecting? Are you expecting these trends to continue in the upcoming peak season?", "Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Hey, this is Alan. I'll take that. Yeah. So as you saw in our results, we had another strong quarter of B2C growth, up high-single digits in U.S. domestic. But I do want to also note that it's up mid-teens in our International business, and we certainly expect this to continue. The customers out there, both in the U.S. and internationally are responding well to the UPS industry-leading e-commerce value stack. And that's broad-based growth. It's really coming from the bricks and clicks, brick-and-mortar retailers, along with the e-commerce pure-plays. And it's also coming broad-based from a customer size perspective in middle-market, small and medium businesses, and also enterprise.", "Some of the solutions out there that are really resonating are our newly created Saturday operations that includes Saturday pickup in addition to Saturday delivery that expedites shipments for Monday delivery. And then, obviously, on My Choice, our UPS lockers, our Marketplace Shipping tools and Access Points.", "And the one thing I want to note, this past quarter, we launched our UPS returns manager, which is a free online tool that enables merchants of all sizes to customize their consumer return services and processes, and our consumers get hassle-free return services. And we launched that in the U.S. plus 43 countries around the world. So we're building that e-commerce value stack both in the U.S. and internationally. Thanks for the question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Pat Gruck (56:42) of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, guys. It's Scott. So I apologize if this is a repeat. I've been bouncing around a couple of calls and hopefully you can coordinate better next time. But Richard, just on the fourth quarter guidance, since it's a decently wide range here, just wanted to clarify. Are you expecting domestic margin improvement in the fourth quarter? And are you still expecting Domestic margin improvement for the year? And then did you say if on the TNT benefit in the third quarter, if you are expecting any of that to continue in the fourth quarter?", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Sure, Scott. First of all, I think you asked specifically, first around the fourth quarter EPS guidance. And at the end of the day, in my talk, and you can pull the transcript, I went through unveiling the one-offs that occurred in 2016 around the tax and then the impact of the currency this year. And if you pull those out and do the math, the underlying growth is one of the stronger quarters we've had. That's the first point.", "The second point is we recognize that we'll continue to see both on International and Supply-Chain about what we expected, but we also know in the U.S., IP has come down a little bit post hurricane. We looked at Sandy and Katrina and saw recovery was about a 6 to 12 month process. And so overall we think Domestic is about where we expected it to be, and it's about where we expect it to be given the one-time hurricane and weather. And year-over-year for the fourth quarter we do expect operating margin to increase for the U.S. Domestic.", "So we've put it all together, we feel really comfortable, and that's why we moved up our range. And at the end as Kate and Myron and Alan have talked about, we spent a lot of time planning and working with our customers to ensure the fourth quarter is good and we deliver a good peak season for customers and investors. Thank you.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "So just if I'm clear, so if we kind of normalize for the hurricane, you're still expecting Domestic package margin improvement for the year.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "You've got to normalize for the call it \u2013 there was also some other quarters where there were some one times, but overall we think we're right on plan if you go back and look at what we've talked about.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you, guys", "Operator", "We have another question from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to the topic of facility expansions. I know you said you're added 1 million square feet this year and looking at 5.5 million square feet next year. If you could just remind us over the next three to five years. I think, Richard, on the last call you mentioned it was about 28 million to 35 million square footage that you might need to add. Is there a potential that that could come down as you get better efficiency built into these facilities? And what sort of capital investments do you think that fully deploying that square footage might entail over the next three to five years? Thank you.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "So, Brian, I'm going to specifically talk about where we are right now. We have moved forward some of our especially outer-year land purchases. But what we're also seeing as a growth rate that's at the higher end of where we originally guided to. And so I think we said all along there are tweaks as I mentioned a moment ago, based on how volume comes in, capabilities, you know technology keeps changing, and as technology changes there's additional capabilities we have to think about in terms of how do we automate it? Because anytime we can automate that it helps the efficiency and the movement in the network.", "It's a little early to talk about the three-to-five year other than what we've guided, but I think as we close out the planning for 2018 I'll come back to it.", "The one thing we should talk about though is if you look at the Next Day Air and the International growth rates obviously, and the air capacity, we've now grown probably closer to 25% since we last bought a plane in either the International or the Domestic. So we keep looking at that to make sure that we have the right capital because at the end of the day those are great returns and investment in the business is the right thing to do. Thank you.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "That concludes our Q&A segment for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Scott Childress. Please go ahead, sir.", "Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "I'll hand the call to Richard for some comments.", "Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Yeah. I just wanted to make a few brief comments around some of what's going on around tax reform because with the potential that's unique for UPS is where taxpayers that pays between 34% and 35%. So because of that we continue to look at how do we optimize based on knowing the changes that might occur, and what's in front of us. And what that means is we continue to look at all of our strategies and make sure we're making the necessary adjustments.", "So we will continue to do that. David is actively engaged, along with the rest of the senior management team, and getting our story out about why we think the competitiveness in the U.S. improves when you bring the tax rate down because we create jobs, and we also can invest in a different way than we currently are.", "So, there's a lot more to come in this area, but I thought it was important for you all to hear our view that obviously with this change it's a generational thing, and we are planning for it and thinking about it in the right way. And with that I'll turn it over to David.", "David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, Rich. As you can see, we are transforming our network for growth and long-term value. We're making great progress, especially in our Smart Logistics Network. Our strategies and investments are paying off, providing good positive returns, and we continue to see good growth opportunities for UPS. And, of course, for the next month or two, we're focused on delivering a successful holiday, both for our customers and our investors, and thank you for joining the call. I appreciate it.

My name is Steven, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is now yours.", "Scott Childress", "Good morning, and welcome to the UPS Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn. Also joining us today is Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer.", "Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we\u2019ll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectation for the future performance or results of operation of our Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K and 2017 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "During the quarter, UPS recorded a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $607 million. The charge resulted from lower discount rates and was partially offset by higher asset returns. Also, in the quarter as a result of tax legislation in 2017, we recorded a one-time income tax benefit of $258 million.", "In the prior year period, UPS recorded a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $1.7 billion. The charge resulted from lower discount rates somewhat offset by asset returns. More details on the mark-to-market accounting are available in a presentation on the UPS Investor Relations website.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2017 was $1.27. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market pension charges and the one-time tax benefit, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.67, while fourth quarter 2016 GAAP diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.27 and adjusted earnings per share was $1.63.", "Unless stated otherwise, discussions today will refer to adjusted results. The webcast of today\u2019s call along with the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Webcast users can submit live questions during today\u2019s call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.", "Now, I will turn the call over to David.", "David Abney", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone.", "In 2017, UPS made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, expanding our capabilities, implementing new technology, and further penetrating high-growth markets. The successful execution of our growth strategies was apparent in the strong revenue gains made across all segments of the business.", "In the fourth quarter, we produced one of the highest revenue growth rates of the last decade. Revenue grew by more than 11% to nearly $19 billion and we generated healthy returns on capital investments. The International and Supply Chain and Freight segments exceeded our expectations. They\u2019re well-positioned, as favorable market conditions and strong execution, are driving their results.", "The International segment generated their 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in operating profit. The Supply Chain and Freight business delivered over 20% revenue growth and expanded operating profit more than 50%. Demand in our U.S. segment reached record levels with revenue up more than 8% during the quarter. However, headwinds from capacity constraints due to cyber-period volume surges weighed on our results. Following my remarks, U.S. Operations President, Myron Gray and International President, Jim Barber will provide additional comments.", "I just returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos. I left more optimistic about the global economy and the opportunities that exist. Given the favorable economic outlook and the momentum we\u2019ve carried over from 2017, we expect demand for our services to be robust throughout 2018. To support this growth, we\u2019re bringing our largest network expansion in recent history, online this year.", "Another reason for optimism is the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is already producing economic growth and improving U.S. competitiveness around the world. We applaud Congress and the President for taking bold action to boost the U.S. economy. The savings we\u2019re realizing from tax reform will enable us to unlock significant resources across the organization.", "UPS will increase investments in our people, technology, fleets, facilities, and our portfolio. This will generate more value for our customers, more opportunities for our people, and greater returns for our shareowners. The growth in ecommerce, cross-border trade, and the needs of our customers for specialized services are creating unprecedented demand for our domestic and international air services.", "Given the benefits from the tax act and our tremendous growth opportunities, we\u2019re announcing the purchase of 14 additional 747-8 aircraft and four new Boeing 767 Freighters. While we are investing and transforming our global network, we have also expanded the scope of transformation at UPS. Our team is rapidly moving through the evaluation stage and identifying additional multiyear, value-creating opportunities. We look forward to sharing more information with you later this year.", "Looking at global market conditions, the healthy mixture of consumer spending, manufacturing activity, and business investment should lead to a strong 2018. In the U.S., economists have raised their views of 2018 GDP growth by 50 basis points above last year and now expect industrial production growth above 3%. Outside the U.S., growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018, driven by the increased pace of global trade. I am encouraged by the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives and by the direction of the global economy.", "Before I turn it over to Myron, I\u2019d like to recognize two management changes. First, I want to welcome Scott Price to the UPS team. He is leading our new enterprise-wide transformation initiatives and heads our corporate strategy team. He brings broad experience in international trade, retail and the logistics industry. I also want to wish Alan Gershenhorn the very best in retirement. Alan has made an enduring impact on UPS for the past 38 years. He helped us grow from a $3 billion small package business to a more than $65 billion global leader. Alan, thanks for your many contributions. I also want to personally thank the 435,000 UPSers around the world, for their extraordinary determination, efforts and achievements throughout 2017.", "Myron?", "Myron Gray", "Thanks and good morning.", "UPS had record volume levels during peak, demonstrating continued strong demand for our services. We made 762 million deliveries worldwide, which was 7% more than last year and 12 million more than our initial plan. In fact, we delivered more than 30 million packages on 90% of the days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. By comparison, just two years ago, only 20% of peak days were over 30 million.", "While growth was strong, variability of digital demand created challenges during the peak period, as volume accelerated above our projections. In fact, in the U.S. online orders created during the record settings Cyber Weekend resulted in nearly 20% more package volume than last year. Coming out of the weekend, volume growth continued to be strong. The early surge pushed our U.S. network above its maximum capacity. The added cost increased operating expense by about $125 million. We recovered well after managing this initial surge with improvements in a broad range of measures including cost per unit and on-time service.", "Our strategies and investments are focused on operating our network with the higher degree of real-time flexibility. Using the latest technology, we\u2019re optimistic about the future. As we move quickly to bring new capabilities online and adapt UPS operations. Our actions will strengthen the operational leverage that generates long-term value for investors.", "This year, you will see a significant shift in technology-enabled volume processing with the phase-in of much more highly automated capacity. Worldwide, we expect to open 18 new retrofit faculties in 2018. This includes three major U.S. ground hubs, the first major ground hubs we\u2019ve added in more than two decades. The overwhelming majority of these facilities will be here in the U.S. and key geographies that were constrained during peak. In total, these new permanent facilities will add more than 5 million square feet of flexible, technology-driven capabilities.", "In 2018, we\u2019re adding 6 times more sorting capacity and 3 times as many car positions as we added last year. Additionally, we\u2019re enhancing the efficiency of our air network in 2018, adding nine incremental aircraft to the UPS fleet including six 747-8 and three converted 767s. Also in the air network, we\u2019re upgrading our regional air hubs to greatly enhance throughput efficiency. These hubs will help Worldport better manage weather and spread peak volume surges to more locations.", "In 2018, customers will get more Saturday options at UPS and will reach a total of 5,800 cities and towns, when the rollout is complete later this year. In the area of enhanced technology, we have several key initiatives coming online. We\u2019re implementing the next generation release of UPS network planning tools and starting the initial rollout of dynamic ORION technology in 2018.", "We are also expanding our virtual assistant and help center technologies to improve accuracy, while also streamlining customer support. Mobile technology will expand with Dynamic Sort and new delivery applications, and we are implementing smart trailer technology across 100% of our fleet, which supports digital, real-time location and greatly improves utilization. All of these tools will enable our facilities and our network to more efficiently manage package flow and growth. Additionally, we are focused on other actions to help manage fields and to ensure our pricing is aligned with our cost to serve.", "I am encouraged by what stands before us, the vast growth opportunities and network enhancements that enables UPS to fulfill the high demand for our services. UPS operates a global logistics network, connecting the world.", "And now, Jim will share his comments on our International businesses. Jim?", "Jim Barber", "Thanks, Myron, and good morning.", "As David mentioned earlier, the International segment and the Supply Chain and Freight segment generated excellent top and bottom line results during the fourth quarter. Our international value preposition is to offer powerful global network and portfolio that connects buyers and sellers through seamless cross-border movements at the right time and price for their needs. This positions us to benefit from strong year-end demand typical of peak season. In fact, this year reflects our capacity during peak to deliver about 35% to 40% more volume versus our average daily levels.", "As a result of our team\u2019s strong execution, the International segment generated revenue growth of nearly 13% in the fourth quarter with balanced growth across all markets. Operating profit increased 19% on a currency neutral basis, our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit gains. These results are really the outcome of work begun four years ago.", "In Europe, the $2 billion investment cycle is allowing to reach the increased network speed and capacity. In the fourth quarter, Pan European exports increased more than 20%. This year, we will have even more capability for growth, as we open new hubs in Paris, London, and in Netherlands. In Asia, we are driving greater market access and capability expansion in China, and other markets. We\u2019ve built the customer base to fill the new air capacity coming online, from the new 747-8 freighters. We are serving key lanes, leveraging our Shenzhen air hub for access into and out of the region with high utilization rates.", "In 2015, the Supply Chain and Freight segment rebuilt our foundation for success by strengthening cost management, aligning with customers who committed to grow with us, and positioning the business for the overall market rebound. On these pillars, the global forwarding and distribution units delivered an impressive fourth quarter with revenue up more than 25%, while both approaching double-digit margins. Like the International segment, this group also built a series of improved quarterly performances through 2017.", "While the power of our network, portfolio and people are largely responsible for our results, we know that to stay on the path for profitable growth we also need to expand our relationships and capabilities. We completed four strategic acquisitions and into new alliances during 2017 that are providing new solutions and connectivity for customers worldwide.", "First, we established a joint venture with SF Express, the leading logistics provider in China. Together, we are leveraging our complementary networks. And we\u2019ve launched a great lower cost international solution that\u2019s gaining strong customer acceptance.", "UPS was also selected as the official logistics partner for Expo 2020 Dubai. We\u2019ve already expanded our network to support our growing customer base in the Middle East, including a new direct flight between Dubai and Worldport.", "The Company made great regional and local market capability acquisitions in Europe with Freightex and Nightline Logistics. These deals brought local knowledge and market savvy, plus gave us access to a broader customer base. Integration is going according to plan and these units are already making solid contributions to the business.", "In summary, our International business is operating in an opportunity-rich market populated by cross-border commerce. I\u2019m very optimistic about our prospects for continued strong top and bottom-line contributions to UPS\u2019s overall business.", "Thanks. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Richard.", "Richard Peretz", "Thanks, Jim.", "During the fourth quarter, UPS produced outstanding revenue growth of over 11%. Top-line gains were balanced across all business segments. Earnings per share came in at $1.67 and full year EPS was $6.01 despite an almost $0.30 headwind from currency.", "As you heard, significant network enhancements are forthcoming. We\u2019re executing well on our growth strategies. And the scope of transformation has expanded. The new tax reforms recently passed provide UPS with unique opportunities, and the economic outlook is calling for synchronized global growth, all good things for our business.", "Now, turning to the segments in the quarter. In the U.S., revenue increased $922 million or 8.4%. Ground and Deferred Air revenue were up over 9%. Volume growth was up 5.4%, nearly all industry sectors grew. Average daily ground shipments improved by 5.7% and Next Day Air was up almost 5%. Product yields were strong as total revenue per piece increased nearly 3%. These rates were above our target range of 2% to 3% and help offset product and customer mix. The segment was affected by operating costs associated with known projects yet to come on line by about $60 million.", "As David and Myron have discussed, cost around the cyber-period was above our expectations in the quarter. We estimate the impact of the additional expense to be about $125 million. Domestic operating profit was slightly below $1.3 billion for the quarter.", "Now, looking at the International segment, which produced outstanding results with revenue growth of almost 13% on continued strong export shipments, the segment overachieved on our financial targets. International revenue for package increased 4.2% as yield initiatives drove strong base rate. Premium products grew faster than non-premium as they have done all year. The segment\u2019s operating profit was $760 million, up 7.6%. Adjusting for currency, profit increased almost 19%.", "Let\u2019s turn to Supply Chain and Freight. Total revenue increased 21% with gains across all business units. The operating profit was up more than 50% to $270 million, the highest ever for the segment. And operating margins expanded just 8.3%. Forwarding and distribution revenue increased more than 25% to $2.3 billion.", "UPS Freight revenue climbed 11% on higher shipments, solid tonnage growth and disciplined pricing strategies. The unit\u2019s focus on profitable middle market growth contributed solid operating profit gains and margin expansion. Prior investments and active strategies in the Supply Chain and Freight as well as the International segment produced outstanding returns. We expect similar results in the U.S. Domestic segment, as the investments go live and we implement key growth and pricing strategies.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet. In 2017, we used our strong cash flow, to reward shareowners, and took opportunistic action to lower risks. First, the Company paid a growing dividend to $2.9 billion and repurchased more than 16 million shares for about $1.8 billion. And second, we significantly lowered our long-term pension risk and planned redesign early in 2017. And at the end of the year, we made a tax efficient contribution to the pensions of $5 billion as a result of the new tax legislation.", "The funding allows us to optimize the tax benefit, lower ongoing expense, and further unlock cash flow, moving forward. The Company made capital expenditures in 2017 of $5.2 billion to advance our strategic investments. And it positions UPS to capitalize on the additional growth opportunities before us.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn to our guidance. Overall, the positive economic outlook and the benefits from tax reform will push our EPS guidance for 2018 above our long-term target. The full benefits of these tailwinds will be dampened by lower discount rates, the timing of projects coming on line and using some of the tax benefits strategically in the second half of the year, also the effect of the new transformation initiatives are not included in our guidance.", "Moving to the segments. In U.S., we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%. Operating profit will include a drag of approximately $200 million, resulting from lower pension discount rates. Additionally, incremental upfront operating penalties associated with opening new buildings and the expansion of Saturday operations will be an additional $50 million. The timing of projects and go-live open dates will create larger drags in the first and second quarter. ", "Turning to the International segment. We are planning outstanding year of industry-leading financial results with revenue and operating profits at the high end of our targeted range. Revenue growth should be between 7% and 9%; operating profit is projected to grow between 10% and 12%. And in the Supply Chain and Freight segment, we anticipate the current momentum to continue with topline improvements of 6% to 8% and operating profit growth of 10% to 12%. With contribution from all the business units, we expect another year of outstanding results in this segment.", "At the total Company level, let me begin by talking about the recent tax change. These changes have a material impact on UPS\u2019s net income and cash flow, given our prior 35% tax rate. A number of detailed regulations are still being finalized. We will continue to monitor and update our expected rates as needed. Currently, we estimate our 2018 tax rate to be between 23% and 24%, and the first quarter to be about 200 basis points lower, due to the stock compensation accounting. Further, we expect to use around 20% of the benefit from tax reform to fund strategic initiatives in the second half of the year to enhance the value of our business for our customers, employees and shareowners.", "Ultimately, the net impact of the tax benefits to EPS is expected to be between $0.80 and $0.85. Our capital priorities remain the same. First, as a result to the new tax laws and our growth outlook, we\u2019re moving up our capital investment level. In 2018, it will be between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. These levels assure we have significant improvements in our global network over the next several years, all while maintaining our industry best return on invested capital of between 23% and 28%.", "Second, we plan to reward shareowners with another year of growth in dividends, subject to Board approval and we\u2019re planning share buybacks of approximately $1 billion in 2018. Overall, Company performance will be strong. As a result, we are forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.03 to $7.37, which includes additional expense for pension, Saturday expansion and start-up costs of new automated facilities as well as the strategic investments we\u2019ll make in the second half of 2018.", "As we look at the quarters, we anticipate the first quarter EPS growth to be between 15% and 18% as U.S. Domestic expands Saturday operations and increases expense for other projects. EPS growth rate will accelerate in the second and third quarters as project benefits increase. This year, there are two new accounting changes that will be implemented. Overall, these changes do not impact earnings per share growth. However, they will affect the segment results. We will provide you with additional detail and recast prior periods to reflect the adoption of the new accounting standards throughout 2018.", "Our current investment cycle is similar to other periods in our history where we invested to build in airline, a global business model and our supply chain capability. The initial short-term costs are soon replaced by long-term shareowner value. The multiyear strategy we laid out is in motion. UPS is in the right growth markets. Our solutions are resonating with our customers around the world and the opportunities before us are vast.", "Thank you. And now, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Please ask only one question, so that we may accommodate more callers. Feel free to get back into the queue and we will take a second question, time permitting. Our first question\u2026", "Scott Childress", "I\u2019m sorry, Steven. We\u2019ll go online question first. We\u2019ve got a question from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. How confident are you in your ability to improve domestic margins in 2018? Can you help us bridge the margin gap between that and your long-term targets?", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. Allison, this is Richard. Good morning. Overall, when we look at 2018, the first thing we know is the growth in the U.S. remains strong and that strength we saw not only in the fourth quarter, but really we sequentially have seen it in \u201816 and \u201817, and it\u2019s both on the volume side as well as the yield being at the higher end. We also know that some of the efficiencies that we\u2019re getting in operations were masked both by our investment dollars and the op penalties we\u2019ve talked about, but also from the higher cyber-period volume levels.", "In 2018, it\u2019s not just all the new buildings that we\u2019re opening, but it\u2019s really also the beginning of some of the technology that\u2019s going to power the global smart logistics network going forward Myron talked about in his talk.", "So, we expect 2018 to have some challenges because of the investment dollars, but probably the biggest challenge we\u2019ll have domestically is the unplanned discount rate change. If you look over the last two weeks of December, we saw fluctuations in discount rates of between 20 and 40 basis points to where we ended up at the end of the year. And that has a big impact on the net operating costs. We also know that since this year has started, the longer term interest rate is starting to get more normalized shape on the curve, and that\u2019s going to help us as we remeasure pensions going forward in future years. But, this year, we don\u2019t know that drag around $200 million is going to be something that we\u2019re going to have to deal with. But at the same time, the underlying business remains strong. We are putting the initiatives in place. And we are implementing the technology that\u2019s really going to drive the savings of the 800 to $1 billion we laid out for the global smart logistics network.", "Scott Childress", "We\u2019re going to take another online question. We have got a number of questions, four or five, about the international business, Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan, Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer, Jack Atkins. And really, it\u2019s about how large can the International segment become? Are we positioned given the growth and the optimistic outlook that we are seeing? And then, can you tell us what the real potential there is?", "Jim Barber", "Okay. Brian, it\u2019s Jim, I guess, and Jack and Scott. Look, we talk about this quite often within the management committee. With 95% of the consumers outside of the United States, a good piece of that in emerging markets which aligns to one of our Tier 1 strategies. Personally, I think that at some point in the future as our business continues to diversify, International will probably become bigger and larger for our shareholders than Domestic. We can\u2019t say when. We certainly want to continue to invest in and keep the U.S. Domestic business growing, because it\u2019s the foundation of UPS and we don\u2019t want to lose that. But, the world continues to move; cross-border continues to grow seven times as fast as most domestic economies. The trick is to be there at the right time at the right place. We do get the competition it gets a little bit more complex from my perspective in each of the countries you go into, you go heads up against the post usually, a national champion, another integrator and maybe some new entrants. And so, the trick for us is to get to the right place at the right time. You\u2019ve seen that over the last couple of years, we will continue that strategy, and we hope all of our businesses continue to grow with pace but hopefully International continues to speed up and deliver for us. So, thanks for the question.", "Operator", "Question from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Good morning. Richard, I wanted to see if you could add some more perspective on cash flow and how you are thinking about uses of cash, probably like -- maybe both 2018 and if you want, 2019? The CapEx number obviously is a bit higher. What are your thoughts on, is there another big contribution to pension, is there remaining room for share buyback or do you kind of put share buyback on hold as you look at the higher CapEx spend and however pension [weaves] [ph] into that? Thank you.", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. So, to step back for a moment, Tom, our priorities haven\u2019t changed. The number one priority is to reinvest in the business. We have maintained and continue to perform a return on invested capital that is the best in the industry. We also think the dividend is an important component of our capital structure. And as I mentioned in my talk, with Board approval, we expect to keep growing the dividend.", "And at the same time, flexibility is important in the balance sheet. The way I look at it is, we made a $5 billion contribution at the end of the year, really for three reasons. And one of them was it was tax efficient. That contribution was made at a time when you write it off at the higher tax rate of the legacy rate versus the new rate. Second, it improves cash flow, not only this year, but likely for the next few years. And then third, it lowers costs. If you think about the rising PBGC premiums which are going to be 380 basis points that you\u2019ll pay in unfunded pension, my borrowing cost is more than 150 basis points below that.", "So, we\u2019re going to continue to manage responsibly. We continue to believe that the strong cash flow from operations allows us to do all of this. And at the same time, taking advantage of the new tax laws with the CapEx that\u2019s really used to continue to grow our business, but also we get the 100% deduction for the next five years. So, when you put it all together, the [priorities] [ph] aren\u2019t any different, we expect the same amount of return. And I guess the last thing is, if these discount rates do start coming back up, it\u2019s a dramatically different view of both the liability side and the entire pension world. It\u2019s just been like almost 9 or 10 years since we\u2019ve been in the normalized discount rate environment. No one expected them to be at what really are all time lows to more than 20, 30 years.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon", "One of the core issues here seems to be being able to price and get the productivity that you need to get earnings leverage in the domestic segment. Are you guys going to be making any changes commercially to how you approach the market in terms of the aggressiveness on fee increases or surcharges, based on what looks like another sort of tough year in terms of getting operating leverage to the Domestic segment?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Dave, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. First of all, as you know, our strategy has been for quite some time to target base price increases in the range of 2% to 3%. And certainly, in the fourth quarter of \u201817, we did a phenomenal job with that. We actually finished with our base pricing above the high end of the target. And it\u2019s one of the strongest consolidated RPP growth quarters that we had in the last decade. And it has been aided by some of the revenue management initiatives that we put in place. We\u2019re certainly doing a lot more with surgically managing our contracts, DIM weight has been a nice tailwind and this year we\u2019ve now expanded that to the under one cube.", "And again, we\u2019re focused really on the management of the accessorials including the additional handling fees, large package surcharge and you may have noticed that we more than doubled the price of over max. So, yes, we\u2019re really focused on managing the yield, and keeping it between that 2% to 3%. And I think what\u2019s really exciting is the fact that we were able to achieve those yield gains with some of the higher volume growths that we\u2019ve seen in -- and by the way that\u2019s happening both domestically, internationally and in our Supply Chain segments as you can see with the fantastic revenue growth we had this past quarter.", "David Vernon", "Given that we are getting that accelerating volume under the accelerating pricing, do you feel like you have a better opportunity there to use price to get ahead of this?", "Alan Gershenhorn", "Yes. Certainly, we\u2019re going to continue to manage the enterprise customers in the middle market and with the goal of achieving those target-based price increases in the 2% to 3% range.", "David Abney", "This is David. And to summarize, Alan, no doubt about it, we are always analyzing our pricing alternatives. We want to make sure that we get compensated for the value that we provide. We believe that this year was a good step on that journey. We also believe there is more work to be done and we are going to continue to focus in that area. Thank you.", "Scott Childress", "We\u2019re going to take a online question. This question comes from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa Bank. How would Amazon\u2019s entry into pharmaceutical impact UPS\u2019s prescription delivery operation? ", "David Abney", "This is David Abney. Thanks for question. First, I\u2019d have to tell you that we don\u2019t know exactly what Amazon is going to do in this area. There has been a lot of rumors and there has been some indications, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see. What we can tell you is that a few years ago, we identified the health care as a Tier 1 initiative; we felt that our capabilities lined up very well with the needs of the market. And we have been customizing solutions, not only in the pharmaceutical side, but in the other aspects of health care. And whether it\u2019s coming directly from manufacturers or using distributors is just an area that we see our expertise, the complexity of the supply chain, the fact that it is global, and pharmaceutical is a good example of that and it\u2019s been a good opportunity for us. As new players may come into the market, we believe that we will take advantage of our capabilities, and we\u2019ll continue to improve our capabilities in that area. Thank you.", "Scott Childress", "We are going to take another online question; this one is from Allison Laundry of Credit Suisse. How much additional revenue did UPS generate from peak surcharges in the fourth quarter, and how successful have your surcharges been in moving customer demand?", "Kate Gutmann", "Great. Good morning, Allison. This is Kate. Thanks for the question. So, with our peak season, surcharges for residential deliveries and large packages, we achieved our revenue target, and we were able to better align price with our cost to serve. We acquired as you may be aware, the residential during specific high volume periods and large packages for the full peak period. We have also announced in our 2018, peak surcharge plan for the -- in our GRI, and that\u2019s helping our customers to budget. As David mentioned, we have further to go over max, which is package characteristics outside of our weight and size limitations, did enter the network. We see that as an opportunity to go further. As Alan indicated, we are in 2018 and we are working with our customers to address that specific area. Thank you.", "David Abney", "This is David. Just to add to what Kate said. We believe also that these peak surcharges did help us to some extent shape the volume around the period, especially peak week. We were able to get packages moved into the week before and non-critical packages moved the week after. We\u2019ll say that around Cyber Week, we didn\u2019t have quite the success that we thought we would into shaping. And we are going to look at that and that will be an area of focus for this year.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Chris Wetherbee", "I wanted to talk about CapEx for a moment and take a look back, over the last many years, we haven\u2019t seen anything sort of approaching this, but get your point about sort of building you\u2019re your fleet in previous decades. Maybe you can put into some context maybe the duration of the spend. We\u2019ve seen a really rapid ramp up from a fairly stable level couple of years ago. How long would you anticipate sort of these elevated levels? And can you give us any sort of benchmarks to use as a percent of revenue and maybe absolute dollars for that period of time? That would be helpful.", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. Again, Chris, this is Richard. And I think, the first thing you have to look at is, there are -- and we talked about between 25% and 30% growth from 2013 until this year, when we finally first took another plane. If you think about the value creation of our air products and our international products, and it\u2019s apparent that that\u2019s an area where we want invest as much as we can, as often as we can, because it does bring return very quickly to the bottom-line. And so, now, we\u2019re going to have a total of almost 28, 747s, as well as about seven 767 that we\u2019ve announced.", "At the end of the day, the next few years, we expect these kind of levels, somewhere between 9% and 10%, 8.5% and 10% of revenues to stay. In fact, our plans right now for the next three year are stay pretty much as these kind of levels. And it\u2019s accretive to the business and then you get the 100% deductibility for your investments. If you go back a few years, we kind of announced almost something similar in the International business where about -- by the end of this year will be about 75% of the way through the investments and we\u2019re all seeing the kind of results we\u2019re getting out of that. So, we see that as a good proof point. And with that as the technology and what we\u2019re doing in the business, we believe that these are the right places to put the dollars; it\u2019s got the best return on invested capital; and it\u2019s going to bring the return that we expect.", "David Abney", "And just one small point to add is that if you\u2019ve been following us for quite a while, then you do know that we\u2019ve had these kind of elevated CapEx percent of revenue before. It\u2019s just that over the recent five or six years we\u2019ve been at this lower level. But, if you look at a longer timeframe, you\u2019re going to see that this is not really an exception; this is maybe slightly higher, but very close to what we have averaged. So yes, for the next few years, we are really growing our international export business and our premium products. We see that this is an opportunity to take advantage of that and we are certainly going to do so.", "Scott Childress", "We\u2019re going to take another online question. This one is from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Bascome has, what led to the external executive hire of Scott Price, Chief Transformation Officer, what objectives has management set, and is there any time horizons that you can gave us?", "David Abney", "Okay. This is David. I\u2019ll answer. And we are very happy to have Scott with his experience come and join us. We have brought people in from the outside on many occasions from outside the Company, we never, at this level, but we believe with the pace of change, and that is just good to maybe add to our expertise with a little bit of external perspective, although Scott has been in the industry for quite a while.", "Our focus is going to be on growing the business, on finding efficiencies throughout the business and creating opportunities for our Company and our employees. But, we have to examine all parts of our business. So, if there is one thing that I made it very clear to Scott is that there is an open canvas, there is nothing protected; I want to examine all parts of our business. We are rapidly moving through our evaluation stage now. I focus on rapidly because Scott\u2019s spend here six weeks or so and he is really made a lot of gains and he is working quickly with our team. We are identifying multiyear value creation opportunities. And we will be sharing more, later in the year, really excited about this opportunity, and Scott has the full support of the entire management team. Thank you.", "Scott Childress", "We\u2019ve got another online question here, this one from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Can you give us some more updates on the efficiencies generated with ORION and the other technologies that you are implementing?", "Myron Gray", "Yes. So, this is Myron. We are implementing key operations technologies; that\u2019s a multiyear process. We anticipate that when fully deployed, these technologies will result in 800 to a $1 billion annually at full implementation. This includes ORION, NPT, EDGE, as well as the facility automation. As we continue to build out this network of the future, it will certainly provide us with greater flexibility, greater connectivity to our customers, and capacity and efficiency. This year, we will continue to roll out Phase 2 of ORION, which obviously is dynamic route optimization to over 130 centers and 1,400 drivers. Phase 1 of ORION, we netted greater than our expected targeted savings of 6 to 8 miles per driver and over $410 million.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Ken Hoexter", "Great. Good morning. So, just looking back to the last few years, you talked a lot about the control tower through peak season to ensure you didn\u2019t get swamped again. It sounded like there were some capacity issues in the beginning. What in hindsight, and then going forward, what needs to be changed or adjusted on that ability to control the volumes, or is it if volumes come, we just need to take it and scale the network as quick as possible? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that David?", "Kate Gutmann", "Thank you, Ken. This is Kate. I\u2019ll take that. You are correct. The collaboration as well as the control tower in forecasting that we did with our customers this year actually increased in collaboration. Also, we added location level planning to this. And for the peak period, it actually worked very well. The forecasts were aligned and the control tower, which is the request of the large customers to go above their forecast, worked well. The example of that is peak week, as David mentioned, worked especially well during those critical last few days to do the wrap up, and gave us a strong finish.", "But Cyber Week and weekend was the exception, and definitely more demand in the market than planned. You may have seen that the National Retail Federation noted that holiday retail sales came in 5.5% or almost 45% higher than their forecast. And that marks the fastest pace of growth in the post-recession era. So, definitely, more demand in the market, and as a result, more demand than we forecasted at UPS and then our customers forecasted.", "We did have some customers that were able to shift volume into the two weeks after Cyber Week through self gifting promotions and even giving promotion dollars back to customers. And we are going to emphasize that initiative with additional retailers to help move some of that demand into the latter week. But, as Myron noted earlier, we did deliver, over 90% of the days were over 30 million packages. So that increased demand. And we will take all these learnings for Cyber Week and apply them to 2018 and just as we\u2019ve been able to really make some significant impact in the other weeks of the peak period.", "David Abney", "Yes. Just one last thing on Cyber Week. That old saying that rising tides lift all boats that\u2019s the thing that we were facing. If it was 2 or 3 large customers, the control tower -- it\u2019s 20 large customers, the control tower can be very effective in those regards. But, this was not just the large customers, this was throughout the network. And this is something that was in our network, but it was in the other networks throughout the country too. So that is why we\u2019ve got to really take a look at for Cyber Week. One of the things is we\u2019ve added a lot of additional capacity this year that has been covered and much more than in 2017, and we\u2019ve added more technology. So, I know that we\u2019ve been in much better shape from that regard. But, we\u2019re going to take a good look at the control tower and what we need to do around Cyber Week and we\u2019ll be talking about that further in the year.", "Scott Childress", "We\u2019re going to take an online question; this comes from Jack Atkins of Stephens. Do the benefits of the Tax and Jobs Act to the economy, combined with improve trade lead you to believe that you should be positioned to exceed your long-term earnings per share targets?", "David Abney", "Okay. This is David. I\u2019ll take the first part of the question and I\u2019ll hand it over to Rich. First, we want to applaud the President and Congress for passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We really believe that it\u2019s going to stimulate the economy and create jobs, and those jobs are going to create more shipments, which creates more jobs and more opportunities for UPS. It certainly makes the American companies more competitive. And we\u2019re also encouraged about the trade. Trade last year did exceed the percent growth of GDP. And at the same time that we are encouraged, we\u2019re a little cautious too. We have matter [ph] that is being negotiated now and we certainly hope and expect that it will be modernized, but it will stay in place. And we hope that other trade agreements, Brexit and those things that they have a pretty smooth conclusion, so that they will continue to be a boost of trade and not the opposite. So that being said, I\u2019ll turn it over to Richard, Company specific.", "Richard Peretz", "Sure. So, Jack, first, we put out guidance, it\u2019s somewhat around 20% EPS growth, and we also told you that between $0.80 and $0.85 of that is for the net benefit of tax, which in essence tells you that somewhere around a third of it is underlying business. That\u2019s even with a hit for the discount rate that we had called out. So, if you think about it, we are already seeing that economic activity, our guidance on the revenue numbers of all the segments are at the higher end of our range that we laid out last year. And so, we do believe that the tax reform is creating economic growth. We also believe that we\u2019re participating in that. Unfortunately some of that masked because of both the discount rates and the investments we are making. But at the end of the day, we are seeing a pretty good growth rate, even taking the headwinds that we mentioned.", "Scott Childress", "We are going to take another online question. We\u2019ve got a number of questions coming in about the competitive landscape in Europe and our ability to continue to win share in that market?", "Jim Barber", "Okay, Scott. This is Jim, by the way. I think that we get this question quite often. Frankly, it\u2019s about the TNT situation and the cyber attack. And again, I keep reiterating this as long as I\u2019m around it. I don\u2019t know wish that on any one, any competitor or any business in this world. It did happen, it created opportunity for us. If I look at the last couple of years, I just would also like, though to reflect on the fact that we were building capabilities in Europe and European networks since we announced the $2 billion acquisition. Rich talked a minute ago about, at the end of this year, we\u2019ll be 75% of the way through; that\u2019s a capacity play. We also have launched international dangerous goods, these dangerous goods in the region to complement that. And at the same time, we continue to expand our transporter network to basically have 80 plus percent of that, knock wood, touch in two days every buyer and seller on the continent.", "So, we have invested, in my mind, nicely, irrespective of the competitive landscape. You have to pay attention to it. Very specifically, when the cyber attack did hit, we saw more customers coming to us, there is no question about that. But, I also would tell you that if I compare the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of last year, we continue to grow. So, there was a spike, but -- and then, the last thing I would tell you is, it\u2019s our job to keep those customers. And quite frankly, from what we see on our side, those -- the vast majority of those customers are staying with UPS because when they come in and start to feel the benefits of the network, they choose to stay with us. So, hopefully, we\u2019ll get into 2018 and beyond and prove that the cyber was the one-time deal for everyone, quite frankly in the market, and we just go compete and take the UPS brand to the market in Europe.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Group", "Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So, I want to try and marry some of the pricing comments and the CapEx comments. So, it sounds like, still targeting 2% to 3% pricing. I guess, I would ask why not target 4% to 5% pricing, just to pick a number, something significantly higher than what you are targeting; take a little as volume growth. And I think if you get less volume growth, maybe need to spend less on CapEx. So, as you talk about like transformation and initiatives, is something like that a major change in strategy or more price less volume, less CapEx? Is that something that is being talked about, is that on the table in any way or is that sort of not the plan right now?", "Jim Barber", "So, first of all, there is a tremendous opportunity in the market right now with the growth in the market and also the ability to grow with that market. And we continuously monitor and analyze the supply and demand, and work the price to the value of our network and the portfolio of services that we have. And then, we also surgically ensure that we\u2019re pricing to our cost to serve. And I think some great examples of that is what we\u2019ve done with dimensional weight last year and what we\u2019re doing wit it this year, what we\u2019re doing with additional handling, with the peak surcharge, with our cell by cell GRI assessments. They\u2019re all kind of great examples of that. So yes, so, we\u2019re continuing to monitor the market and analyze that and make sure that we\u2019re pricing our services for the value that we\u2019re providing and certainly returning that back to the shareowners.", "With that, I\u2019ll give it over to Richard.", "Richard Peretz", "Scott. In addition to what Alan said, if you go back to few years, our yields on a per package basis was 0.5%, 1%. So, we have taken a much more thorough look and continue to look at the yield side. But to the other side of it is also the total profit growth and how we\u2019re creating value. Because in total, as we grow profits, if we\u2019re bringing back 20 to 20 -- or 23% to 28% return on invested capital, we know we\u2019re creating more value for the shareholders. So, there is tremendous amount of effort, not on both the top-line and the bottom-line. We have a plan, and each business unit, it\u2019s very specific. And a few years ago, the same question could have been asked by about the two other business units. And now, you\u2019re seeing the result of really the strategies we\u2019ve put in place for each of those. And so, we have a deliberate strategy in the U.S. We think at the end, the shareholders will be very happy with the return we\u2019re getting. And it\u2019s really about putting all the pieces together, just as we\u2019ve done in the other segments.", "David Abney", "And just to recap, and both covered it very well. Let\u2019s don\u2019t get confused though, target pricing with a cap on pricing. Because as the opportunity creates itself, obviously, going to the top end of the target pricing or exceeding that as long, as we are providing the value and the market will hold that, we certainly look to that area. A lot about this CapEx increase that we are doing is also about bending the cost curve, reducing our cost, adjusting to this new ecommerce world that is rapidly migrating. So, it\u2019s a combination. We are not looking at pricing on one side and then separate from that we\u2019re looking it CapEx and how we can take cost out. This is an integrated model that we\u2019re constantly looking at all aspects of.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Scott Childress. Please go ahead, sir.", "Scott Childress", "Yes. I would like to thank you. And then, I\u2019ll turn it over to David for his closing comments.", "David Abney", "Okay. Before, I get into my closing comments Richard has given me hand signal. So, Richard\u2019s got something he\u2019d like to cover, and then I\u2019ll close.", "Richard Peretz", "I just want to real quickly mention that as we move into 2018, there are two accounting standards that will change segment reporting. There is revenue recognition and the pension accounting, I call it the geography of where pension accounting will break out the pieces of it and some of it will stay in operating margin and other pieces will move below the line. So, it will have an impact on the margins going forward. Before the next call, we\u2019ll probably put out some kind of schedule on the web page to give an understanding. But ultimately, all these changes do not impact EPS, but they will impact operating margin by business units, and some of those will become more volatile based on what\u2019s happening in discount rates. So for example, you could see anywhere from 125 to 250 basis-point change in Domestic; you could see anywhere around 40 to 70 in International; and in Supply Chain, between a 100 and a 150. A lot of it has to do with how you recognize revenue and then how the pieces of pension get moved around. But, it\u2019s something in 2018 we will be adopting, we will be recasting last year\u2019s numbers, but it\u2019s something that going forward we will need to talk about as we get through 2018 actuals.", "David Abney", "And as Richard said, those puts and takes, they do not affect EPS; it\u2019s just the way we look at the business units. We are, as you have heard, transforming our network for growth and we are doing it now and we were basing it on providing both value now and long-term value to our shareholders. 2018 is a big year for smart logistics network. We are adding significant capabilities both in buildings and aircraft and technology. We continue to see strong growth opportunities for UPS. We\u2019re focusing on advancing our strategies and we are doing it for our customers and for our investors. So, all that being said today, thank you for joining us on the call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our call. We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation today.
