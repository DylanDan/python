A. Davidson & Co.", "James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "I will now turn the call over to Ms. Krista Kochivar, Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Krista Kochivar - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.", "On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer, and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Krista, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $24 million or $0.03 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding after-tax special items of $188 million, we earned $212 million or $0.28 per diluted share. This is more than 1.5 times the earnings from continuing operations we reported in second quarter 2016, and an increase of about 27% from first quarter 2017.", "After-tax special items for the quarter include a $147 million noncash impairment charge related to the sale of our Uruguay operations, a $31 million charge for Flak Jacket remediation, $8 million for softwood lumber duties and $2 of merger-related cost.", "Adjusted EBITDA totaled $506 million, an improvement of 23% compared with second quarter 2016 and over 11% compared with first quarter 2017. Each of our businesses delivered strong second quarter operating results with Wood Products leveraging improving markets and ongoing operational excellence initiatives to achieve record adjusted EBITDA in the quarter.", "In addition, in the quarter, we announced the pending sale of the Uruguay operations, completed the asset value optimization process for our Western timberlands, and eliminated roughly two-thirds of the $35 million of costs formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business, and continue to expect to eliminate the remaining cost by the end of the year.", "Before covering our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Housing starts continue to move higher. After a robust start to the year, the pace of starts slowed early in the second quarter before picking back up again in June. Year-to-date, total housing starts are up approximately 4% and single-family starts are up 8%. Leading market indicators remain favorable. Employment and wages are rising, consumer confidence continues to be strong, and mortgage rates decreased from first quarter levels. Single-family permits are up 9% compared to last year and we are seeing especially strong single-family building activity in California and in the South. We expect total housing starts of approximately 1.25 million in 2017.", "Let me now turn to our business segments. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands' contribution to earnings before special items was $135 million, $13 million less than the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $222 million. Western Timberlands delivered $124 million of second quarter EBITDA, a decrease of $9 million compared with first quarter but an increase of $10 million compared to a year ago.", "The market for Western domestic logs remained strong in the second quarter, supported by robust building activity in the West and low mill inventories. Log supply remained tight as record rainfall in the Pacific Northwest continued throughout the second quarter. Domestic log sales volumes and realizations increased slightly compared with the first quarter and road and forestry costs increased seasonally even though we deferred some of the projects as a result of the wet weather.", "Turning now to our export markets, in Japan through May, total housing starts increased 2% compared to the prior year, while post-and-beam starts were up 4%. Our log sales volumes decreased slightly due to the timing shipments and average realizations were comparable to the first quarter. In China, market conditions remain favorable and log sales volumes and average realizations increased compared to the first quarter. Log inventories at Chinese ports declined slightly again in June and remain within a normalized range.", "Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $91 million to second quarter EBITDA, $5 million lower than the first quarter which benefited from seasonal seedling sales. Fee harvest volumes increased slightly compared with the first quarter and average log realizations were unchanged.", "Northern Timberlands contributed $2 million to EBITDA, a decrease of $6 million compared with the first quarter as fee harvest volumes declined seasonally due to spring breakup. Average realizations were higher as a result of a mix shift to a greater percentage of hardwood.", "The Timberlands business made good progress on its operational and excellence initiatives in the second quarter. Regional teams continue to implement best practices for harvesting and transportation. Optimizing wood flows over a larger footprint allows our teams to minimize cost and increase realizations. The business remains on track to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for 2017.", "Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $23 million to second quarter earnings and $37 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $6 million compared with first quarter but improved $9 million compared with the second quarter of last year. During the second quarter, our real estate team completed the asset value optimization or AVO process review on our 2.9 million acres of Western timberlands. The AVO process identified approximately 365,000 acres where we expect to capture our targeted premiums to the underlying timberland values. We will bring these properties to market over time including some in the second half of this year.", "Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contribution to earnings before special items was $238 million in the second quarter, an increase of 38% over the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved $67 million to $274 million, an increase of 32%. EBITDA for lumber totaled $127 million, $28 million more than the first quarter, due to a 7% increase in average sales realizations and a 5% increased in lumber sales volumes.", "EBITDA for OSB totaled $87 million, $21 million more than the first quarter and more than double the second quarter of 2016. Average sales realizations increased 12% and sales volumes were comparable to the first quarter. All of our OSB mills ran extremely well again in the second quarter.", "Engineered wood products contributed $52 million to EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million over the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased for all products during the second quarter. We also captured a larger percentage of the February price increase in the quarter than we are originally anticipated. Distribution EBITDA totaled $13 million, an increase of $5 million compared with the first quarter and an increase of $4 million compared to the second quarter of last year. The distribution business remains focused on margin improvement and controlling operating and selling cost.", "Each of the Wood Products businesses is making good progress on their respective OpEx initiatives through the first half of the year. We continue to expect collective operational excellence benefits of $55 million to $75 million from this segment in 2017.", "I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. On June 26, the Department of Commerce announced preliminary antidumping duties on Canadian lumber producers. For most producers, the duty will be approximately 7%, and will also be assessed retroactively. The antidumping duties are additive to the countervailing duties which were announced at the end of April. Combined, these duties average between 25% to 30% for most producers.", "The government will continue its investigation through the remainder of the year as the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission collect and evaluate additional information in support final determinations of the duties and the level of material injury to U.S. producers. These determinations are expected later this year. The U.S. Coalition [U.S. Lumber Coalition] continues to work closely with the Department of Commerce and we remain hopeful we will be able to reach a quota-based agreement.", "Before I turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook, let me touch on the Flak Jacket issue we disclosed last week, as well as an update on capital allocation. Regarding Flak Jacket, our top priority is to take care of our customers and their customers. We're working proactively to quickly implement solutions and remediation is already underway or completed in over 100 houses. We've halted all production sales and shipments of these products and we are collecting unused products from our customers. We are absolutely committed to doing the right thing and resolving this situation as quickly as possible.", "Finally, capital allocation. Since converting to a REIT in 2010, we have communicated a target pay-out ratio of 75% of our funds available for distribution over the cycle. Following the merger with Plum Creek and the divestiture of our Cellulose Fibers business, it is clear to us and to our board that Weyerhaeuser's cash flow profile is significantly different than it was in 2010.", "After divesting of our home building and Cellulose Fibers business, doubling our timberland holdings, and significantly improving the cost structure of our Wood Products operation, our cash flow is more stable and predictable. Considering these factors, we have determined that the company no longer requires the level of retained cash flow implied by a 75% pay-out ratio and we have made the decision to increase our target pay-out ratio to 85% over a cycle.", "Going forward the board will continue to regularly review the dividend in light of a full range of external market conditions as well as for internal improvements. We expect the biggest driver for a substantial dividend increase will be improving pricing for Southern saw logs, as that will generate a sustainable and growing earnings stream to provide strong support for the dividend over time.", "Now let me turn it over Russell to discuss our third quarter outlook.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in chart 12 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be slighter lower compared to second quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we anticipate slightly higher average sales realizations, with fee harvest volumes expected to decrease modestly compared to the second quarter.", "Japanese export log volumes will increase, while average sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher compared to the second quarter, supported by continued strong demand in Japanese housing market.", "Export log volumes to China are also expected to increase, with slightly higher average sales realizations. Third quarter domestic log sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the second quarter, with lower sales volumes.", "Western road spending was deferred due to record wet weather in the second quarter. Spending in the third quarter will increase as we expect to complete the deferred road work in addition to our typical summer road activities. Logging costs are expected to be slightly higher in the third quarter, because we tend to log in higher elevations during the summer.", "In the South, we expect higher harvest volumes if the weather improves from a very wet second quarter. We anticipate average sales realizations for the third quarter will be comparable to second quarter levels. Silviculture spending in the South is expected to increase due to seasonality as well as weather-related deferral of activities from the second quarter into the third quarter. In the North, we anticipate third quarter sales volumes to be significantly higher than the second quarter, as we move past the spring breakup season.", "Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to nearly double in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and continue to ramp up in the fourth quarter, which is when we typically expect the largest portion of the real estate transactions to close. We continue to expect over $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business in 2017.", "Turning to Wood Products, we anticipate third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to second quarter. Strong demand and low inventories throughout the supply chain have led to continued strong July pricing for lumber, OSB and engineered wood products. Overall, we expect comparable quarter-over-quarter lumber sales realizations and slightly higher OSB and engineered wood product sales realizations. Sales volumes are expected to be consistent in lumber and engineered wood products with a slight decrease in OSB.", "Looking at chart 10, unallocated items. The $26 million favorable variance in earnings before special items compared with the first quarter is primarily the result of a $14 million reduction in non-operating pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. In the second quarter of each year, we finalize prior year-end estimates. And as a result of this work, we now expect to record approximately $15 million per quarter of unallocated non-operating pension and post-retirement expense for a total of $60 million in 2017. Our total anticipated cash payments for pension and post-retirement remains unchanged at $70 million for all of 2017 with no funding required for our U.S. qualified pension plan.", "Chart 11 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $701 million, an increase of $246 million from the first quarter. Cash from operations during the quarter was $489 million, an increase of $454 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $87 million. We continue to expect our full year capital expenditures to total approximately $435 million, $300 million for Wood Products and $135 million for Timberlands.", "Moving on to debt. We ended the quarter with $6.6 billion. Earlier this week, we completed refinancing of our $550 million term loan, which was scheduled to mature in 2020, replacing it with a new $225 million term loan maturing in 2026, and prepaying $325 million in cash.", "In addition to this refinancing, we also have a scheduled bond maturity of $281 million in August of 2017. Interest expense was $100 million in the quarter. The repayment of the August maturity, which has an interest rate of 6.95% will reduce interest expense by approximately $20 million annually. We anticipate full year 2017 tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the forecasted mix of earnings from our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and look forward to your questions.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Russell. Looking forward, we are extremely well positioned to continue to capitalize on the improving housing market and remain relentlessly focused on driving value for our shareholders through operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation.", "And with that, I'd like to open up the floor for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And your first question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Southern log prices were flat quarter-over-quarter. I think that's first quarter since 2015 that prices weren't down sequentially. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in Southern log markets, are you seeing price stabilization or improvement, or was that just mix? Any kind of additional color you could give there would be helpful.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Sure. Anthony, and what we're seeing in the South is, just as you said, flat saw log pricing. At this point, we do not expect any significant improvement in saw log pricing in the third quarter. We would anticipate it would be flat with Q2. But as we move forward, we do see some potential for some pricing traction as we enter into 2018. If housing demand continues to grow, as you very well know, there's more capacity that's being put in place in the South. The Canadian share of U.S. lumber market, we believe, is going to decline due to either the duties or hopefully a negotiated agreement.", "And the other thing I would tell you that we're encouraged about is that the export markets out of the South are starting to grow and, in fact, we recently signed a contract for weekly shipments to India. We are also sending weekly shipments to an existing Western customer in China. So we think that has the potential to grow over time. So all of those things we think will ultimately lead to improvement in Southern saw log prices as we move forward.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Got it. And understood it's a probably very relatively small amount, but is it possible to quantify export shipments out of the South or maybe where you think they could be by the end of the year?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah, so like I said, we're encouraged. It is a small amount at this point in time but we think over time it could grow to 400 to 500 containers a week, which would be, just to give you a sense, equivalent to a small sawmill. So that will make a difference in the marketplace.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then just following up on the quota. There have been press reports the DOC might be near a quota that would cap Canadian share at 27% or 28%. I was just wondering if you could give any more color about your preference for a quota versus continuation of duties, and just striking the right balance between resolving the issue quickly but also making sure that your concerns and the Lumber Coalition's [U.S. Lumber Coalition] concerns are adequately addressed?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah, and as we've said, Anthony, the U.S. Coalition continues to work very closely with the Department of Commerce and we remain hopeful we'll be able to reach a quota-based agreement and we like the certainly of a negotiated agreement. However, as we've also said, we want the right agreement. And if we don't get that, we'll let the process continue to play out in terms of the duties. So, again, a lot of discussions going on. We continue to be hopeful of a negotiated quota-based agreement which we think would be the best outcome.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research", "Hey, good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Gail.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research", "I guess just staying on the Softwood Lumber Agreement, I guess the preliminary duties phase out in August and there could be a gap between final duties, just how do you expect \u2013 any sense how customers might react to that?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "That's a good question, Gail. As you very well know, we've seen a improvement in lumber prices that's \u2013 so let me say it this way, the overall trend in lumber prices that we've seen, we think has ultimately been driven by supply and demand. And that's due to the fact that inventories are lean and demand continues to be strong. On top of that, we've seen that exacerbated a little bit by the fires over the past few weeks.", "The way I see it, the uncertainty around the SLA has driven the volatility in pricing but the overall pricing trend has been driven by fundamentals of supply and demand. As the countervailing duty goes off in August, I think we'll continue to see volatility in pricing as that happens. Exactly how that will play out, we'll just have to wait and see, but again encouraged by the underlying supply and demand dynamics. And we're just going to have to see how the SLA plays out going forward and specifically what impact that has at the end of August when the CVD lapses for a short period of time.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research", "All right, thank you. And can you give a little bit of perspective, I guess Southern Yellow Pine was weaker than SPF, and just how you see that relationship building over the next couple quarters?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah, so you're exactly right, those kind of got out of sync during the quarter. I think there were a number of drivers of that, part of it was the duties that have come into place, part of it was FX, and with the Canadian dollar strengthening versus the U.S. dollar. And then of course the fires that have impacted BC over the past few weeks. So I think all of those things resulted in the relative change in SPF to Southern Yellow Pine. I think going forward, you'll see the normal gap that we've normally seen between those come back to normal as those factors play out.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research", "All right. And just to go to the guidance, you mentioned, I think, that you expected a little bit of improvement in Japanese log prices in 3Q, is that correct? And I'm just curious because I thought log volumes showed a little bit of pressure in June. I'm just wondering if you could give a little more color on the competitive dynamics you're seeing in Japan?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Sure, and as we said in our comments, we continue to be encouraged by what we see overall in Western log markets, and domestic markets demand continues to be strong, primarily driven by what we've seen in the California market. In Japan specifically, to your point, post-and-beam construction continues to grow at about 4%. And in the third quarter, we do anticipate kind of steady demand and potentially slightly higher prices in the third quarter. So, that's how we see Japan. And then China, as you know, inventory continues to be in very good shape, 3.5 million cubic meters, and there we expect higher volume and slightly higher prices in the third quarter as well. That's how we see the export markets.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research", "Okay. One just really quickly one. You mentioned that you're doing one just really quick one. You mentioned that you're doing weekly deliveries to a customer in the China out of the South, is that cannibalizing the business that you have from the West at all?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Business out of the West is very strong right now, as I just indicated, and in fact, total log imports into China from the U.S. are up 35% year-to-date. So, the amount that we are sending into China is an existing customer, but it's both a growth in overall volume as well as displacing a little bit out of the West. But we're fine with displacing a little bit out of the West based on the strong markets that we see in China.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Good morning. Wanted to follow up a little bit on the change in the dividend policy and the tying to Southern saw log pricing over the long-term. Should we understand by that that there could be modest or moderate increases in the divided prior to the recovery in Southern saw log pricing? And then you can get bigger ones when there is visibility on that recovery or is it that there really likely wouldn't be any dividend increases until you saw that recovery?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Mark, as we've said, the board's going to continue to review the dividend. It's going to consider all conditions, external market conditions as well as internal improvements and things we're doing. As you very well know, our largest asset is our Southern Timberlands, and very purposeful, we've said we expect the biggest driver for a substantial dividend increase will be improving pricing for Southern saw logs. Because that's what's going to ultimately generate a sustainable and growing earnings stream that would provide additional strong support for the dividend over time. So that's the way we're looking at it and the board is looking at it.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And I realize this is a really tough one. But do you have any \u2013 what's your perspective on the potential timing of that recovery in Southern saw timber pricing now versus where your thought process would have been previously? And what drivers are \u2013 are there any meaningfully different drivers? And I realize you addressed this in some of your preliminary comments, but any additional color you could give would be welcomed.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Sure, Mark. And we continue to expect improvement in Southern saw log pricing as we move forward for all the reasons that I highlighted. Housing demand continuing to grow, we're encouraged by what we see there. Continued investment in the South and even yesterday or whatever it was, the announcement of a acquisition by one of our Canadian friends in the South and believe that they will spend additional capital to ramp up production there.", "We'll see whether we get a quota or the duties stay in place, but that's going to be helpful. And then, again on the margin, we talked about in the export market. So hard to tell exactly when, but we think as we move into 2018 as housing starts grow to north of 1.3 million, that we could reach the inflection point where we start to see some improvement in Southern saw log prices.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just lastly, curious why do you prefer quotas over duties?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "So, Mark, the reason we like the quotas versus the duties, is it's simple, it's effective, and we think it'll allow the U.S. industry to grow to its natural size. Now, with that said, if we can't get the right agreement in place, we can make the duties work as well. But we just like the certainty of having a duty in place. Everybody understands exactly what that is, and then go forward based on that.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning, Doyle, good morning, Russell.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Mark.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Doyle, let's just come back to that Softwood Lumber Agreement one more time. I'm just curious, if we don't get a deal in the next few weeks, and then we're in a point where we've reopened these NAFTA negotiations, is that going to kind of preclude getting a deal done on lumber until NAFTA is redone?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Mark, it's hard to answer that question, because we don't know exactly how that's going to play out. I do think if the SLA gets drug into NAFTA that could prolong our ability to reach a negotiated agreement, but there's just a lot of uncertainty exactly how the SLA will interplay with NAFTA at this point.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "You have a guess on your side? I mean, I think we're all kind of scratching our head.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "I don't. Yeah, and I wish I could provide more clarity, Mark, but we're kind of scratching our head too just because it's just an unknown.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. The second question I had, Doyle, I know you guys have been very focused on kind of integrating Plum Creek. I'm curious as to whether you think you're at a point where you might start to look at some meaningful acquisitions. There is a lot of timberland that's potentially in the market over the next year or two.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Mark, as we've consistently said, our priorities number one, two and three have been the integration of Plum Creek. We've made very good progress on that, and I'm pleased with where we are. As we move forward, we would potentially look at timberland acquisitions but, as we've also said, the beauty of our portfolio is we are very well positioned and we don't have to grow anywhere. So with that said, we can be very, very disciplined in looking at potential timberlands acquisitions. If we find opportunities that we think will drive shareholder value, that's something we would consider. Otherwise, we'll just continue to focus on what we can do internally to continue to drive improvements in our overall performance and shareholder value.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "All right. That's fair. Last question I had, Doyle. Just any more color on options around fireproofing on the I-joists, the thing that I think Flak Jacket was an attempt to deal with?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Mark, right now \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Well, I was just going to say, and I'd also like to get a sense if I could about how big, how many markets that that really is an issue in right now, because I think a lot of this is state-by-state regulation?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "It is state-by-state regulation, Mark. And our focus right now, as you would anticipate, is making sure we're doing everything we can with our customers to resolve the situation with Flak Jacket. As we move forward, we'll be determining how we want to proceed on any future product that would have this fire retardant material.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay, fair enough. Good luck in the second half of the year, Doyle.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please go ahead.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hi, good morning, Doyle.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Chip.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yeah, I had a question just on \u2013 first question is, a few weeks ago, we saw that one of the large privately held wood products companies is announcing an engineered wood facility in South Carolina. And I know you've seen a great improvement in your results in that business, but my perception is that's mostly internally driven, not really market driven. So what are your thoughts about that? Do you think the market can handle that addition to capacity?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "You know, Chip, and thanks for making your comment on the internal improvements and clearly part of the improved performance in WP has been internal improvements. But with that said, those markets are also improving. As you very well know, we put in a price increase. That was in February. We saw a significant benefit of that in second quarter. We'll see a little bit more benefit from that in the third quarter. And I just give that background to say as housing continues to improve, we as an industry will need some additional capacity.", "Now, how that matches up when this mill comes online and it will take a while to get this mill online. As you very well know, startup takes a while. How that meshes with where we are exactly on housing starts remains to be seen, but as housing continues to improve and gets to 1.4 million, 1.5 million, 1.6 million, whatever the number is, there will be additional capacity that will be needed in engineered wood products.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And I don't know, either you or Russell, what are your thoughts about the \u2013 you mentioned that obviously the board is going to think about how to approach the dividend in terms of the ongoing rate. But you know it's interesting, obviously the saw timber tie-in in the South makes total sense because saw timber prices of course tend to be a lot more stable than wood products. But you still have this great Wood Products business that's doing very well. Now, I know other companies, one specifically for years has practiced sort of a variable dividend. And then there is another one who yesterday said that they are considering that, just because that is obviously more appropriate given the volatility you have there. Would that be something that you personally would consider or recommend to the board as an override to the ongoing quarterly dividend in years or periods where the wood business is particularly strong?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah, this is Russell. As Doyle said, our objective is a growing and sustainable dividend over time. Clearly, the Wood Products business is performing well. We are pinned on Southern saw log as being the catalyst. However, we would take into consideration depending on where the market is at, but our primary focus is growing a steady dividend over time.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Got you. Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A.D. [D.A. Davidson] Please go ahead.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks, good morning.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "I recognize it was a wet spring here in the West, but it sure has been hot and dry in the last month, so are any of your Western lands now operating under harvest restrictions? And is that incorporated into your Timberlands guidance?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "It's a good question, and you're right, it was a very wet spring and now, at least where we live, we haven't seen rain in a month or so. So, at this point in terms of Washington and Oregon, nothing is under a fire restriction at this point in time, but as we all know, that could change quickly as we move forward. So basically, what's incorporated, Steve, in our guidance is kind of what I would call a normal fire season, if there is such a thing. If that changes, you could see further restriction or further tightening, I would say, of log markets in the Pacific Northwest. I would mention in Montana, we do have restrictions in place and no logging at this point in time is allowed after 1 PM.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Yeah, I kind of thought we might be going to Hoot here soon. Okay.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thank you very much.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "It very well could happen.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of James Armstrong with Armstrong Investments. Please go ahead.", "James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research", "Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning.", "James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research", "The first question I have is as land sales pick up in the back half of the year, will there be much change in the mix or will realizations per acre be similar to the first half of the year? Just I noticed that realizations were up nicely in the first half.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "James, this is Russell. As Doyle mentioned, we completed the Western analysis for our AVO or asset value optimization. And we're very pleased with those results and so we'll see some of those acres coming into the market in the second half of the year. As we indicated, third quarter will be double second and then we'll see a ramp-up in the fourth quarter. Those properties will have a higher value than the Southern or the Northern properties. So you may see a change in the average per acre value coming through the program.", "James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research", "Okay, that helps. And then on EWP, switching gears, you mentioned that you had more price realization in the second quarter than you expected, could you comment on how much you expect to get remaining in the third quarter? And will that be it for the February price increase or will some bleed into the fourth quarter?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah, so in the second quarter, we realized about 70% of the price increase which, as we mentioned, was higher than we originally anticipated. In the third quarter, we would anticipate an additional 20% and then the balance, the 10%, to show up in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of how we see it playing out.", "James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research", "Perfect. Thank you very much.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Just following up on the use of cash line of questions. Looks like you have a balance sheet that's up to about $700 million of cash, and you should get some proceeds from the Uruguay sale soon. Just wondering how share repurchases might fit into the capital reallocation strategy? And as you're contemplating where to move the dividend in a sustainable way, if share repurchases could be a solution to \u2013 a little bit of a release valve for some of that cash that's building up on the balance sheet?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Sure. And as we've consistently said in terms of our priorities for capital allocation, first and foremost is returning cash to shareholders. That'll be primarily through a growing and sustainable dividend. But Brian, as we've indicated, we're also open to share repurchase where appropriate and, as you know, we currently have a authorization of $500 million in terms of share repurchase.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And then one \u2013 I see you chose to exclude the $11 million duties from the Wood Products adjusted EBITDA. I just wonder in the thought process there, if you guys are viewing that as a one-time thing in nature, maybe because they'll lapse at the end of August or they'll eventually be replaced by a quota? And then maybe could you clarify, is that $11 million tied to the actual lumber sales in the quarter or was there some impact from 1Q sales due to the retroactive nature of the duties?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "So, Brian you're \u2013 this is Russell \u2013 correct, we did put that as a special item and there's two components. One is the retroactive countervailing duties and then the go-forward countervailing and antidumping duties. And so we do view those as pretty unique relative to the overall lumber operations and that's why we put it in the special items. And then you're correct, it will drop off in August 28, until there is an actual final determination and then the duties are reinstated. So it'll be a little lumpy coming through if we put it into the operations.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And if we were to think about what an actual, theoretically if the duties did stay at the current levels, and actual expense in the quarter would have been something closer to $6 million or $7 million instead of the $11 million?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah, probably $6 million to $7 million.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And the one last one from me, we've seen a big move in the Canadian dollar in the last couple of weeks and months. Could you remind us the impact to your earnings, every $0.01 or so move in the $1 might have? And then thinking beyond just the translation impact, any impact you might expect on trade flows from that? And historically have you seen Canadian imports of lumber dry up a little bit and a little bit more production shift to the U.S. when this has happened?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah, we noted that the change in the relationship on the FX for the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, but we've been operating in a relatively strong dollar environment and we don't really see material impacts on those interquarter shifts. So we really don't look at what is the impact on a per $0.01 shift on that. So we don't think there'll be a material change in the inflows, it'll really be a primarily driven by the SLA and then also some of the restrictions resulting from fires up in Canada.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Yeah, thanks very much. Morning, Russell and morning, Doyle.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Paul.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Morning, Paul.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Just thanks for the updated pay-out ratio that you targeted $0.85, I understand the catalyst is on Southern log price movement. Just on that question, we had a lot of deferrals in the U.S. South following the recession in 2008 to probably 2014, just wondering what your assessment is of the current growth versus drain in the overall South? Are we harvesting more than the trees are growing down there, and when do you think we'll start to see some tension in the market?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Paul this is Russell. As we look in the South, again as Doyle mentioned, with continued strength in the housing market and continued increase in production, we're definitely seeing some rebalancing in some wood baskets. And I expect that as we continue to see the housing market recover and less Canadian volume coming into the U.S. market, we'll see those pensioned (44:22) over time. But it's not consistent across the entire South, but we're definitely seeing some benefits, particularly in the Atlantic South where those markets are starting to tension.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then just on the guidance, when you guys for Q3 when you're guiding for Timberlands to be slightly down, is that like a 5% number and then one of the things that surprised me was the lower fee harvest volumes expected in the West and what's the result of that?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "So, in terms of the guidance we said slightly so I would say that 5% or less in terms of what that would mean in terms of dollars. And then in terms of the lower harvest in the West that's primarily due just to timing. As you know, a lot of what we call farmer wood comes on the market in the quarter, which can have a negative impact on pricing. We tend to back off during that period of time and then capitalize when pricing tends to be a little bit better.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, just on this potential Softwood Lumber deal, I'm pretty aware what happens in Canada on this side. Just it seems like a black box in terms of the Coalition's acceptance of the deal. Maybe you could give us some broad strokes, is that a two-thirds vote requirement and is that on a volume weighted basis for lumber producers in the U.S.?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "So, Paul, what I would tell you is the Lumber Coalition continues to be very united in terms of the approach on the Softwood Lumber Agreement, and is united behind, as we mentioned earlier, a quota-based agreement. So, I think if a deal can be negotiated that works for both sides, that's something that the U.S. Lumber Coalition would in fact support.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "All right. That's all I had. Best of luck.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with the Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, George.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "How're you doing? If I had one last quick one on SLA, recognizing that it might not be something you really want to get into. But just for the record, what do you think the odds are that, as there has been some speculation, that there might be an agreement before the NAFTA discussions begin middle of next month. And to the extent that you can comment at all, has there been a significant narrowing in your view of the bid-ask spread in terms of the quotas that both sides have seemingly wanted to apply?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "George, as you know, there have been a lot of discussions and negotiations between the parties, and what I would tell you is we do in fact remain hopeful that some type of framework can be agreed on before we get into this NAFTA issue. Trying handicap it would be just pure speculation. But again, we do remain hopeful, and we think some progress has been made.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. No, Doyle, that's actually quite helpful. Thank you for that. Russell, quick one for you. Remind me the basis for the land sales the rest of the year, what should we be modeling for, for the segment?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "George, I'd say the basis is probably 40% to 50% for the full year.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then, back to the question of supply coming into the market, and recognizing, one, that it's ultimately good for the Timberlands business and hopefully the Southern business in terms of saw log pricing, and pulpwood pricing, and then also that your view is going to be ultimately that housing growth will absorb the capacity coming on.", "There has been a lot of capacity announced, as mentioned earlier, you have the EWP facility going up in Southern Carolina. You have the lumber projects in South Carolina and Northern Carolina, Florida, and you have an OSB announcement of a restart, I think today. Which of those markets do you feel have the most ability to absorb the oncoming capacity? And which would give you maybe a little bit of caution in terms of the absorption rate, at least initially, and why and why not? Thank you, guys, and good luck in the quarter.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, George. And what I would tell you is going from the ones I think have the most ability to absorb to where it may be a little lumpier in terms of absorption, I would say first is lumber. I think this additional lumber capacity is going to be needed and it's going to be absorbed without significant disruptions or potentially any disruption to the market. EWP, I talked about. We talked about it a little bit earlier, and we think as housing continues to grow, additional EWP capacity is going to be required and that capacity that's been announced is still quite a bit out in terms of when that will come online.", "And then finally OSB. As we know, OSB tends to come on in big chunks and I think clearly we need additional capacity, the industry probably needs additional capacity as OSB markets are tight and housing continues to grow. And we'll just have to see how that production phases in. One thing I would note is new mills, it always takes longer to start them up than most people factor in. And then some of these are restarts of mills that have been down for a very extended period of time. It will take some time to ramp those up as well. So that's how we think about the additional capacity that's slated to come online.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then on that latter point, Doyle, you'd say six months to a year in terms of the startup curve for an OSB mill restarting?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "That's probably as good as any, George.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "I'd just like to close by thanking everyone for joining us this morning and, as always, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Weyerhaeuser second quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Elizabeth L. Baum - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2016 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.", "On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Beth, and welcome everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $70 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $150 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Our first quarter earnings included results from Plum Creek for the period February 19 through March 31.", "Special items for the first quarter included integration and restructuring charges related to the Plum Creek merger and a strategic review of our Cellulose Fiber business, partially offset by gain on the sale of our corporate campus.", "I'm extremely proud of the work of our employees in the quarter, as we closed the Plum Creek merger, delivered solid operating performance across each of our businesses, and took significant steps toward achieving the commitments that will drive long-term value for shareholders of our merged company including \u2013 we have specific plans in place to capture $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies, and I am highly confident that we will meet or exceed this run rate target by the end of year one. As part of that, we made and announced nearly all our personnel decisions in the 41 days between merger close and the end of the first quarter.", "We raised $2.5 billion of attractively priced term loan financing and began to aggressively execute against our $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had repurchased approximately $860 million or 35% of our authorization at an average price of $27.49 per share, and we close the sale of our corporate campus for $70 million in cash with our move to Seattle on track and scheduled for September.", "We have continued to execute against our goals as the second quarter has progressed. On April 1, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction announced by Plum Creek in September 2015, receiving $440 million in cash in a transaction that valued 260,000 acres of Plum Creek Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. As of the end of April, our share repurchase program was 50% complete with cumulative repurchases of $1.25 billion or nearly 44 million shares at an average price of $28.62.", "And finally, earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of a portion of our Cellulose Fibers business strategic review with the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper for $2.2 billion.", "I will turn now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by a continuing job growth and historically low interest rates.", "As of March, total housing starts had improved 14% year-to-date compared with 2015. Single-family starts have grown even more and are up 23% year-to-date. Although multi-family activity, which is typically more volatile, has driven some choppiness in monthly indicators, first quarter housing activity has been consistent with our expectations and those of our customers. Despite some headwinds from labor constraints, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. We continue to plan for just over 1.2 million housing starts in 2016.", "Let me now turn to our business segments. Following the merger, we realigned our management structure and our business segments to incorporate the increased scale of our Timberlands operations, as well as the addition of Plum Creek's real estate, energy, and natural resources expertise. For the first quarter, Weyerhaeuser is reporting four business segments: Timberlands; Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources; Wood Products; and Cellulose Fibers.", "To make it easier to compare current and historical results, business segment results for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect our new segment definitions. We've also revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to add back the non-cash basis of real estate sold. With this change, EBITDA for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment will better reflect the cash generated by those activities. Going forward, we will focus on adjusted EBITDA for all our businesses.", "I will now begin the discussion, Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. In Timberlands, we're reporting EBITDA by three primary geographies, Western Timberlands includes Washington and Oregon; Southern Timberlands includes all Southern states; and Northern Timberlands includes operations in Montana, the Lake States, New England, and West Virginia.", "Results from Canada and Uruguay are reported in other Timberlands. Recreational lease activities continues to be reported within the Timberlands segment and volumes and realizations for our Timberlands business are now reported in tons.", "Timberlands contributed $129 million to first quarter earnings, an improvement of $22 million compared with the fourth quarter. These results include a higher non-cash depletion and amortization costs due to the step-up in Timberlands basis associated with acquisition accounting and the alignment of our accounting policies.", "Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $39 million to $199 million. Approximately, 12% of Timberlands first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations. Western Timberlands contributed $118 million to first quarter EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million compared with the fourth quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased due to slightly higher harvest for legacy Weyerhaeuser land and a partial quarter of Plum Creek harvest.", "Average realizations for Western logs declined slightly due to a shift in mix from export to domestic markets. Average realizations for export logs improved and export sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. Sales volumes to Japan increased and pricing improved modestly due to continued strong demand. Japanese wooden housing starts have improved slightly compared with 2015 as mortgage rates remained low and we see some pull forward in advance of a scheduled increased in the consumption tax next year. Volumes to China declined seasonally compared with fourth quarter as construction activity paused during the Lunar New Year period. Average realizations improved slightly.", "Log inventory to Chinese ports rose during the first quarter, but remained within a normal range for the season and well below the elevated levels experienced during the first quarter of 2015. With inventories in line and slightly improved construction activity, our customers are optimistic regarding current market conditions. In Western domestic market, log supply and demand remained balanced and realizations improved slightly.", "Southern Timberland contributed $77 million to first quarter EBITDA, $21 million more than the fourth quarter. This improvement was attributable to a partial quarter of Plum Creek operations. A partial quarter of harvest from Plum Creek's 3.4 million Southern acres increased Southern harvest by 40% and more than offset a small seasonal decline in harvest from legacy Weyerhaeuser land.", "Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly primarily due to mix. Silviculture costs and forestry costs declined as activity was delayed due to wet weather. A partial quarter of results from Plum Creek's Northern Timberlands contributed $3 million to first quarter EBITDA.", "Operational excellence initiatives continue to contribute to Timberlands' results. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we set a target of $20 million of $30 million of OpEx improvements from legacy Weyerhaeuser Holdings. Following the merger, we have now increased the Timberlands' 2016 OpEx target to $30 million to $50 million to incorporate $10 million to $20 million of operational synergies we expect to achieve from the merger this year.", "The multi-year OpEx targets for Timberlands has also increased to $200 million, including the $64 million achieved in 2014 and 2015 to incorporate operational synergy opportunity from the merger. Timberlands has begun an internal benchmarking exercise to identify best practices in silviculture, logging and transportation, and leverage those learnings across the entire Timberlands portfolio. Although this work is still in the early stages, I'm pleased by the level of energy and teamwork in identifying opportunities across the business.", "Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, chart 6 and 7. The Real Estate & ENR segment includes sales of HBU and non-core Timberland property as well as lease and royalty income from minerals, aggregates, and oil and gas. These activities were formerly reported within Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands segment. Real Estate & ENR contributed $15 million to first quarter earnings, $12 million lower than the fourth quarter. However, EBITDA increased by $1 million to $34 million as lower EBITDA from legacy Weyerhaeuser operations was more than offset by a partial quarter of Plum Creek results. Total acreage sold increased in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter due to a conservation sale of over 8,000 acres of Maine timberlands.", "Although a partial quarter of Plum Creek's operations contributed significantly to the segment's EBITDA, the Plum Creek contribution to earnings was minimal because Plum Creek land was marked up to fair value as part of the merger purchase price allocation.", "Operational excellence for the Real Estate & ENR business will be based on the premium to Timberland values captured from the sale of HBU properties. The first step in defining the size of this opportunity is applying Plum Creek's asset value optimization, or AVO, process across Weyerhaeuser's 6.9 million acres of legacy Timberlands. This process is underway and we anticipate it will be substantially complete in about one year.", "Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $87 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $48 million in the fourth quarter. Results for Plum Creek lumber mills are reported as part of the lumber business and results for Plum Creek's plywood and medium density fiberboard, or MDF, facilities are reported with Engineered Wood Products.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the Wood Products segment increased to $117 million, primarily due to improved unit manufacturing costs and seasonally higher sales volume. Approximately 4% of Wood Products' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations.", "In lumber, EBITDA improved $18 million compared with fourth quarter. Average realizations improved 1% and sales volumes increased 3%. Unit manufacturing costs declined due to higher operating rates and strong operating performance. Fourth quarter included downtime for installation of capital projects.", "In OSB, EBITDA increased to $31 million, $6 million higher than the fourth quarter and $27 million higher than the first quarter of last year. Unit manufacturing costs improved due to strong operating performance and reduced downtime for planned maintenance. This more than offset a 3% decrease in average sales realizations. Sales volumes increased 5%.", "Engineered Wood Products' EBITDA more than doubled to $31 million, compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter. Operating rates and unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher demand, strong operating performance, and reduced downtime for maintenance and capital projects. Sales volumes increased seasonally and average realizations declined slightly due to mix.", "EBITDA for the Distribution business improved to $4 million, $2 million more than the fourth quarter and $7 million more than the first quarter of 2015. This business benefited from improved margins and lower operating cost. Operational excellence continues to contribute to Wood Products results as all four businesses gain leverage from ongoing improvements in controllable cost. The businesses are collectively targeting $55 million to $75 million of operational excellence improvements in 2016. Each business remains relentlessly focused on its initiatives and is on track to achieve its target.", "Cellulose Fibers, charts 10 and 11. Cellulose Fibers contributed $28 million to first quarter earnings, compared with earnings before special items of $64 million in the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging declined as prices remained under pressure. Sales volumes declined only slightly as demand for our pulp remained strong despite the seasonally weak Lunar New Year period. Maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. First quarter included 16 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with eight days in the fourth quarter.", "As I noted earlier, we have announced the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper in a $2.2 billion cash transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review, and we expect it to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction delivers compelling value for our shareholders and we expect to use a substantial portion of the $1.6 billion after-tax proceeds for repayment of the 18-month term loans raised during the first quarter.", "I want to thank the employees of our Cellulose Fibers business for their dedication and professionalism as they have continued to operate safely and deliver an exceptional customer experience through the strategic review process.", "As noted in Monday's press release, the strategic review of our liquid packaging business and newsprint and publication venture is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete.", "I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. Starting with Timberlands, we expect second quarter EBITDA to come in approximately 10% higher than first quarter with second quarter earnings comparable to the first quarter.", "It is important to note that as part of the purchase price allocation, the Plum Creek Timberlands basis was stepped up to reflect fair value. As a result, new depletion rates were established for the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek Timberlands. In addition to changes in the depletion rate, the accounting policies for amortization of road and other related expenses have been aligned. These changes will result in total amortization and depletion expense of approximately $90 million for the second quarter.", "In our Western Timberlands operations, log export volume is expected to improve in the second quarter as volumes to China increased following the seasonally low Lunar New Year period. Japanese export volumes were elevated in the first quarter and are expected to return to more normal seasonal levels in the second quarter. We anticipate stable pricing for our Japanese and Chinese export logs with a slight decline in overall export price realizations due to the higher proportion of Chinese volume. Domestic log volumes will increase with the addition of the Plum Creek activity with prices remain stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs will be higher due to shifting harvest activity to higher elevation, which is typical during the spring season.", "In the South, harvest volumes will increase approximately 40% as we benefit from the full quarter of Plum Creek operations. We expect average log prices will decrease modestly as the harvest mix will include a higher proportion of pulpwood logs. In addition, forestry expenses will be higher due to increased seasonal spending.", "In the North, harvest volumes will be above the first quarter levels with the inclusion of a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. The second quarter typically has the lowest harvest levels of the year because of spring weather conditions with the mud season, which limits access to harvest sites in the Northern operating region. Average sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter levels. Note, that prior to the merger, Plum Creek included their Oregon and Washington activity in their Northern segment.", "Moving on to our full year Timber harvest outlook. We expect our combined 2016 fee harvest will be 40 million to 42 million tons. The 2016 fee harvest is comparable to the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek 2015 harvest levels after adding Plum Creek's harvest for the January 1 to February 19 pre-merger period.", "Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources' second quarter EBITDA and earnings are expected to be similar to the first quarter. Higher and better use markets remain active in the Southern states and we expect similar transaction activity in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter.", "In the second half of the year, we expect transaction counts to increase as more higher and better use properties are identified through our AVO process and brought to market. For the remainder of the year, we estimate the sales mix will be evenly split between Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek lands, with an average basis of 50%.", "For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain relatively low, as buyers continue to meet their purchasing needs on a just-in-time basis. Prices for lumber have improved in the second half of the first quarter, and that trend continued into the second quarter. Average April sales realizations were $30 higher than the first quarter average. OSB prices have also rallied, with average April sales realizations approximately $15 higher than the first quarter averages. We anticipate prices will continue to strengthen during the second quarter, as building activity increases.", "Sales volume for the Engineered Wood Products are expected to be seasonally higher in the second quarter, and we expect continued improvement in this business. Operating rates remain strong across all the Wood Products business lines. We expect overall second quarter EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be significantly higher than the first quarter. In fact, EBITDA for this segment has not been this strong since the second quarter of 2013. This is primarily a result of our improved operational performance and competitive cost structure.", "Moving to Cellulose Fibers, EBITDA and earnings in Cellulose Fibers business were expected to increase during the second quarter with higher average sales realizations across our product lines. Volumes are expected to be similar to first quarter levels. We anticipate maintenance spending to be similar to first quarter. Other cost of sales are expected to decrease slightly due to lower fiber and energy costs.", "For our key financial items, cash from operations during the first quarter was $47 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonally lower earnings, inventory buildup, and semi-annual interest payments.", "We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $415 million. Going forward, we anticipate that our normalized cash balance will be in the range of $200 million to $400 million, which we feel is an appropriate level for the capital structure at this time. We completed our planned post-transaction financing in February and March by entering into two 18-month term loans at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 105 basis points or approximately 1.5%. The loans have a total capacity of $2.5 billion.", "At the end of the quarter, we had drawn down $1.1 billion. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.1 billion, was $6.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We have no debt maturities in 2016 and we intend to pay down the new term loans primarily with proceeds from asset sales. This will allow us to move toward our target debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times.", "Interest expense for the first quarter reflects a partial quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. Looking forward, our 2016 interest expense will be approximately $450 million for the year.", "Moving on to capital expenditures, first quarter capital expenditures totaled $73 million. Our capital spending is seasonal and tends to be lowest in the first quarter before ramping up through the rest of the year. We continue to expect 2016 CapEx will be approximately $450 million, excluding Cellulose Fibers. This includes minimal spending for Real Estate and Energy and Natural resources where the focus is on entitlement and royalty contracts and not capital-intensive development.", "Our 2016 total company tax rate would be dependent upon the mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. We are currently estimating our full year total company tax rate to be approximately 18% to 20%. Due to prior year overpayment, we do not anticipate making a cash payment in 2016. These first quarter estimates do not take into account the impact of the divestiture of the pulp business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "Let me direct your attention to chart 12, which details the major components of our unallocated items. Income before special items improved to $19 million in the first quarter compared with $1 million of expense in fourth quarter of 2015. Improvement was driven primarily by foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar strengthened 7% against the U.S. dollar during the quarter.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Russell. I will close my comments this morning with some brief comments on the merger integration process. Two-and-a-half months after day one, we have made solid progress on merger integration. Our merged corporate area team is operating together out of our building in Federal Way and we have begun the consolidation of regional offices. Each of our senior management team members has spent several weeks on the road meeting with employees and reinforcing our vision and the core values, relentless focus, and key behaviors that will define our success as a merged company.", "I look forward to building on that strong foundation as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company. We are relentlessly focused on improving performance through operational excellence and capturing cost and operational synergies to leverage the full benefit of an improving U.S. housing market and drive long-term value to our shareholders.", "And now, we like to open up the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Plum Creek typically gave guidance on annual revenue from the Real Estate business and I was wondering if you would continue that, if you had any thoughts on sales or EBITDA contribution in 2016. And then from your comments earlier, is it safe to say you'd expect Real Estate sales to step-up in 2017 as you apply that AVO methodology to Weyerhaeuser's portfolio?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Anthony, as we indicated, we are right in the middle of applying the AVO process across the entire legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberland base. And as Russell mentioned, we anticipate that activity will ramp-up in the second half of 2016 and into 2017 as you mentioned. As we get a better feel for what those numbers are going to look like, we will provide guidance as we have historically on a quarterly basis to let you know what we think those will look like going forward. But we're excited about the process. We think there's lots of opportunity, and that activity, as I said, will ramp-up in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. And then switching to lumber, prices have been much stronger than we expected year-to-date. And I was wondering if you could give us some sense of what's happening on the ground in terms of demand you're seeing at job sites, how tight inventories are. And I think typically we see a little seasonal weakness in the second quarter. And I think in your comments, you referenced continued strengthening. So, what's driving your confidence there and maybe what's different from previous years?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in lumber and the price increases that have taken place to-date, Anthony. I think the key drivers are just improvement in demand, and as I highlighted, especially in single-family housing has been a big part of it. And then the other part, and Russell mentioned this, is just the low inventory levels across the system. So, what we've seen is average prices for April, $30 above first quarter average, and current prices are $10 above the April average, so it has continued to go up. And as we said based on the low inventories, the strong demand, we are very encouraged by what we've seen on the ground in terms of lumber demand and the opportunity for pricing going forward.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on the outlook for Wood Products, you talked about 2Q EBITDA being significantly higher than 1Q. Is there any way you can put a finer point on that or quantify that versus previous years?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Russell mentioned it, you can go back to second quarter of 2013 as kind of a comparable period. The reason \u2013 the other thing, Anthony, and the reason we laid out the price and the detail that we did, you, of course, know the leverage. But in terms of, on an annual basis, every $10 increase in lumber is $40 million on an annual basis. Every $10 increase in OSB is $30 million on an annual basis. I should mention that we talked about lumber, but OSB prices have continued to improve as well, and current prices are up another $7 versus the April average in OSB. So, we try to provide you the leverage that we have to pricing, and I'll tell you on top of that, as you saw in the first quarter results, our Wood Products business is running, operating really well. And we anticipate that's going to continue as we move through the quarter.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Collin.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "First question for me. Just as far as acquisition opportunities from here, Doyle, can you maybe just touch on the final terms with the Twin Creeks JV? And, obviously, we've seen a few larger Timberland deals here announced in the last few weeks. Maybe just your take on the current acquisition environment.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, let me comment on the current acquisition environment and then I'll ask Russell to comment on Twin Creeks. So, in terms of the current acquisition environment, there continues to be a lot of interest in this asset class and, frankly, a lot of money chasing deals. As we've seen announced recently, there have been some deals that are happening. I would highlight on the West some transaction announced at $4,300 an acre and then in the South, of course, our Twin Creeks transaction at $2,150 an acre, and then I think I saw just last night CatchMark announced something at $2,000 an acre. So, I would tell you, as I've said, a lot of increased activity, a lot of interest in the asset class. And I would say, good values being paid for high-quality property.", "And, now, let me turn it over to Russell to comment on Twin Creeks.", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, Collin, as we announced, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction on April 1. And that was a deal that was put together prior to the merger, obviously. And we delayed the close so that we could sit down with the investors and make sure that we'd structured it appropriately, given Weyerhaeuser's differences to Plum Creek.", "So, the real key items are, the property management agreement under the Plum Creek structure was 15 years. We've shortened that to three years under the Weyerhaeuser, as amended. And then the equity ownership dropped from 25% to 21%. Those are probably the two biggest items that changed in the transaction.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just, Russell, remind us on what can Weyerhaeuser buy for its balance sheet versus what has to have a first right of refusal to the JV?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Right. So, the acquisition right of first refusal is anything under $10 million, Weyerhaeuser can buy on its account. And that's primarily because those would probably be properties that are more adjacent to operations. Anything in between $10 million and $200 million first goes to the joint venture for a period of three years. And so, the remaining $400 million of cash available for acquisitions is completed.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Very helpful. And then I guess, Russell, just \u2013 I wanted \u2013 when the dust settles with the Fibers business and use of proceeds for that. I know in the prepared remarks you're referencing kind of a 3.5 times debt to EBITDA. But are you going to move any of those leverage targets up a little bit given the mix of businesses is going to be a lot more towards timber and less towards manufacturing capacity or what do you stand on that?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, was your question in relation to leverage ratios?", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yes.", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I would say that right now we're targeting to 3.5 times, we'll continue to move towards that over time. As we've mentioned, we issued short-term debt. We'll use sale of assets to reduce bad debt over time.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just one other follow-up on Anthony's question, just as it relates to the Real Estate business. I think, Doyle, you've suggested in the past may be 15% to 20% of the combined companies could potentially be Real Estate. Is that still how you're thinking about, again recognizing you're still relatively early in that review process? But would that be fair as we start thinking about 2017 to the comment that it's going to step-up materially?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's exactly right, Collin. We are still comfortable with that guidance of 15% to 20%. And as I mentioned, we anticipate real estate activity will ramp-up second half of 2016 and into 2017 to get us to that range. Every year won't be exactly that, but that's kind of a guideline as to what we anticipate the contribution from Real Estate will be on a go-forward basis after we complete the AVO process.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Perfect. Thanks, guys.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Collin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is actually John Babcock standing in for George. Just two quick questions for you. First on the EWP markets. Demand was a little better than we expected, and just wanted to get a little bit of a sense for what you're seeing in the market and ultimately how that might trend for the rest of the year?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, so we were encouraged by the demand in EWP in the quarter. I think that's primarily driven by the increase in single-family starts. As you very well know, that is by far the biggest driver of demand for EWP and with single-family starts being up 23% in the first quarter, that flowed through to our EWP business. And again, optimistic that housing is going to continue to improve, including an improvement in single-family starts, so that should bode well for EWP for the balance of the year.", "John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then secondly, just as the \u2013 with regards to the merger as a whole, as that gets under way, ultimately how do you expect that to impact the pace and trajectory of the operating improvements that you're targeting for the business?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, the key there, of course, is the OpEx targets for Timberland. And as we mentioned, we have raised those targets significantly. In 2016, the original target pre-merger was $20 million to $30 million for Timberlands. We have now raised that to $30 million to $50 million for 2016 to identify the early opportunities to deliver operational synergies, which are, of course, above the cost synergies.", "More importantly than that, though, we raised the multi-year target to $200 million. So that's an incremental $130 million above what we received \u2013 what we accomplished in 2014 and 2015. So, an additional $130 million that we think we will be able to accomplish over the next two to three years, as we put these two companies together and deliver bottom-line operational synergies. So, really excited about that opportunity. A lot of work going on currently to do benchmarking of the best of each company and start to identify opportunities to drive those operational synergies to the bottom line. So, excited about that as we move forward.", "John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Okay. Just a quick follow-up there, though. I mean with the merger kind of starting obviously in the first half here, do you expect that \u2013 the improvements for this year to be kind of back-weighted?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, let's talk about the two components just to be clear. So, there's cost synergies and then there's operational synergies. In terms of the cost synergies, as I've said, these are hard dollar cost synergies, as I've said in my remarks, we are highly confident that we'll meet or exceed the $100 million run rate that we laid out as a target. I'll tell you that will be somewhat lumpy, but it's not going to be all backend loaded, and we will report out on our progress on that on a quarterly basis as we move forward.", "As with \u2013 in terms of operational synergies, again, $10 million to $20 million additional on top of what we had already identified for Timberlands in 2016. And then I would say kind of as you've seen distributed kind of evenly over the next two or three years to get the balance of the operational synergies that we've identified as part of the merger.", "John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot, Doyle.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thanks. Doyle, do you have much visibility into the split of export log business for the year between Japan and China? You talked about seasonality, so I'm kind of hoping you can give some sense of what you think the whole year might look like?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would think the whole year, Mark, will be in line with kind of what we've seen historically. But let me give you just a little bit of color on what we're seeing in each of those markets currently. And then if that doesn't answer your question, we'll come back to it. But in terms of Japan, as we talked about, volume and pricing were both up in the first quarter. We think \u2013 and a little bit of that was pull forward for people being ready for an anticipated run up before the consumption tax increase. In the second quarter we think demand, because it was elevated in the first quarter, will be down a little bit in the second quarter and price will be down, flat to down slightly.", "China, encouraged about what's happening there. As you know, the inventories didn't build like they have over the last couple of years in the first quarter, so we anticipate both demand and pricing will be up in the second quarter. And then domestic, as we said, good demand, probably a little bit slightly lower prices in the second quarter. So, as you know in the slides, we break out the percentage of Japan versus China and Korea, and we wouldn't see any significant changes there as we move forward, although in the second quarter, we will anticipate as I just highlighted, China being a larger component. And maybe that continues for the balance of the year if China continues to accelerate in terms of demand like we've seen in the first and going into the second quarter.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Super. That's really helpful. Can I ask just one more question? Can you remind us how much of your OSB is currently going into your EWP business?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mark, we're going to get back with you with that exact number. It's a small part of it, but I just don't know that number exactly off the top of my head, but we'll get back with you.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. Just a couple follow-ups first. On the \u2013 just want to make sure I understand, so the cost synergy is the $100 million. Where will that be showing up? Will that be presumably in the various segments as well, primarily in Timberlands? But that is separate from the operational synergies? And I think you talked about being $130 million over a couple years. Is that correct?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That is correct, Mark. It will show up in various places, but it'll show up in the segment and then we'll lay out a way for you to track it exactly. But more importantly than that, to your second point, yes, the additional OpEx amount that we've identified for Timberland is above and beyond the hard dollar cost synergies.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Completely different bucket.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And then a second quick follow-up, also you'd mentioned 15% to 20% from real estate sales. Was that a reference to EBITDA? And are we talking kind of $300 million to $350 million or so expectations coming from real estate from an EBITDA perspective? Is that how we should think about that? Or was that a different reference?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. It was an EBITDA reference. And again, once this \u2013 we ramp-up, just general guidelines, 15% to 20% of overall EBITDA for the company would come \u2013 we would anticipate would come from the real estate business. Now, like I said, a lot of work to do and identify all of those opportunities, but just to give \u2013 we wanted to give some guidance of what we thought that number could be on a go-forward basis.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay, and then lastly, just understand kind of the expected pace on the share repurchase. I think you had indicated previously that you anticipated about $2 billion of the $2.5 billion would be done quite quickly \u2013 forget the exact terminology. Now, would you be just continuing to draw down on the term loan to execute on that, and then you pay all of that back when the pulp business gets sold? Is that how to think of it?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, Mark, you're exactly right. What we said is $2 billion of the $2.5 billion we would do on an accelerated basis. And I think we've shown that that's exactly what we're doing. Once that's completed, we'll kind of pause and reevaluate the timing on the additional $500 million. You're right, we'll draw down on the term loan and we will use the asset sales and whatever else; but asset sales in Twin Creeks, whatever, to pay down that debt \u2013 that short-term debt.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. This might seem kind of silly to just focus on a small part of your portfolio, but with 320,000 acres in Uruguay, you only had $1 million in EBITDA? So is there something about the accounting that keeps the cash or the contribution in South America?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, there's nothing that would keep cash in any given place, Steve. So, as we've said, as part of this, we're going to be evaluating our 13.2 million acres of Timberland and making decisions as to what we want the long-term portfolio to look like; with 13.2 million acres and no big tax in place, we have lots of flexibility.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Yeah. I mean, I don't know how much managerial bandwidth it takes, but it's not a big contribution. And then switching gears, I assume that NORPAC and the Longview mill will also be sold. I'm just wondering, does that have any implications for your export terminal at the Port of Longview?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. That has no implications for that.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay, thanks. And one other quick clarification \u2013 maybe I need a hearing aid. I think Russell referenced Q2 2013, and you referenced Q2 2014 when you were talking about the Wood Products run rate?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "If I said Q2 2014 that was a mistake. The reference was to Q2 2013.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Great. It was a better quarter. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hi. Thank you; and I know you guys have been working hard the last few months. Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Chip.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "First question has to do \u2013 thank you \u2013 is with the pension income. I know \u2013 should that continue to be at the higher level that we saw in the first quarter at roughly, I think, it was $9 million per quarter for the whole year?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I think on the pension income we're expecting a little improvement in 2016.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And so at the same \u2013 should it be similar in the second, third, and fourth to the amount you showed on unallocated items in the first quarter?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. That would be our expectation.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then on the depletion side, I know you said something about $90 million. When I look at the first quarter of 2016 versus 2015, it was up about $37 million. Are you saying it should be up year-over-year therefore by \u2013 are you saying depletion should be up $90 million or EBITDA should be up $90 million from \u2013 which is probably saying the same thing, since EBIT is going to be flat. But I just want to make sure I had that progression right for Timberlands?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. So the depletion and amortization for the second quarter will be $90 million and that's a fair number to use through third and fourth quarter also.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then how about the depletion for the real estate segment in the second quarter?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "You can probably look at what the first quarter was like as a pretty good guide.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Even though your real estate sales will pick up a little bit?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Second quarter they will probably be similar to first quarter, and then pick up in the second half of the year.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay, got you. And then next question has to do with the \u2013 I think Doyle mentioned the real estate sales would be ramping to eventually around a $350 million EBITDA level sort of a target out there. Should we see that \u2013 is 2018 a realistic year that you think you'll get there, or is that pushing it too soon?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think that's pushing it to too fine a point, Chip. Again, we're right in the middle of the AVO process. Again, what we wanted to do is just give some guidance as to the potential magnitude of the real estate business at 15% to 20% of the overall EBITDA for the company. We're going to learn a lot more as we go through this process. So, we'll be further refining that in terms of the timing as we move forward.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And last quick one, the business you just announced you sold to IP, is that going to be reported as a normal segment until it's sold or are you going to split it out as a discontinued operations, or have you figured that out yet?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "The pulp business will be asset held for sale, so it would be a discontinued operation starting in second quarter.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Oh, okay, important. And so when you give us adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, you will not include the income from that business?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Correct. You'll be able to see it in our presentation, so you can run your calculations.", "Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Chip.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russ.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah. Doyle, I have a couple of portfolio questions. I think one of them you've answered already, and that is just, any potential portfolio repositioning within the Timberlands, maybe concentrating more going forward on plantations in the South and in the Northwest?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. As I mentioned, Mark, as part of the integration process we're going to \u2013 it's going to involve a review of the overall Timberlands portfolio. And again, as I mentioned with 13-plus million acres and no built-in gains tax we've got lots of flexibility as to how we create the most value for our shareholders going forward. So, that work is ongoing.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay, and is it fair to say that the focus is going to be kind of plantation forestry, Doyle?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't want to exclude anything at this point, Mark. Let us do the work and figure out exactly what we want the portfolio to look like as we move forward.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And then the second one I had is just kind of on capital allocation going forward, particularly thinking about what your business investment focus is going to be. You're selling the Cellulose Fibers business. That was clearly a forestry-related business that had a good cash return. And if I look over at kind of Plum, historically, they had invested in a limited scale in things like gravel pit participations, which looked like they were lower return businesses and not forestry-related. So, if we think kind of going forward, are there any bounds you would want us to kind of think about in terms of where you'll put capital and where you won't put capital?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, Mark, as you know, we've done a lot of work here at Weyerhaeuser over the past few years to really focus our company. And as we say in where we're headed, we're going to the premier timberland and forest products company going forward. So, I wouldn't \u2013 I think, as you see us, first and foremost, we're going to focus on delivering the value from the Plum Creek merger. As we look to invest going forward, Mark, I would tell you, it's going to be focused on those areas. We do not anticipate moving into other areas \u2013 or non-forest-related areas in any significant way.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. That's helpful. Good luck in the second quarter and through the balance of the year.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call...", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm sorry. Go ahead.", "Operator", "I'm sorry. Please go ahead.", "Doyle R.

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode.", "Following the presentation, the conference will be open forquestions (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded Wednesday,October 31st, 2007.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Kathy McAuley,Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Kathy McAuley", "Good morning, and welcome to Weyerhaeuser's third quarter2007 earnings conference call. I'm Kathy McAuley, Vice President of InvestorRelations. Joining me today are Steve Rogel, Chairman, President, and CEO, RichHanson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Patty Bedient,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Fulton, Presidentof Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.

Please review thewarning statement in our press release and on the presentation slidesconcerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.", "I will now turn the call over to Steve Rogel. Steve? ", "Steve Rogel", "Thanks, Kathy, and to all of our callers for joining ustoday. A little later on this call, you'll hear from Kathy, Dan Fulton, RichHanson, and Patty Bedient. They will provide more detail on the operatingresults we announced this morning and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Butbefore they do, I'd like to give you a brief overview.", "Third quarter results were obviously affected by thecontinuing weakness of the housing market. As we noted in our earnings releasetoday, this downturn deepened during the quarter and affected many of ourbusinesses.", "The regions in which WRECO operates have certainly felt theimpact of the slowdown, as Dan will discuss. Our real estate companies areperforming better than many of their peers. This is due in large part to themarkets we're in, the niches we serve, and the steps we've taken to prepare fora downturn.", "Looking ahead, we remain bullish on the housing market. Aswe've discussed before, the long-term demographic trends support not only arebound from today's levels but a strong housing market for the long-term.", "In addition to managing through the current market, our jobis to position ourselves to take full advantage of stronger markets whenconditions improve. We've done just that in both WRECO and iLevel. It is alsoour belief that over the long-term, the markets in which our real estatebusiness operates will be among the strongest in the country, and that WRECO iswell positioned to benefit from this.", "In wood products, the weakness in the housing markets islikely to affect our businesses for sometime. Rich will outline the steps we'vetaken to balance supply with demand through closures, curtailments, restrictedoperating postures at the company's wood products facilities.", "Our iLevel approach, which gives us great line of sight toour customers' ultimate needs, helped us develop these responses to marketconditions. We're also better able to anticipate what our customers want fromus in the future.", "This allows us to begin product development today fortomorrow, and it positions Weyerhaeuser to be the leading supplier. Ourtimberlands business was affected by softening in the log markets this quarter.But long-term we see opportunities to maximize revenue from our 6 million acresof fee owned timberlands.", "In addition to our ongoing timber management, exciting newrevenue opportunities include our biofuel alliance with Chevron, carboncredits, and oil, gas, and mineral extraction.", "We are committed to ensuring that our shareholders receivethe full benefits from these valuable holdings. To that end, our work onstructural alternatives continues, and we are actively supporting theindustry's ongoing tax reform efforts.", "Bipartisan support for the Tree Act of 2007 is growing.Passage of this legislation would provide immediate value to shareholders andis compatible with many different business strategies. Our strategic decisionto focus on specialty pulp also is paying dividends.", "Today absorbent and specialty fibers account for virtuallyour entire pulp portfolio, allowing us to leverage our research and developmentexpertise. Strong market conditions resulted in higher prices in the thirdquarter. But more importantly, the outstanding operating performance of ourcellulose fibers mills positioned us to capitalize on this improvement. Richwill provide further details in his report.", "Finally, our containerboard packaging and recycling businessis successfully implementing its new business model while we continue ourstrategic review of the business. As previously discussed, these alternativesrange from continuing to hold and operate the business to a possible sale,disposition, or combination.", "The process is ongoing. But due to confidentialityrequirements, I can't say more at this time. We are confident, however, that weare taking the right steps to create the greatest value for our shareholders.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Kathy McAuley, whowill provide some additional details on the results we reported this morning.Kathy?", "Kathy McAuley", "Thank you, Steve. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported thirdquarter earnings of $101 million or $0.47 per diluted share, on net sales of$4.1 billion. The third quarter includes the following after tax items. Acharge of $17 million or $0.08 per diluted share for closures, restructuringand asset impairments in our wood product segment.", "A charge of $17 million or $0.08 per diluted share relatedto the restructuring of administrative function, including a regional Canadianoffice and one-time cost associated with the transition to a new IT servicesprovider.", "A charge of $16 million or $0.07 per diluted share for theimpairment of real estate assets. A net gain of $26 million or $0.12 perdiluted share related to legal settlements. A net gain of $7 million or $0.03per diluted share on the sale of operation and previously closed plant sites.", "Excluding these items, the company earned $118 million or$0.55 per share. A GAAP reconciliation of special items is available at ourwebsite in the earnings information package.", "In that package, please turn to chart 12, which is areconciliation of the key changes in earnings per share before special itemsbetween Q2 2007 and Q3 2007. Second quarter 2007 earnings before special itemswere $0.48 per share.", "Lower volumes reduced earnings $0.12 per share. The largestvolume decline were in wood products. Price and mix were a negative $0.12 pershare. This decline was due to lower log and wood products prices and a lessfavorable seasonal mix of businesses in containerboard.", "High cellulose fiber prices partially offset this result.Manufacturing cost contributed $0.19 per share, driven by productivityimprovement and lower energy cost in containerboard packaging and recycling andproductivity increases coupled with less maintenance downtime in cellulosefibers.", "Real estate related assets contributed $0.03 per share.Other contributed $0.09 per share partially due to SG&A reduction. Thirdquarter 2007 earnings before special items were $0.55 per share.", "I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton to discussWeyerhaeuser Real Estate Company results.", "Dan Fulton", "Good morning. Trends in earnings and other key operatingmetrics for real estate in the third quarter and year-to-date 2007 reflect thevery difficulty business conditions that we were encountering. Negativemomentum in the national housing markets discussed in last conference callscontinued in the third quarter and conditions seem poised to deterioratefurther over the balance of the year.", "Excess inventories of both new and existing homes, declininghome prices, and tightened credit standards have rocked most local markets.Consumers are understandably cautious in this environment. And many havewithdrawn from an active search pending stabilization in prices and easieraccess to the mortgage market.", "As stated in this morning's press release, real estateearned $60 million in the third quarter compared to $64 million last quarterand $135 million in the same quarter one year ago. Earnings in the currentquarter included a $30 million gain on land sales and last quarter's earningsincluded a $42 million gain on sale of an apartment project.", "Considering the very difficult market conditions across theindustry, we're pleased with the relative performance of our operations. Thirdquarter earnings included $23 million in impairment charges for lots impactedby unfavorable market conditions. Earnings for the second quarter of the yearand for the third quarter a year ago also included impairment charges of $12million and $14 million respectively.", "Single-family operations generated 88% of revenue in thethird quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, single-family operations havegenerated 91% of revenue this year compared to 93% last year. A 10% decline inaverage sale price in the third quarter compared to the same quarter a year agoreflects the intensely competitive pricing environment for new homes, changesin sales mix to lower priced product, and a slight shift in our geographic mixto the relatively healthier, but lower priced Houston and Puget Sound markets.", "With the burden of excess inventory, builders across thecountry continue to aggressively discount standing units, effectively rewardingbuyers who withdraw from the market to wait for price stabilization. Thesemarket forces are driving expectations for lower pricing in order to clearexcess inventory in a period of slack demand.", "For these reasons, we believe virtually all of the marketsin which we operate have additional downside price risk in the near term. PugetSound region has been our strongest market this year with year-to-date salessignificantly higher than during 2006. However, traffic and sales were weak inthe third quarter, both trending below the pace set in the prior year andinventories have increased.", "Houston has been steady in 2007, although moderated from thevery active levels of a year ago. Market remains reasonably healthy,particularly in our targeted market segment of move-up buyers. The suburban Washington,D.C. market started the year stronger than expected but weakened in response tothe record level of existing home inventories.", "Our own sales have increased year-over-year in 2007, due inpart to increased lot availability in our communities. Las Vegas, Phoenix,Sacramento, and the Inland Empire of Southern California represent our mostchallenging markets, each of which is characterized by significant inventoryoverhang, deep sales price discounting, and high contract cancellation rates.", "These markets remain negative despite strong underlyingfundamentals, including continued job growth. The markets in Los Angeles andSan Diego have moderated compared to a year ago, but competitively pricedproduct and good locations will attract buyers. Housing affordability remains along-term structural issue in these markets.", "We're fortunate that the recent wave of fires in SouthernCalifornia did not affect our existing communities, though we have sufferedsome wind damage in our inland empire communities. Although there may beshort-term spike in regional demand, especially for standing inventory, weexpect that our operations will likely experience diminishability ofsubcontractors and local regulatory staff as priorities appropriately shift toremediation efforts.", "Across the industry, single-family gross margins are underpressure from deep discounting in the market, particularly on standing units.At WRECO, third quarter single-family gross margins were 17.9%, an increasefrom 16.7% in the second quarter due to a shift in mix, but down compared to26.1% in the same quarter a year ago.", "On a year-to-date basis, single-family gross margins were18.7% this year compared to 27.5% last year. With the continuing overhang ofinventory in many local markets, we expect our margins to deteriorate furthernext quarter.", "We control land representing about seven years of sales, ofwhich approximately 55% is owned. Declining new home prices have increased thelikelihood that land controlled in recent years may have valuation issues,particularly if controlled during periods when land markets were hyperactive in2005 and later.", "We monitor our land positions on a quarterly basis. Usingconsistent practices, we recognized impairment charges in the third quarter of$23 million as compared to $12 million last quarter and $14 million in thethird quarter of last year. Additionally, we recognized charges of $1.3 millionfor abandoned deposits and pre-acquisition costs in the third quarter comparedto $800,000 last quarter and $5.5 million in the third quarter of last year.", "The bulk of our land acquisitions in 2005, 2006, and 2007have been lot takedowns in existing communities with the exception of ouracquisition of Maracay Homes in Phoenix in February 2006. On an overall basis,a high percentage of our land position today was controlled via acquisition oroption in 2004 and prior. We're not isolated from the actions of otherhomebuilders, including the public companies, virtually all of which havereported major impairment charges in each successive quarter over the past twoyears.", "These charges effectively reduce the cost basis of futurehome deliveries for our competitors and increase the pressure on us incompeting communities. If a competitors' impairment charge results in asignificant disparity in value compared to our community, we may choose to takea compensating sales price reduction. We're focused on controlling thecontrollable and we have taken the following management actions in order toremain as efficient with our capital as possible.", "We reduced the number of housing starts in the third quarterby 41% compared to the prior quarter. Our current completed and unsoldinventory position of 451 units represents approximately 33 days sales.Approximately 50% of our completed and unsold inventory today is in Las Vegas.Virtually all land acquisition obligations under purchase and option agreementshave been renegotiated. In some circumstances, we canceled our option andwritten off deposits and pre-acquisition costs.", "Many sellers, however, have recognized the current marketenvironment and our negotiations have resulted in reductions in price, changesin terms, or both. This is an ongoing process, and we'll have more work to doif the market slowdown continues.", "Our vendors and subcontractors are also supporting ourefforts to remain competitive by reducing costs in order to help mitigate someof the impact of price discounting. Lastly, we've reduced generaladministrative expense by nearly 12% in the third quarter compared to the samequarter last year. Additionally, we selectively reduced field staff as wecontinue to balance supply with demand. And now I'll turn the call over toRich.", "Rich Hanson", "Thank you, Dan. I will continue by providing an operationaloverview of our other business segments. As expected, the weak housing marketalso had a significant impact on the results of our wood products andtimberlands businesses in the third quarter.", "Wood products obviously was most affected, but we alsostarted seeing some negative effect on log prices during the quarter. I knowthat everyone understands that the plummeting national housing starts arehaving an effect on our wood products markets. But for perspective, on aseasonally adjusted basis, housing starts for the third quarter were down 24%from a same period a year ago and down 11% since the second quarter.", "In addition, we are experiencing significant weakness in therepair and remodel market. Because of lower sales volumes in our wood productsbusinesses during the quarter, we have aggressively worked to balance oursupply with customer demand. We are continuing that effort, as demonstrated byour recent announcements that by year-end we will indefinitely curtailproduction at two oriented strand board mills and a timber strand mill.", "Taking into account the recently announced mill closures, wewill be operating our oriented strand board and timber strand system at lessthan 60% of capacity. We expect to take further action in the fourth quarter asnecessary to match our production to demand. The wood products businesscontinues to proactively reduce working capital consistent with this reduceddemand in the business restructuring.", "We estimate by year-end, working capital will beapproximately 30% lower than yearend last year. As reported by Random Lengths,the average oriented strand board prices for the third quarter are at theirlowest level since late 2002 and the quarterly average price for lumber is atits lowest since 2000.", "Regarding timberlands, last quarter I mentioned that logprices had remained sticky and hadn't necessarily tracked the housing marketslowdown. That changed in the third quarter, especially in the west, whereprices declined for both domestic and export log sales. Industry log usage declinedas mills in the west began taking downtime to adjust production levels to thedeclining demand.", "Although southern mills are also adjusting to lower demand,log volume and prices were stronger in that region due to an increased demandfor chips and restricted log and stumping supply.", "Meanwhile, a weak Japanese housing market affected our logexport business. I just returned from Japan where I met with Chugoku Mokuzai,our largest log export customer. I learned that construction delays caused aportion of this weakening building market as new building regulations wererecently implemented.", "The strength of the Japanese market, however, remainsuncertain as we move into a seasonally slow period. Sales of non-strategictimberlands, as you can see during the quarter, offset some of the downwardeffect on earnings from lower log sales.", "In containerboard, the industry containerboard millscontinue at high operating rates, and inventories are low. In addition,inefficient box plant capacity has been coming out of this industry supplysystem. We've closed 12 plants since January '06.", "We've had a smooth implementation of our $40 a toncontainerboard price increase and we anticipate that a majority of that priceincrease will be recovered in box price this year. The lag in the full recoveryis because some of our businesses in long-term agreements that we will berenegotiating during 2008, and that will give us better pricing flexibility.But what is more important is our focus on company margins here.", "We continue to implement a demand driven business model incontainerboard packaging. We will achieve our projected $100 million in savingsin 2007 as part of the two-year goal of $230 million and we are continuing tomove aggressively with plant rationalizations and customer selection aligningto our capabilities to improve margins.", "And finally, in cellulose fibers, this segment benefitedfrom higher third quarter prices due to strong market conditions. During thequarter, third party realizations for absorbent pulp increased $26 a ton andthis is an $85 a ton increase since third quarter of last year.", "More important, due to the significant improvements in theoperating performance in this segment, we are positioned to capture the maximumrevenue and bring this price improvement to the bottom line. Production fromcellulose fiber mills increased by 26,000 tons in the third quarter, in part toone less annual maintenance outage in the quarter compared to the secondquarter. But four of the cellulose fiber mills set quarterly productionrecords.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Patty Bedient, whowill outline our fourth quarter expectations.", "Patty Bedient", "Thanks, Rich. And good morning. Our outlook for the fourthquarter anticipates continued challenging market conditions for all of ourhousing driven businesses. As a result, we expect difficult underlyingfundamentals in timberlands, wood products and home building.", "On a positive note, economic drivers for our cellulosefibers and containerboard packaging segments should result in favorableoperating earnings in the fourth quarter compared to the third. I'll start theoutlook with our timberland segment.", "The continued weakness in the housing market is expected toresults in lower domestic and export log prices. We estimate the harvest in thewest will decrease while southern harvest will be flat with the third quarter.Sales of non-strategic timberland are anticipated to be lower in the fourthquarter compared to the greater than normal levels in the third.", "Overall, timberland segment earnings are expected todecrease in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. In wood products,the traditional seasonal slowdown of the fourth quarter will be furthercompounded by the anemic housing market.", "Sales realizations are expected to continue to deterioratein the fourth quarter over most of our product line. Shipment volumes are alsoestimated to decline. The restricted operating postures that Rich outlinedearlier will continue, and we will take further action as necessary to matchproduction with demand and manage working capital.", "Despite these efforts, we expect that fourth quarteroperating losses will deepen as compared to the third quarter levels.", "Containerboard shipments are expected to increase due to thestrong demand in export markets. Rights realization should also improve as theboard price increases announced during the last quarter are in place for thefull quarter.", "Box shipments are estimated to decline seasonally in thefourth quarter compared to the third. Prices should move up as increases fromthe third quarter announcements are realized more fully in the fourth quarter.The effect of price increases will be moderated somewhat due to seasonalchanges in mix.", "OCC prices are expected to moderate somewhat over the thirdquarter level and will likely remain high given the Asian demand. We anticipateincreased energy cost based on greater seasonal usage and higher natural gasprices.", "The non-fiber mill manufacturing cost should increase due tomore scheduled maintenance downtime in the fourth quarter than in the third.Packaging manufacturing costs are also expected to increase, mainly due toseasonally lower volume.", "Overall, we expect fourth quarter earnings in ourcontainerboard-packaging segment to be comparable to the third quarter.", "We believe markets for cellulose fibrous products willremain favorable throughout the fourth quarter. Shipments are anticipated toincrease slightly and sales realization should remain strong. The mills arerunning well, and with less scheduled maintenance downtime in the fourthquarter, manufacturing costs are expected to decrease compared to the thirdquarter.", "As a result, we anticipate higher cellulose fiber segmentearnings in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. We expect businessconditions for our real estate segment to deteriorate further in the fourthquarter. Volume, price, and margins in our single-family home building activitywill be impacted by intensely competitive market conditions.", "Homebuilders are aggressively positioning in an environmentwith fewer buyers and higher inventories of new and resale homes. We expect toclose approximately 1,200 single-family homes in the fourth quarter and we areevaluating the prospects of selling certain non-strategic land parcels.", "However, the likelihood and timing of closing thesetransactions cannot be estimated. Exclusive of such land sales, we expectoverall segment earnings to decline in the fourth quarter compared to thethird.", "Capital expenditures for Weyerhaeuser Company were $454million through September 30. Expenditures for the full year should be closerto $725 million as compared to our earlier budgeted amount of $800 million. Wehave now completed our share repurchase authorization, and in the third quarterwe purchased nearly 7 million shares for about $440 million, these purchasescontributed to our increased debt level at the end of the quarter.", "During the fourth quarter we will continue our focus onmanaging capital spending, working capital, and cash flow management in orderto reduce our debt levels.", "With that overview, I'll turn the call back to Kathy tobegin our question-and-answer session. Kathy?", "Kathy McAuley", "Patty. Eric, could we open the floor for questions, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from GeorgeStaphos with Banc of America. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. First question aroundcontainerboard and packaging, Rich, I was wondering if you could give us a bitmore color on the things that are going well for you with the business -- thenew business plan, new business model, and things that you're still finding achallenge with.", "It would appear that it's still somewhat difficult movingthe pricing ball towards the goal line because of the lag effect that you havewith some of these contracts. If you could add a little color there, that wouldbe great, and then I have a couple of follow ons?", "Rich Hanson", "Okay, George. Well, your description is really prettyaccurate. I think what's going well is the rationalization and the transitionof business to the remaining plants in a more efficient system. It's going welland on schedule.", "As I said as we are tracking our own cost and marginimprovements in those initiatives, we are well on schedule against the $230million permanent margin improvement. But as you say, as we go through and wehave some major national contracts that we need to renegotiate to get relief onfactor cost increases and board cost increases, that's where we still have somechallenge in front of us.", "We've been very pleased with the price increases that wehave gotten on those contracts that are open, and the percentage of businesswe've been able to transition.", "George Staphos - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Was there a mix factor at all in the third quarter versusthe second quarter in terms of why we didn't see a bit more of a price lift inboxes?", "Rich Hanson", "Absolutely. The E. coli scare in green vegetables had animpact in the lower volume in the produce segment. As we said in the past,that's an attractive margin segment for us. And we experienced lower volumethere. And overall the produce market is becoming more competitive as well.", "George Staphos - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Okay. You may have mentioned this in the past but I justwanted to get a refresher here. Should we expect more in the way of potentialbox plant closings as you complete the program?", "Rich Hanson", "We'll continue to look at how we can serve the highestmargin segments of the business, and we will structure our business includingmore rationalization to improve those margins.", "George Staphos - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Okay. I'm sorry, Kathy?", "Kathy McAuley", "Thank you. We'll have our next question.", "George Staphos - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "I'll turn it over. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly fromCredit Suisse.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Just one question. Rich talked about the excess capacity inthe engineered board businesses. I wonder if you could put that in perspectivefor us. Because, when we look at the numbers this quarter, it looks like yousaw a pretty big drop year-over-year relative to the drop you saw in lumber.", "Is that just, am I just looking at that too superficially?It looks like engineered wood is getting hit a lot harder than lumber. Is thatnot correct in the big picture?", "Rich Hanson", "I'll try to respond to what you're looking at. This capacitycomes out in significant lumps. And as we have taken this capacity downespecially coming into the second half of this year, I think you see it moreabruptly happening. But there's been real pressure on this with the loweroperating rates as we've come through the whole year.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Skidmore of GoldmanSachs. Please go ahead.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Just to follow up on the containerboardquestion, how much of the business is tied to long-term contracts and how muchof the business is currently open for pricing to get better?", "Rich Hanson", "Well, I can't be specific about that but more than we wouldlike. As I said, we will realize the majority of that price increase as we comeout through yearend. But I really can't be specific about exact percentagesthere.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Pleasego ahead.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Hi. Thank you. Sticking on containerboard, part of yourwhole restructuring has been to analyze the markets a bit more carefully andget hopefully more insight into the demand side. I'm just wondering, lookingpast the fourth quarter into '08, what you're hearing from your customers interms of box demand?", "Rich Hanson", "I'm sorry, the very last part of your question, you broke upa bit. Could you repeat?", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "I'm sorry. I'm just wondering, I guess, what sense you'regetting from your customers about their outlook for box demand in 2008.", "Rich Hanson", "I think reasonably positive. Overall, the economy is stillin pretty good shape but there's a lot of concerns about the general economiclevel of activity, but in general positive. As I've said, the price increaseshave been going very smoothly.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. Just a separate question. Kathy, can you break outsome of the maintenance cost that you had both in cellulose and containerboardin the quarter and maybe a sense of the magnitude of the shift in the fourthquarter?", "Kathy McAuley", "Gail, we don't break out specific maintenance cost items inthe quarter. We did have significant productivity improvements in bothcontainerboard and in the cellulose fiber business. We had less maintenancedowntime in cellulose fibers, which was also a positive in that quarter. Butboth of them saw significant improvements in productivity.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Ruschmeier with LehmanBrothers. Please go ahead.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I was curious if you couldcomment on your view of the timber tax bill both in terms of likelihood, timingof events. The challenges it faces, whether we have funding for the tax cuts.And importantly whether that passage has any impact on potential futurerestructuring plans for Weyerhaeuser.", "Steve Rogel", "Thanks, Pete. First of all, with regard to timber tax, I'mconfident of its passage. You are asking for comment as to when, and that's thedifficult part. So let me tell you the positives about it and it's movingforward. First is I think you're well aware, it has a tremendous amount ofco-sponsorship.", "The bill has been introduced. It's been attached to twovehicles moving along. Removed from them is the prospects for the main bill,look to Dimmer. But some of those main bills now have higher prospects ofpassage. So our open expectation is that our timber tax vehicle will ride alongwith them.", "With regard to how it's viewed, it has been scored, which isCongress speak for they have determined what the costs of the bill are. Andthey actually came out pretty well. And they have found ways to fund it. Whatwe hear from the floor is that this will pass. It's a matter of being patientand watch Congress make their sausage.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And whether it has an impact on your restructuringplans, is it?", "Steve Rogel3", "Well, whatever our plans are, the Tree Act is good for us.Because it has elements of support for the entire industry regardless of itsform of ownership. So it's well worth pursuing now and into the future.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "And just lastly if I could, Steve, does it specifically oncontainerboard, does it have anything to do with the timing on containerboard,the delays we've seen so far on containerboard? Does that have anything to doon timber tax or is it a completely separate issue?", "Steve Rogel", "Those are completely separate issues.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks very much. I'll drop back in queue.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. I heard Lynn Michaelis at a big industryconference about two and half weeks ago. He talked about a housing downturn thatwould be as severe as the early 80s. He was talking about single-family startsgoing down to about 900,000 units with a risk on the downside.", "I'm just curious, is this the scenario you're using fordecision making in the different parts of your portfolio? And really, what arethe implications of 900,000 single-family starts or less?", "Dan Fulton", "This is Dan. I'll take the first crack at this. We're usingLynn's forecast to judge overall demand and to look at economics across theentire country. But when it comes to our individual markets, we are atdifferent points in the cycle, and so we are making decisions based upon localdynamics.", "However, that kind of a stark forecast does have an impacton policy in the mortgage markets and I think in providing some guidance in Fedactions. So we are taking that forecast into consideration with otherforecasts. But we are managing defensively because of that, focusing onindividual competitiveness in the markets in which we operate.", "Rich Hanson", "This is Rich. Just further comment about that kind of anoutlook. Of course it's only prudent to plan for some of this downside. I thinkthat the best example of that is the action that we took in oriented strandboard and timber strand.", "As we've explained in earlier calls, these closures inCanadian facilities are very costly with regard to severance. And you have tobelieve that there's not relief in the near term in order to do that. So tosome extent, yes, it is impacting our decisions and we think that's onlyprudent.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Very good. Is it possible to get a number for thosetimberland sales in the third quarter?", "Rich Hanson", "The difference between second and third quarter was in therange of $40 million increase and around $50 million, but it was a quarterly, alarger number than normal in quarterly results.", "Steve Rogel", "I think we termed these things as lumpy during the year.", "Rich Hanson", "Because we negotiate them and we complete the transactionwhen we can realize the best value. So it's going to tend to be lumpy throughthe year.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Yes. I understood.", "Patty Bedient", "You might remember that on our call for the second quarter,we did talk about the fact that we anticipated we would have a greater thannormal amount in the third quarter, because some of those that were planned inthe second quarter actually moved into the third.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with BuckinghamResearch. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham ResearchGroup", "Thank you. First, Steve, I just wanted a quick clarificationwhen you were answering Pete's question, he had asked whether or not the TreeAct and delays on containerboard had any linkage, and you said no. Can you justremind us if you've laid out any timeframes? I wasn't sure, have there beendelays on containerboard? It wasn't clear to me.", "Steve Rogel", "As I indicated, Mark, in my prepared remarks, there's verylittle I can say because of confidentiality requirements about that process. Iwill say that we are looking at a variety of strategic directions for it. Thosebecause of the wide variety take more time. Some of them require a great dealof time because it's a due diligence effort on two different classes or sets ofassets. So the kind of process we're following to achieve the maximumshareholder value just takes time.", "Patty Bedient", "Mark, to your direct question and to Pete'scharacterization, we have not talked about a delay in the containerboardprocess at all.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham ResearchGroup", "Fair enough. And then if you could just also provide alittle bit more color, possibly, on what the timberland sales, I guess about$50 million or $55 million of profits in the quarter. Were those some largertracts or were you again doing smaller tracts here, there, and everywhere?", "Rich Hanson", "Pretty normal. I don't have the list in front of me. Nomajor tracts, no.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham ResearchGroup", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question? ", "Operator", "Our next question comes with Chip Dillon with Citi. Pleasego ahead.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Yes, good morning. Could you just review for us, clarify onething. You said in the press release it says that land sales in the fourthquarter might offset part of the decline you expect from single-familyclosings? I think, Patty, you said on the call you left open the possibilitythat you could see completely offset or even a higher real estate number.", "Secondly, could you define your backlog? You used to talkabout it in terms of months. Was that 33-day figure that was mentioned thebacklog or was that the inventory of houses? Could you just tell us what thebacklog is?", "Dan Fulton", "Chip, this is Dan. I'll take both of those. We do have saleson an ongoing basis as you know of what we call non-strategic land. That landcould be commercially zoned, apartment zoned land. We sell it in most of theoperations where we have master planned communities or land that may have thosecharacteristics. And with respect to Q4, we have a number of transactions thatare in process.", "Our guidance that Patty provided was that we would expectthat that would help to offset the decline that we do anticipate insingle-family that would come from margins and pricing. With respect tobacklog, our backlog's at about four months. It's down slightly from lastquarter. When I referred to the number of days of sales, in my remarks that wasreferring to our standing inventory.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Got you. It sounds like it's not likely. But if a lot ofthese land sales did come together, that would allow you to beat the $83million you had without impairments in the most recent quarter. But if it'ssort of a best guess, maybe it's not quite as high as that.", "Dan Fulton", "Can't handicap it to date.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Don Roberts with CIBC WorldMarkets. Please go ahead.", "Don Roberts - CIBC World Markets", "Thank you. Steve, two questions. First of all, just gettingback to the Tree Act, you mentioned it's attached to two vehicles that arelikely to pass. Could you just refresh me on when are sort of generally themilestones we should be looking at for those vehicles in terms of timelines?", "Steve Rogel67 ", "Oh, I can't speculate on when any individual bill might gothrough. Politics is everything. And what I was really referring to is a coupleof bills that appeared dead because of huge differences between the twoparties. Now it seemed to be coming back to life because they are in conferenceand working out differences. But it would be extremely hard for me as anamateur at that sort of stuff to give you a prediction of when those bills willmake it out.", "Don Roberts - CIBC World Markets", "Okay. And an unrelated question, you had mentioned in youropening remarks about the strategic initiative with Chevron on the cellulosicethanol. Any kind of updates or How much sort of credence or emphasis we shouldput on that type of initiative.", "Steve Rogel", "Well, our work with Chevron has proceeded forward, as weindicated at the outset. That was a letter of intent to be negotiated into ajoint venture and that's proceeded well. So as two companies, we have somesimilar philosophies and we seem to be getting along well in that area. Andwe're moving right forward with the venture.", "Don Roberts - CIBC World Markets", "Okay. And again, any kind of timeline where we might expectan announcement on when that's finalized, the venture?", "Steve Rogel", "I can't give you a forward time.", "Don Roberts - CIBC World Markets", "Thank you.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with MerrillLynch. Please go ahead.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Morning. Thank you. Just had a couple of questions. On theTree Act. If you do get some form of tax relief legislation, would youpotentially become a more active acquirer of timberland?", "Steve Rogel", "Certainly we've indicated many times that Timber R Us. If wedo get tax relief, that allows us to be more competitive in the acquisition oftracts. But I couldn't speculate for you which or when. But it does allow us tobe more competitive in the market.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. Just in terms of the wood products business,Weyerhaeuser has really taken a lot of aggressive actions to control supply anddemand internally. What do you think it will take to see more a aggressiverationalization by the industry of Canadian lumber capacity and do you foreseethat occurring?", "Steve Rogel", "I can't talk about the strategies of other companies inNorth America, but certainly I think this industry has become more mature inits management of capacity against demand. The actions we've taken I think demonstratethat.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A.Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Question for Dan Fulton. If we would try to handicap therisk in real estate, should we look at the land that real estate processed forsale and is already being transferred in fair market value and therefore notthat risky, but the land that's held for future development is the risky part?", "Dan Fulton", "No, I don't view it that way. We have a longer-term landposition than most. It's been part of our value proposition in this businessfor a long time. The length of our land position varies by market and it's afunction of the challenge of gaining entitlements and processing land in moreconstrained markets. What that does for us long-term is it translates intohigher margins.", "We believe a core competency in processing and managing landdevelopment. So our longer position is generally reflective of the fact we hadit tied up at lower prices for a longer period of time. We're creating valueand in fact think that that's why we have industry leading margins. So I maynot be addressing your specific questions, I'm concerned about that. But wedon't view the longer-term position to be more risky. We, in fact, view it tobe less risky.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Okay. So I guess just to clarify, it appears that you'redoing this differently than publicly traded competitors. Would you thereforeconclude there's less risk, although certainly you never said there was norisk?", "Dan Fulton", "There's always risk. We understand that. Most of ourcompetitors have a shorter position. I would say the one notable exception tothat is Toll Brothers, which like us maintains a longer position, does moreprocessing, and also generates the kinds of margins we do. So it's a differentbusiness model. We like ours.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Thank you.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with CreditSuisse. Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Just a question on the buybacks. I wonder if youcould tell us the average price for the quarter. Is the buyback complete? Doyou have an intention to ask the board for another buyback program?", "Patty Bedient", "Hi, Mark. This is Patty. I'll take that. We'll actually bedetailing all of the detail of the repurchases for the quarter in the Q thatwill be filed next week. We have now completed the buyback. I will tell youthat over the course of time that 18 million share repurchase authorization wasabout a little over -- a little less than $1.2 billion at a price just north of$64. We have completed that now and we also have reduced our shares earlierthis year by over $25 million shares in conjunction with the Domtartransaction.", "So, I think where we might go from here certainly would beup to the board. I think, as we look at our financial priorities, returningcash to shareholders is an important financial priority for us, both in termsof the stock buyback that we have completed as well as the dividends that wehave increased 50% since 2005.", "I wouldn't want to speculate what the board might do fromhere. I think our near-term priorities, as I mentioned in my outlook, iscontrolling our working capital and cash management and to bring our debtlevels down over the course of the quarter.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Very, helpful. Thanks, Patty.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Latta with McAdams WrightRagen. Please go ahead.", "Paul Latta - McAdams Wright Ragen", "Good morning and thanks for taking my call. Just a questionon the non-strategic timberland sales sounds like fewer non-strategictimberland sales for the fourth quarter. I have two questions. Is thatseasonal? And then also, how does the New Zealand transaction this morning thatwork through that timberlands? Does that go through the timberlands segment orwhere is that accounted for?", "Rich Hanson", "Excuse me. This is Rich. I'll start with the timberlands.No, they are not necessarily seasonal. And by the way, I looked at the numbersand the increase compared to the second quarter was $34 million. We tend tohave an ongoing program of divesting of non-strategic timberland.", "It tends to come in lumps. It's not seasonal. It's afunction of the negotiation and getting the best value for completing thetransaction. So, on New Zealand, yes Steve, do you want to comment on NewZealand?", "Steve Rogel", "Yes. We just had an announcement about the sale of ourportion of the New Zealand timberlands this morning. It\u2019s a deal that waspreviously announced and completed today.", "Paul Latta - McAdams Wright Ragen", "Rich, on the $34 million, is that just clarifying, is thatin proceeds or is that in operating profit contribution? What does the $34million mean?", "Rich Hanson", "That's an operating profit contribution.", "Paul Latta - McAdams Wright Ragen", "Great. Thank you.", "Steve Rogel", "I think that one of the other things that contributes totiming as we always look for some 1031 exchanges.", "Rich Hanson", "Well it yes Steve makes it important point that I believewe're in the 90% range on doing a 1031 exchange on those sales. So in otherwords, keeping the transaction tax-free.", "Paul Latta - McAdams Wright Ragen", "Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Kathy McAuley", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Rich just a follow-up on timberlands. We typicallysee kind of saw log prices lag the wood products market by six to 12 months.You mentioned that log prices came down in the third quarter. Would it be fairto assume that on average your sawtimber prices are likely to be lower for kindof full year '08 versus full year '07?", "Rich Hanson", "I'd have to look at that. But they really have hung up along time. So, and they tend to also be still not follow directly the productprices down so not necessarily.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Do you have any sense, kind of as you do your own planningfor next year, what you're thinking about in terms of kind of performance outof the timberland business both from timber sales as well as some of thesenon-strategic sales?", "Rich Hanson", "Well, we do, but we're not going to comment on a forwardlook that far out.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, very good. Thanks.", "Kathy McAuley", "I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from George Staphos ofBank of America. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Bank of AmericaSecurities", "Thanks everyone, two quick question. You mentioned thatconfidentiality agreements understandably restrict what you could say about thestrategic review in containerboard. Just for the record, last quarter were youunder confidentiality agreements relative to what you could say about thestrategic review? Just checking on that.", "And then separately, I was just wondering if you could giveyour thoughts on the board and voting term changes that you put into place.What was behind the moves? We view them positively, just was interested in yourthoughts there. Thanks, guys. Good luck on the quarter.", "Steve Rogel", "All right thanks. Well, two questions, George. First one isconfidentiality. Since we have entered the process, we have confidentiality inplace. So you can assume that we did in the previous quarter. With regard toour change on majority election of directors.", "Our board continuously reviews or governance practices andthey were proactive in implementing this amendment because they think it's inthe best interest of the company shareholders. The Washington law was changedrecently that allows for majority voting.", "In addition, plurality was kept in the law. That freed us upas a Washington chartered company to look at some changes that fit our company.And we think work pretty well for our shareholders.", "George Staphos - Bank of AmericaSecurities", "Thanks for the call, Steve. Again, good luck in the quarter.", "Steve Rogel", "Thanks.", "Kathy McAuley", "Thank you very much for joining us this morning. If you haveadditional questions, I'll be back in my office in a short time. The telephonenumber is 253-924-2058.

Forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.", "I will now the call over to Steve Rogel. Steve?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Kathy, and thanks everyone for joining us. 2007 was a challenging year for our industry and another busy one for Weyerhaeuser. On today's call, I would like to briefly discuss some of our strategic achievements in 2007 and update you on the progress we\u2019ve made on the various initiatives underway at Weyerhaeuser to improve performance and prepare us for the future. Then Kathy McAuley, Dan Fulton, Rich Hanson, and Patric Bedient will provide more detail on our businesses, fourth quarter operating results, and our first quarter outlook. As always, once that we have concluded our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions.", "Developing a deep pool of talented executives has been one of our key priorities, and in 2007 we made a number of changes to our management team and enhanced the talent on our Board with the addition of a new director. Most recently, we announced that Dan Fulton has been named President of Weyerhaeuser. Dan is overseeing operations in a number of staff functions along with his responsibilities as President of WRECO, our real estate company. Dan has a strong background in financial and operational management, and he's participated in our corporate decision making process for several years. Dan is an effective leader with a clear understanding of our company and the industry. We currently have a process in place to name Dan\u2019s successor as the President of WRECO and we hope to name that person by the end of first quarter.", "Another key change to our management team occurred with Patty Bedient who assumed the CFO last April upon the retirement of Dick Taggart. Patty is a valuable contributor to Weyerhaeuser and her knowledge of our strategic direction combined with our financial expertise makes her the ideal person to oversee our financial functions as we implement our strategic plan.", "Other notable appointments in 2007 included Tom Gideon as Senior Vice President of Containerboard Packaging and Recycling, and Mike Branson as Senior Vice President of Timberlands. Also in December 2006, Shaker Chandrasekaran was promoted to Senior Vice President of Cellulose Fibers. Each of these leaders has shown exceptional operating expertise and has already made significant contributions to the businesses they oversee.", "I know many of you are interested in an update on the review process for our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business. Well, I came limited in what I can say. I will tell you that we're pleased with the level of interest that we're seeing and with the range of options that the Board is able to consider. We look forward to concluding the process. In the meantime, our successful initiatives to improve the financial and operational performance of this business continue.", "Another major achievement in 2007 was the completion of our Fine Paper transaction with Domtar, which created meaningful value for our shareholders. The transaction also narrowed the focus of our Cellulose Fibers business onto value-added grades of pulp. This allows us to leverage Weyerhaeuser strengths, especially in R&D and product innovation.", "We've also made progress in implementing strategies to grow our Timberlands assets in South America. In October, we completed the sale and transfer of our New Zealand assets after receiving the necessary government approvals. This allows us to focus our international Timberlands investments in South America where we are in the process of simplifying our investment and management structure to maximize our flexibility. We look forward to continuing to build upon Weyerhaeuser's position in this region.", "Furthermore, we are intensely focused on realizing all of the potential income from owning Timberlands, not just the income from growing and harvesting timber. Weyerhaeuser generates additional revenue from activities such as mineral, oil, and gas extraction. We are excited about the potential of creating biofuels from cellulose, which is the purpose of our combined efforts with Chevron that we announced this last spring.", "We are also pleased with the progress made on the Tree Act, which is currently attached to the Senate-passed Farm Bill. This legislation is well positioned for enactment this year. Passage of the TREE Act of 2007 will provide immediate value to shareholders and is compatible with many different business strategies and structural alternatives.", "In conclusion, 2007 was a busy year in which we took action and made significant progress despite the challenging environment. We are executing on strategies to performance and create value. I'm proud of all that we have accomplished and I'm confident that we're taking the right steps to position Weyerhaeuser for even greater success.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Kathy to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s fourth quarter financial results. Kathy?", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Steve. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported a fourth-quarter loss of $63 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $3.9 billion. The fourth quarter includes the following after-tax items; a charge of $85 million or $0.40 per diluted share for impairments of a real estate assets and investments; a charge of $73 million or $0.35 per diluted share for closure, restructuring, and asset impairments in Wood Products; a charge of $22 million or $0.10 per diluted share from the true-up of deferred taxes related to the Domtar transaction; a gain of $27 million or $0.13 per diluted share on the sales of a log export facility in the New Zealand join venture; a net gain of $13 million or $0.06 per diluted share resulting from changes in the Canadian federal tax rate and in Mexican tax law; a charge of $13 million or $0.06 per share for corporate restructuring, a packaging plant closure, and the casualty laws associated with severe wind storm in the Pacific Northwest in early December. Excluding these items, Weyerhaeuser earned $90 million or $0.42 per diluted share. A GAAP reconciliation of special items is available at our website in the earnings information package.", "Please turn to chart four on page seven in this package for our next discussion. Chart four is a bar chart detailing the changes in earnings per share on a segment basis from third quarter of 2007 to fourth quarter of 2007. As noted in the first bar on chart four, Q3 2007 earnings before special items was $0.55 per share. Quarter-to-quarter changes in corporate earnings were as follows.", "Proceeding left to right across the waterfall chart beginning with the Timberlands segment, lower log prices in the West and fewer non-strategic land sales reduced Timberlands\u2019 earnings by $0.11 per share. In Wood Products, losses increased by $0.31 per share, resulting from significantly lower prices in [inaudible]. Lower material costs only slightly moderated the drop. Cellulose Fibers earnings were comparable to third quarter. Higher price realizations and an increase in sales volume were offset by higher chemicals, energy, and fiber costs. Containerboard, Packaging, and Recycling contributed $0.01 per share over Q3 earnings. About $0.10 per share improvement in Containerboard, Packaging price realization was offset by seasonally lower packaging shipments and decreased mill production as supply was matched with demand. We also incurred higher energy and wood fiber costs. WRECO increased $0.18 per share. Land and log sales accounted for most of the increase. Also contributing to the increase were seasonally higher closing and higher prices due do mix. Lastly, corporate and other added $0.10 per share. The usual year-end tax true-up accounted for the majority of the interest. The final bar to the far right of the page is fourth quarter 2007 earnings before special items of $0.42 per share.", "I will now turn the call over to Dan. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Thank you, Kathy. As I wear the hats of President of Weyerhaeuser and temporarily President of WRECO, my discussion is going to be a little different this quarter. To begin with, I will done my hat as the President of WRECO and give you a general overview of our real estate results for the fourth quarter. This will be a somewhat abbreviated version of my past presentations. However, all the data that I normally include is there on our website for your use. Then, I will put on my new hat as President of Weyerhaeuser to provide a general discussion of our economic outlook for 2008. This will help provide context for some of the comments Rich Hanson will make and will give a general idea of how we see the economic affecting our businesses in the current year.", "Although, differential by market, the dramatic correction that began in the housing sector in 2006 continued to negatively affect WRECO in the fourth quarter. Our Houston operation where we have a competitive niche at the high-end of the market performed at record levels. Meanwhile, the focus of our Puget Sound subsidiary on homes targeted at entry-level and first-time move-up buyers has allowed us to maintain our position as the leading homebuilder in a region that has held up longer than most other major markets.", "Despite these relatively strong performances, our real estate business is not immune to market woes. Last Vegas, Phoenix, and the Inland Empire of Southern California, which where some of the hottest markets during the first six years of this decade, are experiencing painful market adjustments. Considering current business conditions, near-term market stabilization in these markets seems unlikely for at least another year. Meanwhile, after beginning to signal stabilization in early 2007, the Washington D.C suburban markets retreated in response to increasing levels of unsold inventories and continued to struggle as the year closed. In addition, the stronger markets that I mentioned earlier are now beginning to show signs of fatigue. The Houston and Puget Sound markets will slow down from preceding years of strong activity, but are not likely to correct to the degree of other markets.", "As a major landowner in our select markets, we are also feeling the impact of declining valuations. As you've read, public homebuilders have recognized significant impairment charges as their holdings come under increased pressure. We control land representing approximately seven years of sales, of which 60% is owned. We are less vulnerable in that we own more land priced at three bubble levels. Nonetheless, our process of reviewing our land and investments on a quarterly basis resulted in us recognizing impairment charges of $121 million in the fourth quarter. This compares with $23 million in the third quarter and $19 million in the fourth quarter of last year. These impairment charges are all pretax numbers.", "The outlook for our real estate business is for a tough year ahead. Our management team however is one of the most experienced in the business and has seen challenging markets before. We are focused on minimizing incremental capital investment while maintaining a keen awareness of local land valuation trends for possible compelling future growth opportunities.", "I\u2019m now switching to my Weyerhaeuser Company now for a discussion of how economic conditions are affecting our other businesses. It is stating the obvious, but with effect of the unfavorable housing market upon the Wood Products industry is startling. The 1 million unit drop in single-family housing starts since the market\u2019s peak in 2006 equates to 9 billion square feet of oriented strand board and 15 billion [inaudible] feet of lumber. That amounts to 36% less demand for OSP and a 23% drop for lumber. Not surprisingly, prices have plunged. Recently, Douglas-fir lumber prices sank to nominal levels last seen in 1982, over 25 years ago.", "We'd like to say that we see it right on horizon, but as yet we do not. Looking ahead, we estimate that US single-family housing starts will continue to decline from 2007 levels. Although degree of additional decline in starts is debatable, any drop would put additional pressure on all of our Wood Products. We employed the recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, but it will take some time for this action to have a meaningful impact on the housing market. And until the housing market recovers, our Real Estate, Wood Products, and Timberlands businesses will struggle.", "In response to this sobering backdrop, our focus is on cost reduction and capital preservation, which Hanson will discuss in greater detail the actions that we're taking in our Wood Products and Timberlands businesses to meet the challenging market conditions ahead. At the same time, we are focusing on the future. Our actions today must also position us to maximize our opportunities when conditions improve. That is why later this spring we will start up our new Santiam sawmill in Oregon. This mill along with the improvements to the Grand Prairie facility in Canada and the new Longview, Washington mill allow us to replace older, less efficient sawmills. Consolidating our manufacturing into state-of-the-art facilities positions us to be a low-cost producer.", "In Timberlands, we are maintaining our growth strategy, which includes enhancing our investments in South America. Meanwhile, economic conditions for our Containerboard, Packaging, and Cellulose Fiber businesses are encouraging. Our Containerboard, Packaging business is benefiting from the growth on non-durable goods production. It has also been helped by the weaker US dollar, which has made our containerboard more competitive against offshore production. As long as international economic conditions remains strong, this business should continue to benefit from the weaker dollar. Meanwhile, our Cellulose Fiber's business also benefits from the week US dollars. As a result, prices for pulp are approaching 1995 levels of nearly $900 a ton. In addition, the completion of the Domtar transaction last year reduced our exposure to the Canadian exchange rate and focused our business on premium absorbent rates. We see continued strong markets in 2008 for this portion of our company.", "It's true we've challenges ahead, but I'm energized by the prospects for success that lie before us. I'm looking forward to working with all of our employees to seize these opportunities. I'm also looking forward to discussing our company with the investment community in my new role.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rich Hanson, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our operational performance in our businesses other than WRECO.", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Dan. At this time last year, we predicted that our Wood Products business would experience significant losses due to weak market conditions, but we didn't foresee the historic downturn that haunted 2007. Even the most pessimistic projections didn't anticipate that prices for oriented strand board would drop more than 40% from levels in early 2006 or that when adjusted for inflation lumber would dip to depression era levels. So that's exactly what happened and the effect upon our earnings has been dramatic. We continue to report losses in our Wood Products business despite aggressive actions taken by Lee Alford and his management team. This includes closing 1.3 billion square feet of our oriented strand board capacity and curtailing other OSB mills. Taken together, the combination results in a curtailment of 38%. In addition, we have closed one of our three TimberStrand LSL mills and curtailed production at the remaining two. Similarly in 2007, our softwood lumber production declined by nearly 900 million board feet. In addition to these actions, we've taken aggressive steps to reduce costs if they weren't enough to offset the price and volume declines.", "We are continuing to further adjust production to match declining demand from our customers and minimize cash losses. Of course, there is significant cost associate with closing and curtailing a facility, but we've developed a process to make these decisions thoughtfully and quickly. We believe the long-term prospects for the North American residential homebuilding market are good due to favorable demographics and the economic outlook. Our high-level strategy, which we\u2019ve discussed before remains sound as indicated by our customer response and market penetration with higher value products and services. We have unique capabilities and proprietary technologies that give us the competitive advantage to bring value to the homebuilder.", "Also this quarter, we saw a deeper impact of the weak housing market on our Timberlands business. Our Western operations are a very dependent upon the California housing markets, which are being hit harder than other areas of the nation. As a result, lot prices dropped in the West while prices in the South were relatively stable. Our western operations also felt the fury of Mother Nature in early December when a series of snow, wind, and rainstorms slammed into Washington and Oregon. We experienced gusts reaching to 147 miles an hour while nearly 20 inches of rain saturated our PL [ph] Tree Farm in Washington over a 48-hour period. So we expect significant salvage and road and bridge repair cost to affect our Western Timberlands operations for several quarters.", "Notwithstanding the current challenging conditions, Timberlands are a unique asset with long-term value, which we maximized through our industry-leading cultural expertise. In addition to growing and harvesting timber, we are focused on developing other sources of income from these lands. This includes, as Steve mentioned, oil, gas, and mineral extraction, which has developed into a growing source of value, and biofuels such as the alliance we have now formed with Chevron will represent a future revenue source.", "Moving on to Containerboard, Packaging, we continue to improve this business while conducting our strategic review. By year-end, we had captured above 75% of the $40 per ton Containerboard price increase in box prices. For the year, these prices were nearly offset by cost increases predominantly in fiber and energy. We have now realized a $120 million of the $230 million improvement goal we committed to achieve by the end of 2008. Our continued focus on improving the performance in this business has resulted in improved margins each quarter during 2007. We also successfully implemented our programs to consolidate orders into more efficient manufacturing plants. This included selling our Cerritos, California site and moving customers into other Southern California locations. We also closed our Closter, New Jersey facility following a fire, and recently announced the closure of our Baltimore box plant. We\u2019ve repositioned the accounts served by those facilities into plants that have competitive advantage.", "As Dan mentioned, this business has benefited from the strength of the non-durable goods market and the weaker dollar. As a result, we saw containerboard shipments increased during the fourth quarter due to strong export demand.", "Meanwhile, we see encouraging market conditions for our Cellulose Fibers business with continued high demand and the weakening U.S. dollar. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, our pulp price realizations increased, shipment volumes climbed slightly, and cost for planned annual maintenance decline. Unfortunately, in the business higher chemical and energy costs offset those benefits. Meanwhile though, our five-mill Cellulose Fiber segment continues to make significant operational improvements. The industry efficiency index for these mills improved 2.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. As a result, this segment is poised to benefit fully from the strong markets in which it operates.", "Before I close my comments, I want to acknowledge that work our employees have done not only in improving operating performance, but in reducing our injury rate by 26% during 2007, making it the safest year in Weyerhaeuser history. And it is no surprise that there is a high correlation between safety and operational performance. We\u2019re positioned for the future, and I'm confident in the ability of our operations to perform well through the challenging conditions ahead.", "For a more detailed discussion on our first quarter outlook, I would like to turn the call over to Patty Bedient.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Rich, and good morning. Dan and Rich have provided the overall economic outlook for 2008. My comments will focus on first quarter 2008 compared to fourth quarter 2007. Then I'll wrap up with some summary comments about capital spending and other financial items.", "I will start with Timberlands. The impact of the continued weakness in the housing market is expected to result in the lower log sales volumes and prices in the West. In addition, the December storm event that Rich discussed will result in higher costs. We should have a positive price variance in the South due to a higher grade mix on slightly lower volume. We expect a lower level of non-strategic Timberlands sales in the first quarter. So overall, Timberlands earnings are anticipated to be lower in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.", "In Wood Products, we don't see any significant improvement in market conditions for the first quarter of 2008, and we expect to continue incurring substantial losses across our operations for reasons that Rich discussed. This could lead to even further production curtailments or mill closures. Our focus is on careful management of working capital and cost reduction.", "Cellulose Fibers, the economic outlook continues to be favorable, and liquid packaging prices are expected to increase in the first quarter. We will be taking more scheduled annual maintenance in the first quarter versus none in the fourth quarter. Because maintenance costs are charged in the quarter incurred, we expect our manufacturing cost to increase, also fiber and chemicals could increase. As a result, we anticipate first quarter 2008 earnings for this segment to be slightly below the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Packaging sales realizations are expected to rise in the first quarter due to seasonal mix improvement, mostly due to an increase in produce shipment. Overall Packaging shipments are expected to decline mainly as a result of exiting low margin business and from seasonally lower demand. We anticipate an increase in containerboard shipments due to strong offshore demand. Mill non-fiber manufacturing cost should decline, primarily due to increased production, as we have less planned maintenance downtime in the first quarter compared to the fourth. Prices for OCC and wood chips are expected to increase from fourth quarter level and are quite volatile today, 2008. Higher energy costs are anticipated due to seasonally higher prices and consumption of natural gas. Cornstarch and wax prices are also expected to further increase due to pressures from the ethanol and petroleum markets. As a result, we anticipate that earnings in the first quarter will be les than the fourth quarter.", "In our Real Estate business, the seasonal reduction in single-family closings and lower single-family margins are expected to result in a loss in this segment. We expect margins will continue to be negatively impacted due to excess home inventories, competitive price discounts, and sales incentives. We do not anticipate any significant land or lot sales in the first quarter of 2008.", "Weyerhaeuser Company had capital expenditures of approximately $700 million in 2007. We expect to reduce capital spending in 2008 to approximately $550 million. During the year, we completed our 18 million share repurchase authorization, with total share repurchases in 2007 of 7 million shares. In addition, through the Domtar transaction, we retired over 25 million shares early in 2007. Our shares outstanding at year-end were 211 million. As of year-end, we had $1.8 billion available under our $2.2 billion of committed bank facilities. During the fourth quarter, a favorable decision in the Paragon Trade Brands litigation enabled us to cancel 500 million of appeal bonds.", "Our net debt to total capitalization ratio is just over 39% versus our target of 30% to 40%. Excluding discontinued operations, our general and administrative costs for 2007 were $130 million lower than 2006. While the uncertain conditions that face us from an economic standpoint will be challenging, we believe we are well positioned to weather the storm, given our intense focus on cost control, working capital, and overall cash flow.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathy to begin our question-and-answer session.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Patty. Mary, would you please open the line for questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from George Staphos with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks, everyone. Good morning, and congratulations to Dan and everyone on the additional responsibility. Well, I guess the first questions I had were boxes on containerboard, can you remind us when you expect to get full implementation on the containerboard price like through boxes? Do you expect that that will happen by the first quarter with the lag we just associate with national account business, etcetera?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, this is Rich. I'll take that one, George.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Hi, Rich.", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "As I mentioned, we believe we have realized in the range of 75% and looking at the accounts that are still open in the first quarter, we should virtually complete it. There is a little bit of business still on into the year, but for the most part we will have it completed.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And just in general, in terms of box trends and what you're seeing in terms of consumption through the first portion of 2008, realizing that the export markets are quite strong and that's a positive, what do you think in terms of box consumption domestically?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, I mean aside from the comment we made about seasonal differences in the first quarter, we're seeing pretty strong markets, we are seeing good takeaway, and market conditions really are pretty good in this business. The inventories are tight, our customers\u2019 demand is solid. So conditions are very good.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. So that\u2019s a the year-on-year increase or can you put numbers on that?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Question again, George.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "The question is, I know it's good takeaway, but could you put some percentages or parameters, are you up 2%, 5%, down through, what's good in your estimation at this juncture realizing it's early in the year?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Patty made the comment we will be off slightly seasonally. But we have done a lot of repositioning. We are not looking really at volume growth in that respect, but the markets should allow for volume growth through that, but as we\u2019ve repositioned we are focused on the higher margin business.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. A few strategic questions and I will turn it over [inaudible]. In Containerboard in terms of the strategic review and really the interest that you're getting from other parties, you said you have been pleased both with the interest level and the number of options. Are you surprised with the interest and options that you're seeing at present related to maybe what your expectations would have been six months ago or is it pretty much as you would have expected? And then, within Wood Products, realizing that you run the businesses that you own for the longer-term, is the outlook in the performance perhaps raising questions as you look at the longer-term returns in that business relative to what you would have thought it could generate several months ago and it fits within the portfolio as a result? Thanks, guys.", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Okay. With regard to the Containerboard, Packaging strategic review, George, we did say that we're pleased with the response and the progress that we're making to date in our review. So I would say, we weren't totally surprised by the response, but we're pleased with the response that various parties have given us. So we look forward to concluding that process.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, and on Wood?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "On Wood Products for the longer term, I think we have well introduced to all of you the eye level strategy of moving our Wood Products into the structural frame of a home. That is a process of penetration that is continuing even as we are entering into this downturn, and our expectations for that business and our optimism is high that the penetration will continue to increase and of course we consider that to be more profitable business for the company.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "The next question comes form Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Hi, Just curious, your guidance in timber is fewer non-strategic land sales. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much you had in the fourth quarter? Hello?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Gail, this is Patty. We typically don't break that out separately. They are lumpy and from a seasonal perspective we would expect to be down in the first quarter compared to the fourth.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. And can you talk about your view on OCC moving into 2008? I know obviously that you expect it to be up and volatile in the first quarter, but just in general how you see the pressures in the market playing out versus I guess overseas demand and shipping capacity and everything else?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, this is Rich. I believe we have said before, we see continuing pressure on OCC, especially because of the offshore demand in China, and we really don't see much relief there. It's a question of how much more might arise.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. And do you see any issues relating to the Containerboard business, either in terms of OCC or your export business in terms of the shipping capacity?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "No, we haven't experienced that.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Just to talk about the homebuilding business for a second, given your backlogs and what you're seeing in the market with regards to traffic in your expectations for the starts in your homebuilding segment, how do you see the closings progressing through 2008?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, as you can see from our numbers our backlog is down as we go into the year and I think that is consistent with really the entire industry. On a year-over-year basis, as we look at '08 versus '07, we expect volumes to be down modestly. Each of our markets happened to be in a different phase in the cycle. We've talked about that in the past. So we\u2026 as I noted we expect to see some slowdown in the Northwest and in Texas. As we go through the year, I think first quarter will be soft, Richard, but we expect to see more recovery from the back half of the year, probably starting with the Washington DC market, which entered the downturn earlier.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Then sort of following on that, as you look at the level of housing starts where we are now your level of profitability in wood, what sort of housing start level do you think you need to see generally speaking to see the Wood business get back to levels of profitability or prices and volumes sort of normalize, what kind of level of housing starts would you need to see?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "I will take a stab at that, Richard. Long-term we have a view over the next ten years that the economy should average total starts of about 1.9 million a year over the cycle. So we overbuilt that '04, '05, '06. Now, we are going through a correction period. Our view is that it will as I say be softer in '08 and '07, start to pull out of this in '09, and hopefully start to get back on track in 2010. Our relative profitability is going to depend quite a bit on the competitive environment. We think we've got a strong set of assets both in our homebuilding operations and in our Wood Products manufacturing. We expect to see some competitors disappear in this cycle, and I think we certainly expect to pick up share, but I couldn't give you a number of starts and correlate that to a particular level of profitability.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "That's helpful. Just to clarify, as you think about your housing segment, thinking about the inflation point being sort of 2009 at some point and then improving into 2010, is that what you said Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "That's what I'm expecting. We've lots of opinions on that one, and as I say it is very, very regional, and so what would impact our wood product business is really national starts would impact our WRECO business. It is down to a more granular region-by-region focus, and my view is that we are going to start to see some stabilization towards the end of this year and I would not expect a very dramatic rebound, but I think one that will be much gradual.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question come from Mark Connelly with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. This is Hamza Mizari [ph]. Just a couple of questions.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "I am sorry. We are having trouble hearing you, Hamza.", "Unidentified Analyst - Credit Suisse", "Hi, is that better?", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Yes, it is. Thank you.", "Unidentified Analyst - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Just a couple of questions, do you expect there to be much more international repositioning of your business?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "This is Steve. On our strategies, as we look forward we have specifically indicated South America the center of activities this year of '08 for our timber business and solid wood converting for South American and world markets. That would be the major thrust over the next couple or three years, strategically for us on the international scene.", "Unidentified Analyst - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Got you. And you've always have been through a number of downturns in the past. How much flexibility is there in your system to take out further cost short of closing down sawmills permanently?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That is a constant effort that we undertake to remove costs from our system. Certainly, when you take a shutdown, you have ongoing costs that are quite high, particularly in some regions of North America. But we are working within the constraints of capital to constantly improve our manufacturing costs. And I think you heard in Richard's presentation today about several sawmills that we are rebuilding and should position us when we come out of the downturn for much better competitive positioning.", "Unidentified Analyst - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Last question. In Containerboard, you talk about exiting low-margin business. Can you give us a sense of the sorts of businesses\u2026 the sort of business you decided to walk away from? Is there a regional product or geographical trend in that decision?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, within the segments that we have there is a range of margins available to us, but\u2026 I will just take an example of fast\u2026 what we call a fast-moving consumer goods business, which is food and beverage, beer, and soft drinks, etcetera. That's a very tough competitive business. And so we have been pretty selective about where we want to be within that business. And as we have closed some operating units, some of our box plants, we have tended to transition really only about 75% of the business from those plants to the remaining plants and that is a selection process we have been going through. It has been very successful with very little surprise in terms of lost accounts that we wanted to keep.", "Unidentified Analyst - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Got you. Thank you very much. That's it.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Good morning. Dan, I have got a couple of questions on Real Estate kicking off. Is it possible for you to give us a little color on where the real estate write-downs took place and also where you have been selling land in real estate within this segment?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Sure. Mark, this is Dan. I'm going to take the second question first. The significant land sale that we had in the fourth quarter was sale of a commercial zoned property in the San Diego market, and we have talked about our land sales before. It's an ongoing part of our business. We continue to remind you that it\u2019s lumpy, we use that term. But on average, non-single family revenues end up averaging 88% to 92% of our total revenues. Last year I think we came in at 88%.", "With respect to impairments, we took impairments in the fourth quarter in the Phoenix marketplace, in Las Vegas, in Southern California, in the Pacific Northwest, in Washington D.C. We review our portfolio on a routine basis. We react to competitive pressures in the market in terms of pricing and competition, and we continue to evaluate our strategy with respect to every piece of property. But the majority of the impairments in Q4 came out of the Phoenix market.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, right. The next question I had was on the Timberlands. I think Rich Hanson mentioned that some of these cleanup costs were going to continue over the next several quarters. And I wondered if it's possible to kind of quantify the magnitude of those cleanup costs and exactly how long you think they may run?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Okay, well, of course, we are still assessing that. But giving you an example, we have roads that have been destroyed that we will to rebuild to access the timber and then we have to salvage the timber that's blown down, and\u2026 so that the logging costs to do that are going to be higher than normal logging cost. We estimate that it will take us more than a year to work our through this. So it's going to be spread out over several quarters. And I suppose if you think about it in any one quarter, it is not material. So that's the best answer I can give you at this point. I think you saw the book write-off, but that doesn't address the operating cost in front of those.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "So there is no way\u2026 what you are saying though is that increase in the operating cost is not a material number in any quarter in terms of the results of this business?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "No.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. All right. And then, the next question I had was on the Wood Products business, I was just kind of curious. You talked about pricing being down at these depression era levels and this is in spite of the Canadian dollar being at its highest levels since World War II. It would seem like with so much of our wood coming from Canada that that high Canadian dollar would put a little floor under wood prices?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, I would say in any kind of normal market swings you would be right, but these are extraordinary swings. I think you heard the comment about the reduction in supply there, demand requirements of over 15 billion board feet of capacity. I guess my response will be it\u2019s not enough. You saw what we did, took out close to a billion feet of capacity as we tried to move and stay in front of this. So, the best answer I can give you is it's not enough.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. The last question I had is on the Packaging business. It sounded like you're moving away from a lot of high volume kind of consumer beverage, consumer food, consumer products business. And if I think back just 4, 5 years ago, what I heard you talk about was trying to grow the type of business, the feeds in the big boxes. I think you were pretty aggressive about lining up some contracts with big volume consumer goods companies. Can you just talk about kind of what's led the kind of a change in view on this strategy?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, fair enough. I mean we need to be competitive in national account business. There has been a lot of consolidation in this business and it\u2019s been very competitive and you better have good logistics and good low-cost systems to serve that market. But even as I mentioned, within that there are pieces of it that are better than others. So I don't mean to save we're exiting that market, we're just being a lot more selective of where our system matches up to the accounts that are available, and we have a logistics advantage or a particular quality capability that's needed. So we won't be exiting that market. We're just going to be more selective within it, because at our scale we should be able to be competitive in that market over time and we are.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, very good. Thanks, Rich. Good luck.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Yes, good morning. My question has to do with I guess more of the time clock here. With this year being an election year, we saw how quickly that Congress moved on the stimulus package and\u2026 I guess I'm just little concerned that you be in the only major seed [ph] corporation left, I think there one in Arkansas that owns timberland, and it looks like that risks to you taking advantage of the options out there are actually getting higher in terms of avoiding tax down the road. Can you comment sort of on the sense of urgency with your restructuring?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Chip, this is Steve. Our Board and our management team are working very diligently on the Containerboard, Packaging process, and I expect that we'll be moving very smartly along to a decision on it. We have a number of options to look at and review, and the Board is prepared and has been very active and involved in that decision making process.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Okay. And respecting that, I know that you can\u2019t and shouldn't say much about that in particular, but when you look more to the broader issue of the timber taxability, it seems like the TREE Act will solve maybe a third of the issue if you consider the 2011 tax rates that the law currently has for individuals. And given that, are you comfortable that\u2026 and also given that you never know what a new Congress could do in 2009, are you comfortable that you can achieve your goals by then, whatever those goals might be, to ultimately result in the timberland being more, as I was saying, in a more tax favored status like just about every other acre is in this country?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Chip, first with regard to the TREE Act, we are very optimistic of getting that passed this year. As you probably know, it's in the Farm Bill and now that the stimulus packages has been passed, Congress is going to do more focus on that bill. So we're optimistic of achieving that, but with the tax relief package or without it all the actions that we are taking today leave us completely open for consideration of any future form of incorporation of the company or direction we might take. The TREE Act itself, once enacted, is certainly I think you are inferring it's a one-year package, but our expectation is it would go into the extenders and be renewed on an annual basis along with many, many other tax relief packages.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Next question comes from Don Roberts with CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.", "Don Roberts - CIBC World Markets", "Thank you. Steve, two strategic questions, I guess the first one, when we talk about the further growth in the Timberlands side in South America, I'm just wondering how challenging it's going to be to implement that in the face\u2026 at least, profitably in the face of rising land costs in South America? You certainly see it in Brazil. I was just wondering if you can give us more color, you see specifically in Uruguay on that challenge?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, certainly, Uruguay has been discovered, and we have competitors who are working on their own land base, but to this point in time and just as recently as this first quarter, we still find land\u2026 bare land and land that has already been planted that are at prices that can give us a comfortable return and a return that takes into account all the aspects of operating in a different part of the world. So we are optimistic at this stage that we can continue to build the land base. Of course, if things start to runaway we have to pull in our horns.", "Don Roberts - CIBC World Markets", "Okay. This is the second I guess the strategic issue is this is only announced sale of the Commercial Construction Sales business. I'm just wondering, what's the strategic relationship really with the Trus Joist franchise and what implications of getting rid of this as it is for that franchise?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "This is Rich. This commercial beam business is open beam\u2026 open Trus business that has been around out a long time. It is not central to our strategy to focus on the residential housing framing market. It's a small business with three locations. And we just felt that at this point it is better to monetize that business and focus where our basic strategy is.", "Don Roberts - CIBC World Markets", "Okay. So, no implications really for the Trus Joist in terms of other potential divestitures?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "No, not at all.", "Don Roberts - CIBC World Markets", "Good, okay. Thank you.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Thank you. First, Steve, I'm curious whether or not overall company performance and obviously, the difficulties in the homebuilding and the wood products area currently, if that has any bearing on the way you think about the containerboard sale process, or are you able to look at that as a wholly distinct from the performance in the non-containerboard businesses?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think the way we look at it is over a longer period of time strategically. And as we evaluate what the make-up of the company is going forward, we've looked at with containerboard in, as well as all the other businesses. So our view is the containerboard process that is going on today is the right review at the right time.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And so there are no, from\u2026 I should come away thinking that there are no timing related issues that weakness in other businesses would create as you assess what you want to do longer term for containerboard, is that right?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think that, as we look for the longer term, that is correct, you are looking more at a short-term cash burn, I think.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And second, on a whole different note, in the real estate biz or the homebuilder has indicated that you were going to likely lose money in the first quarter. I guess I'm trying to understand if\u2026 how much of that is seasonal, if at all, or another way to put at it, if the current level of business activity were to persist through the year would you expect to continue to be losing money in that business or is there a significant seasonal element that would suggest that even at these levels of business activity, in other quarters you would more likely be making money?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "It is a combination Mark. This is Dan. First quarter is seasonably slower in terms of deliveries, as you know, we end up delivering a lot of homes in the back half of the year and as we go into the New Year we got a low backlog, but normally we have slower deliveries and so it's generally a softer quarter. We expect the business to be challenged throughout 08 with slightly lower volumes throughout the year and we expect margins, as I commented, to be under pressure throughout the year even as compared to 2007. You\u2019ve noted that we always have some level of land sales and we expect to replicate that during the year, but I'd\u2026 we had had no plans for land sales in Q1, and I comment\u2026 I can't comment on when they might occur in the balance of the year. But our view of the year, generally, is it's going to be tougher than '07.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for bringing up the land sales, because I just wanted to clarify, I wasn't quite sure. You had mentioned something about 88% or 90% of something. I wasn't quite sure. If you could just over again what land sales have historically run at?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Land sales, well, conversely, the 88% to 92% is the percentage of revenues coming from single-family operations.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "So it's run to the\u2026 slightly\u2026 almost half of the revenues of the business?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "No, no, no. Single family, 88% to 92 % of total WRECO revenues come from single family.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Got it. Okay, thank you.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "But in any given quarter, that number may move a bit depending upon the size of the land transaction.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "So included in the land would be routine sale of lots. We are land developers, selling to third-party builders as well as what we would call some non-strategic land, such as the land that we sold in Q4, which was zoned for commercial use.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Great. And then very quickly lastly, on the write-down, I realize that most of it was related to the Phoenix acquisition, but on the remainder, are you writing down finished homes, you're writing down homes in process, or are you writing down raw land, or is that heavily weighted to one or the other of those categories?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President, Weyerhaeuser Company; President and CEO, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "It is heavily weighted to projects that are in process, where we evaluate the impact of changing pricing. In some cases it may be related to just the land position, but normally that's related to a housing project that's under way. It could be that we are building homes, it could be we are actually in the land development phase, but it's a routine evaluation of the project economics that causes to have to impair if we see prices declining significantly.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Thank you.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Next question comes from Claudia Hueston with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan", "Hi. Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been asked. But I just had two housekeeping issues. One, if you could just give some guidance around the tax rate expected for 2008. And then secondly, I was wondering if you might be able to quantify the impact of the maintenance you expect in cellulose fiber business in the first quarter, and then maybe the impact that you had in the packaging business in the fourth quarter, so as to know what to expect going forward? Thanks.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I'll take the first one, Claudia as it relates to the tax rate on a go forward basis, we are looking at 34% to 35% for the tax rate for 2008.", "Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan", "Thanks.", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. And your question was the impact of maintenance\u2026 the downtime in cellulose fibers?", "Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan", "Yes, please.", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "In the quarter ahead?", "Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan", "Yes.", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well, there will be additional maintenance, it's primarily related to Longview operations. Then if you move over to Containerboard Packaging, it will be less maintenance downtime. We had significant plant maintenance downtime in the fourth quarter in Containerboard Packaging related to the first quarter.", "Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. I think in the press release you go through what the maintenance expenses were last year in each of the quarters. Is that a pretty decent guide to be using just going forward as we think about maintenance in the quarters?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "They tend to follow the same pattern quarter-by-quarter.", "Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Next questions come from Peter Ruschmeier with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I was hoping to come back to your comments about being pleased with the level of interest and range of options for containerboard, and if I read between the lines, I guess I would interpret that to mean that you've got lots of options, you're not prepared to tell us what you might do yet, but that you plan to take some action, or previously, I think you'd indicated that one-year options was simply to retain the business. And so I guess, to ask differently, given that you have good interest, given you have a good range of options, can we\u2026 is it fair for me to rule out one of these options of retaining this business going forward, or asked differently, under what conditions might should be better off if the decision was in fact to retain the business?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Pete, first of all, options are still on the table. So we haven't cleared one off. And I would also say on the option of retention, that business group is progressing very well on improving the operational performance of the business and we are pleased by that, but I'm not in a position to speak for the Board today on what options we favor or what direction we might take. We obviously take into account all of our long-term strategic views of things and of course we're mindful of the short-term as well. But there are no options off the table.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And a quick question for Patty, if I could. I believe your over funded pension balance last year was 843 million for 2006, do you have an updated figure for us for 2007?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It will be significantly above that at the end of the year-end, closer to the $2 billion level.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "To $2 billion?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "And can you help us to reconcile the --?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It\u2019s closer to $2 million. Pete, I don't have the exact number.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "No, I understand. But if it\u2019s up over $1 billion, can you help us to understand how much of that maybe was planned performance versus discount rate assumptions et cetera, I mean, what accounts for such a large sequential increase?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Most of it is planned performance.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. That's helpful. Lastly, I wanted to come back if I could to\u2026 I think it was Mark Wilde was asking about lumber prices and I want to ask the same question, I guess in the context of the US-Canadian Trade Agreement, which some thought at one point in time that would support a higher floor prices for lumber, if a third of our consumption is coming from Canada and we probably got the lowest lumber prices in Canadian dollars since the 60s or prior. Is there something going wrong with the US-Canadian trade agreement or asked differently, what impact on markets do you think the agreement is having through this downturn?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, this is Rich. It's probably a longer discussion with the economists that really are analyzing this thing in-depth, but again I would say there has been a tremendous amount of capacity go down in Canada and it is continuing, I mean, it is real blood bath at Canada. But again, this has just been an extraordinary drop in demand for lumber and it hasn't been enough and as I mentioned in my comments, as we look forward and we look at this continuing housing situations there will be more closures and so I think, it's just a fact that it's deeper and more rapid than anyone anticipated. I don't think it has much to do with the agreement and the Canadian mills are significantly disadvantaged.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "We believe we have time for one more question, Mary.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from Ross Gilardi with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Thanks a lot. Steve, I was just wondering what impact did falling prices have on Timberland valuations, if any, particularly in the Pacific Northwest? And then, late on that, are you seeing significant enough timber harvesting deferrals to prevent sawlog prices from falling much further?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The falling prices or stoppage, it certainly would indicate that prices for Timberland would [inaudible], but again people evaluate these things over the long-term and normally bid a price that supports our long-term deal with the market. Having said that, I am not aware of any big Timberland sales that are taking place during the current time. With regard to your second question, I think, I'll defer to Rich on the timber question.", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Would you restate the second part again?", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "I\u2019m wondering if you are seeing enough in terms of other companies deferring their timber harvest to prevent sawlog prices from falling much further in the Pacific Northwest?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. Well, it has been deferential in South as compared to the West, and I mentioned that in my comments. So in the South, we have a much heavier proportion of the ownership in small private landowners. There has been a pullback that seems to have firmed up sawlog prices more than in the West. We are now seeing pullbacks in harvest in the West, and in our own case we will continue to look at that. We are certainly not going to harvest into a weakening market and depress values even more. So I think, you are probably seeing on the front edge of it now in the West adjustments and pullbacks.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then if I could just ask one final question on Containerboards, it's clear you are still exploring several different alternatives. I am just wondering, is tax-free spin-off a viable alternative if you decided not to hold, sell or merge the business?", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Certainly, that is an option that we can consider amongst all the options we have, but at this stage we are not prepared to talk about any specific options.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Steven R. Rogel - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you for joining us this morning. And I will be available in my office for additional questions in probably about half an hour. Thank you. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Weyerhaeuser 2007 fourth quarter earnings conference call.

Welcome to the Weyerhaeuser 2008 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded Friday, May 02, 2008.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you, Eric. Good morning. Welcome to Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. I'm Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Dan Fulton, President and CEO; Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer; Rich Hanson, Chief Operating Officer and Larry Burrows, President of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.", "The call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release and material for this call can be found at the website or by contacting April Myer at 253-924-2937. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.", "This morning Weyerhaeuser reported a first quarter 2008 net loss of $148 million or $0.70 per diluted share, a net sale of $3.4 billion. The first quarter includes the following after tax items: a charge of $40 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the closure of wood product facility and one box plant, a charge of $35 million or $0.17 per diluted share for real estate company asset impairment and a reserve, a charge of $11 million or $0.05 per diluted share for a litigation reserve, a charge of $11 million or $0.05 per diluted share to adjust environmental reserves related to closed facility. Excluding these items, Weyerhaeuser's net loss was $51 million or $0.24 per diluted share.", "A GAAP reconciliation of special items is available at our website in the earnings information package.", "Please turn to chart 4 in the earnings information package as I will next discuss the waterfall chart. Chart 4 is a bar chart detailing the changes in earnings per share on a segment basis from fourth quarter 2007 to first quarter 2008. As noted in the first bar on chart 4, Q4 2007 earnings before special items was $0.42 per share. Quarter-to-quarter changes and corporate earnings were as solid and will be proceeding from left to right across the waterfall chart beginning with the timberland segment.", "Fewer non-strategic land sales reduced timberland earnings by $0.05 per share. Lower wood products prices were offset by the clients in log costs and reduced sales and distribution cost, resulting in a $0.02 per share contribution to earnings from Q4 in wood products segment.", "Cellulose fibers earnings were lower by $0.07 per share. Higher price realizations were more than offset by cost associated with an annual scheduled maintenance outage at a primary mill and increased energy, chemical and fiber costs. Containerboard, packaging and recycling earnings were $0.02 per share lower. Modestly higher packaging prices were offset by seasonally lower shipment volumes and higher fiber transportation and energy costs.", "Real estate earnings were $0.49 per share lower than in Q4. Primarily, this was due to no land sales or lot sales during the first quarter. The price of homes closed was 16% lower and there were fewer closings in the seasonally strong fourth quarter.", "Lastly, corporate and other were $0.05 per share lower, due to tax-related variance.", "The final bar to the right of the page is the first quarter 2008 loss before special items of $0.24 per share.", "I will now turn the call over to Dan. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Kathy. Before beginning today, I'd like to borrow from the vernacular of baseball and announce some changes in our lineup for this call. I'll begin with someone who is not on this call for the first time in more than a decade, Steve Rogel. As you know, Steve retired as CEO after our annual shareholder meeting, as part of the culmination of succession planning that he undertook shortly after joining Weyerhaeuser.", "From day one, he viewed the identification and preparation of the next set of leaders as an important component of his role as Weyerhaeuser CEO. He leaves me with a roster of top flight leaders, all uniquely qualified to unlock the potential of our business portfolio. Speaking on behalf of all of us who have worked with Steve on a daily basis, we thank him for sharing his industry knowledge, business savvy and sound counsel. All of us are better managers and stewards of our shareholders investment in Weyerhaeuser, because of his mentoring.", "At the Board's request, Steve agreed to delay his retirement in order to continue to guide important initiatives. One of the most significant was the strategic review of our containerboard, packaging and recycling business. This review culminated in our recently announced decision to sell the business to International Paper for $6 billion.", "Additionally, I want to recognize Steve's long-term commitment to improving workplace safety across Weyerhaeuser. In Steve's final quarter as our CEO, we achieved the safest operating conditions in the history of the company. In his ongoing role as Chairman of our Board, Steve will remain a critical force in steering the future course of Weyerhaeuser. I personally look forward to continuing my working relationship with Steve knowing that I can rely on his counsel as we make further changes to Weyerhaeuser to maximize shareholder returns.", "I'd also like to acknowledge a new addition to the line-up on today's call. For the first time, Larry Burrows joins us as the new President of WRECO. Larry is a 32-year veteran of the real estate business. He joined our Winchester Homes' subsidiary in 1989 and served as President of Winchester from 2003 until assuming his current position.", "I have worked with Larry for many years and I know that he is a proven leader with the experience necessary to guide WRECO through these tough market conditions. As a member of our senior management team, Larry will also play a key role in Weyerhaeuser direction setting.", "Before turning to current market conditions and the steps we are taking to position Weyerhaeuser in light of these challenges, I want to update you on two significant events. The first activity is an update of our active support for forest products industries ongoing tax reform efforts. Bipartisan support for this legislation continues to be strong and is growing. As you know, the Tree Act is in the Senate passed Farm Bill. Conference negotiations are well underway in the Farm Bill and were told that the Tree Acts inclusion in the final Farm Bill agreement is under serious consideration. We continue to work with the industry and Congress to seek passage of the Tree Activity, which will provide immediate value to shareholders and is compatible with many different business strategies.", "The second significant area of activity over the past months involves the work being undertaken to transition our containerboard, packaging and recycling business to IT. Transition teams from both companies are in place and we've submitted the agreement to the Department of Justice for review. Both companies remain focused on finalizing the transaction in the first... in the third quarter.", "I would like to acknowledge the focus and dedication of our employees in this business. As Rich Hanson will outline, this team produced outstanding results during very uncertain times. It may be ongoing needs of customers that met the ongoing needs of customers during the strategic review process and subsequent sale announcement while continuing to improve the operational performance of this business.", "Turning now to first quarter market conditions, the protracted recession in the housing market has had a devastating impact on our first quarter performance. We've gone from the market with 1.7 U.S. single-family housing starts in 2005 to today's rate of approximately 680,000. We saw evidence of this slowdown first in our wood products business in 2005 and then WRECO beginning last year.", "As reported last week, new home sales in March were at their lowest levels in 16 years. There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty in the financial markets supporting residential construction and sales even as regulators search for solutions to help stabilize the current situation. Excessive levels of inventory affect both sales of homes as well as new starts. Like others, we believe these factors will continue to put downward pressure on the housing market and by extension, wood products. Although it appears that prices for lumber and OSB may have hit bottom, there's still ways to go before the significant increase in demand.", "The lone bright spot in the economy to our portfolio is the benefit we're seeing from the declining value of the U.S. dollar. As a result, prices for our pulp are becoming increasingly competitive compared to those based on the euro and the Canadian dollar. We can't control economic conditions. Our focus is on controlling what we can by improving our operating position in the context of this challenging environment. This includes curtailments, permanent shutdowns and sales of non-core assets. We also must dramatically reduce overhead and support costs to align with the more focused company that we are creating. I am committed to making this happen.", "Over the past several years, you have seen us review our portfolio with a critical eye to enhance our ability to deliver shareholder value. By divesting our fine paper and packaging businesses, we've said that we understand that our future is not defined by our past. In the future, we'll continue with an increased sense of urgency demanded by current market conditions. The major moves we've already made allow us to be more nimble in executing any additional adjustments to our portfolio.", "Trees define us and our Timberlands business is at our core. Other businesses must compliment our Timberlands holdings and manufacturing will be done only where we have the technology, unique skill opportunity or competitive advantage and most importantly, the ability to do so in a capital efficient manner.", "Today's results are sobering, but we've weathered similar business cycles before. In my years with the company, I have seen that the best path lies and driving forward with purpose and conviction and we're doing that again. In the process we are creating a great future, a future that I am excited about. I look forward to our upcoming Analyst Meeting on May 30, in New York in order to continue the conversation.", "And now, I would like to turn the call over to Rich Hanson, our Chief Operating Officer.", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, Dan. During my presentation this morning, I will reference several supporting charts that we posted in the Investor Section of our website. While it's not imperative to see the slides during my discussion you can find them by clicking the link to our webcast of today's call. To help you follow me, I'll reference the chart number as I start a new section.", "Before discussing our first quarter performance though I want to expand briefly on Dan's comment about our safety performance. For the first time in our company's history, we achieved a recordable incident rate of less than one. As one of the first safety champions here at Weyerhaeuser, I am extremely proud of this achievement and as the Chief Operating Officer I recognize that safer conditions translate directly into more efficient operations, which is critical when markets are as tough as they are.", "I will begin today's review of our operating performance with the business where it all starts, Timberlands. For those of you following the slides, this is chart 5. The sluggish housing market that Dan discussed affected our Timberland's business in the first quarter. This was particularly true in the west, where much of our harvest goes to products used by the California housing market. As a result of the significant slowdown in building in California, lower demand for logs dragged down prices in the west. We still command premium prices for our export logs, but market factors are pressuring us to lower those prices to be inline with domestic levels.", "The south remains strong, where we saw realizations actually increased as more Wood Products mills take downtime in response to market conditions; the region is experiencing a shortage of wood chips. This resulted in higher prices for fiber logs, which led to the higher realizations. Our log inventories increased during the quarter. This was primarily due to the beginning of our salvage operations to harvest trees damaged by December's wind storms in the west. To avoid the degradation of the wood, we're quickly salvaging as much as possible. The recently implemented Russian log tariff has allowed us to increase our flow of logs to our Korean customer base.", "Moving to Wood Products, I will direct your attention to chart 6 and 7. There's little doubt that we have extremely challenging market right now. Dan mentioned that we think we've seen prices start to stabilize, but demand remains very weak. Lumber shipments dropped 12% during the quarter, while oriented strand board declined 15%. In response, our Wood Products management team has aggressively reduced our production levels.", "Since the market peaked in early 2006, we have curtailed or announced the curtailment of nearly half of our OSB and engineered lumber capacity. In addition, we have taken nearly 30% of our lumber capacity out of production. These are significant reductions, and we're prepared to take further action if necessary to lower demand... to meet lower demand, I should say. We also continue to position this business for the eventual market rebound by completing the sale of our first [indiscernible] European business and several U.S. distribution locations.", "Next, I will discuss two businesses that performed well during the first quarter. I'll start with cellulose fibers, which is represented by chart 8. The performance of this segment was highlighted by outstanding operating performance and stronger prices. This resulted in higher price realizations of $37 per ton. As you know, roughly two-thirds of our pulp is fluff grade that's used in absorbent products, a market that generally has commanded higher prices. This was offset, however, by lower volumes, additional costs associated with plant maintenance and higher costs for energy, chemicals, and fiber. Virtually, all the decline in shipments resulted from the expiration at the end of the year of the brokerage agreement that we had with Domtar. The planned maintenance was for our Longview liquid packaging board mill which was down for eleven days.", "I'll close today with a discussion of our containerboard packaging and recycling business. Information for this segment is on charts 9 and 10. Realizations for packaging improved nearly 1% as we captured a full quarter of the price increases that began last year. We also benefited from the improved mix that resulted from our work to rationalize low-margin accounts.", "In addition, an increase in containerboard shipments partially offset the seasonal decline in packaging shipments. Box price realizations improved compared with the same time last year. In addition, weekly shipment volumes were higher despite the selective closure of box plants resulting from the rationalization of low margin accounts over the past year. Non-fiber unit cost declined $16 million compared with the first quarter last year, due to productivity improvements and cost reduction over the past year. This was a significant improvement during a period of rising chemical and natural gas prices.", "Overall, this business delivered a solid performance given the distractions caused by the strategic review that resulted in the amount sales of these assets to International Paper. I join Dan in commending the people in containerboard packaging and recycling for their focus and dedication.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Burrows, who will discuss our real estate business. Larry?", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Thank you, Rich. For your reference, WRECO's statistical highlights are included in the Investors section of our website on chart 11. Housing markets continue to struggle; the industry's spring selling season has not really materialized. This is normally the time of year when prospective home buyers are most active in the market requiring constructions spring and summer where homes to be delivered later in the year.", "Excess inventories of both new and existing homes plagued most markets as a result of today's depressed sales. There is approximately an 11 month supply of unsold new home inventory with nearly a 10 month supply of unsold existing home inventory. Declining home prices are now evident in every major market.", "Price discounting on sales of new homes is also prevalent in each of our markets as builders compete for a limited pool of buyers. While price decline and favorable interest rates have benefited housing affordability, the tightening of mortgage underwriting criteria has constrained demand, particularly at lower price points.", "We continue to respond to this difficult environment as follows. First, reducing the amount of land acquisition. Virtually, every land acquisition obligation has been re-underwritten to reflect expected market conditions, the resulting outcome being a modified purchase price in terms or a forfeited contract deposit. Second, balancing land development expenditures with the reduced forecast for closings. Third; decreasing unsold inventory, fourth; adjusting staffing to the current level of market activity, fifth; substituting smaller and less expensive homes.", "Let me briefly describe conditions in our individual markets. Las Vegas, Phoenix, and the Inland Empire region of Southern California remain our weakest markets characterized by excess inventory and increasingly hampered by foreclosure activities.", "The San Diego market continues to support new home sales in well located closing communities, although the market is far from risks. Market activity in suburban Washington DC is below trend, functioning at the same slow seasonal pace evident for several quarters.", "As we anticipated, robust sales in the Houston and Puget Sound markets moderated in the first quarter. Traffic and sales declined on a year-over-year basis and price concessions increased in frequency. Reduced sales has decreased our single-family homes sold but not closed, what we call our backlog to approximately four month sales. Our builders finance subsidiary, WRI is an investor and an investment manager. The principal sources of funding are institutional investors for whom WRI performs investment management services. The first quarter's $19 million charge reflects impairments on investment activity and a reserve to true-up investment management fee obligations.", "Residential land markets remain iliquid with few reports of sales transactions. In the early stages of this cycle, land values were resilient despite weak housing markets. As the downturn extends, major home builders continue to report significant impairments. These impairments translate to lower sales prices. Lower sales prices may force a compensating pricing reduction in our neighboring communities to remain competitive.", "As an operating discipline, we routinely reevaluate our land pipeline to gauge project profitability. Essentially, we re-underwrite our land under control for current and expected market conditions. This re-evaluation process is the basis for the impairment charges recognized in our results of operations.", "Weak demand, excess supply and stiffening mortgage underwriting standards make the outlook for housing over the balance of 2008 exceptionally difficult. We believe that the markets will stabilize when the following trends occur. First, buyers regain confidence that the new home they buy today will not be selling for less tomorrow. Second, new home buyers are able to sell their existing homes at a price that makes it worthwhile for them to sell. Third, contract cancellations return to historic levels in the 15% to 20% range. Fourth, large builders bring liquidity to the land markets to reinvestment and land values stabilize. Our local managers are seasoned and experienced. Their companies are well equipped to work through the near term and benefit as market stabilize in transition to recovery.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Patty Bedient to discuss our outlook for the second quarter.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Larry, and good morning. The collapse in the housing market will continue to adversely affect our second quarter earnings. Markets for cellulose fibers and our containerboard packaging businesses should remain favorable.", "I'll begin the outlook with Timberlands. In the west, the domestic log markets continue to be weak, due to very low lumber demand and prices, although they appear to be stabilizing. The export log prices were flat in April, while higher freight rates continue to put downward pressure on price. Favorable exchange rates offset this to some degree.", "Fee volume in the west, should be up in the second quarter compared to the first, as we continue to quickly recover blow-down from storm-damaged stands. In the south, the realizations for logs are expected to be up slightly quarter-to-quarter due to continued strong fiber demand.", "Fee volume will be down compared to the first quarter as Great Mills continue to reduce production. Logging costs will likely increase, mainly due to higher diesel fuel prices and higher salvage logging costs. Overall, we expect Timberlands earnings to decrease slightly in the second quarter, compared to the first.", "Wood Products market conditions are expected to remain difficult in quarter two with differing trends in realizations by product line. We expect modest increases for lumber and OSB and a decline in average realizations for engineered wood. Shipment volumes of softwood lumber and OSB are expected to continue to decrease in response to weak demand, while engineered wood volumes are expected to increase seasonally compared to the first quarter.", "Log costs are anticipated to decline and pricing for byproduct residual should remain strong. We continue to monitor working capital levels closely as we navigate these challenging markets. Losses for our Wood Products segment will continue to be significant in the second quarter, although they are expected to moderate from the first quarter levels.", "Packaging sales realizations and shipments are expected to increase, primarily due to seasonal improvements in the demand for produce. OCC costs will likely be higher, due to seasonal fluctuations caused by lower generation, coupled with continued strong demand from China. Ship costs are also expected to remain at the high levels of the first quarter.", "Energy costs will increase, due primarily to higher natural gas prices in the second quarter. We do expect to take additional scheduled annual maintenance downtime in the second quarter compared to the first, and this will result in lower production volume and higher maintenance spending as these costs are expensed as incurred.", "Excluding the impact of reduced depreciation, we expect second quarter earnings to be comparable to the first quarter. Depreciation was suspended in mid March because these assets are now accounted for as discontinued operation. Depreciation for the full quarter would have been roughly $70 million on an ongoing basis.", "Sales realization in Cellulose fibers are expected to increase slightly in the second quarter, due to the continued strong market. This will be offset by higher maintenance and supply costs as a result of additional scheduled annual maintenance outages in the second quarter.", "As Rich noted, the mills continue to improve their operating efficiency. However, because of the additional scheduled maintenance downtime, we expect that earnings in the second quarter will be just slightly lower than the first. Larry has already described the challenging markets for our home building businesses. As a result of the continuing weak demand, we expect that the second quarter results from single-family home building operations will be comparable to the first quarter loss of $22 million before considering the effect of any impairment that may be required.", "During the first quarter, Weyerhaeuser Company spent just over $100 million on capital expenditures. Given the current environment, we have deferred spending on capital projects that are not already well underway or essential for safety, environmental, or regulatory compliance. As a result, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be between $400 million and $450 million.", "In addition, we are conserving cash by restricting all discretionary spending. Net cash flows in the second quarter should be significantly stronger than the first. As previously announced, we anticipate using a substantial amount of the proceeds from our containerboard packaging sale should pay down debt, which we expect to occur later this year.", "I will now turn the call back to Dan for some additional comments.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Patty. Before we open the lines for questions this morning, I'd like to comment briefly on the conditions that Patty just described and what this means for Weyerhaeuser going forward.", "It will take unprecedented action on our part to deal with these economic conditions and the need to restructure our company in light of the portfolio changes that we've made. I think that it's important for everyone to understand just how seriously we're looking at the decisions that lie ahead.", "I believe in the future of this company and in our ability to meet this challenge. I also know however, that we can achieve the future success that I envision by taking incremental steps. Today's environment does not afford us that luxury. In the months ahead, you will see Weyerhaeuser take definitive steps to resize this company as a leader in the markets where we operate, positioning us to grow again when the time is right.", "Under Steve Rogel, we defined our strategy. We'll continue implementing that strategy with conviction and decisiveness. That's my focus and the focus of every leader at Weyerhaeuser.", "And now, I would like to open the call to your questions.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Eric, could you please open the lines.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from George Staphos with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks everyone, good morning. I guess, first off, congratulations to Steve, Dan and Larry and good luck in the upcoming months. First question I had, until the transaction in containerboard is finalized, Rich, what's the strategy going to be within containerboard? You actually performed I think comparatively better than we would have expected given the tractions and frankly even relative to a lot of the other players in the market? So, what's the strategy here going forward until the transaction?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, the strategy is the same George and that is to continue to improve the results in this business against the business model that I have described and that included rationalizing the low margin business and optimizing the system economics, looking at regional costs and paying attention to the supply side and sourcing the business we chose to keep at the least cost. And that team has done a tremendous job of executing that strategy as you can see, it's been very gratifying and I think the momentum is still there, it's remarkable.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "How do you fight against the natural tendency perhaps to try to drive now for more volume, maybe even at the expense of price, do you think or care about that much now given the next step in there?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "No, that's the one thing that we have really addressed well. The discipline around looking at margins and volume is not the game, margin is the game. In addition in the mills, we have gained great efficiencies and in the way we operate, but that is in strictly more volume than significant cost reduction and productivity improvements.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, that's helpful, thanks for it. I guess may be two questions to finish up. First off, maybe for Larry or Dan, what comments do you have on the proposal that have been offered in Washington about bringing more stability to the housing market and obviously to the related financing sectors, any thought on the Frank Dodd Bill or the other things that have been thought about?", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "We'll be interested to see what the folks in Washington do, but I thing any thing if they can do to kind of help stabilize the markets, particularly relative to foreclosure activity and what's happening I think would provide a very important stabilizing value to our markets.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Larry, do you have a preference at the juncture.", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "No, again but I think this is the function of been able to have actions that will really kind of bring back some confidence and help stabilize conditions in the market, give people confidence to come back into the market.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, I guess may be the last question, I will turn over. Obviously, with the IP transaction you're going to have an even stronger balance sheet. Obviously, with your comments and the directional guidance for the second quarter, your remaining sectors are struggling quite a bit because of the macro economic issues out there. They could be improved potentially with consolidation and you'll have the balance sheet which to do this, you're also potentially down the road move, potentially move towards the REIT structure and that would heighten perhaps the need to have a stronger balance sheet in the future. So, realizing that you can tell us point by point, detail by detail what you're thinking about and how it's going to proceed. How would you have us think about some of these issues ahead of the company over the next two, three quarters? Thanks very much.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll take that, George. As we've tried to articulate, over the last six to twelve months, our primary focus is on our strategy going forward, and then having structure, whatever that corporate structure might be, follow that strategy. Our strategy is to find with Timberlands at our core, and as we continue to review the portfolio, as you know, we've made the change in fine paper, emerged with Domtar, now we're selling Containerboard. We have sold and are in the process of selling some non-strategic assets, and then for the balance of the portfolio, getting to your question, we continue to examine our non-Timberlands assets and strategies for their long-term strategic fit and the long-term potential to enhance shareholder value.", "So beyond that, we're looking that process diligently, don't have specific comments related to the... our balance sheet, other than as Patty has shared, the intent is to use significant proceeds from that sale to pay down debt.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "All right thanks, I'll turn over.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Pease go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk in any more detail on Wood Products, that's encouraging to see that the loss has narrowed a bit despite what pricing and volumes did in the quarter. And I'm just wondering if there's any kind of, I guess, carry forward some actions and cost cutting that you did in the first quarter that we'll see kind of moving through the year or if that's just kind of an ongoing run rate?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll have Rich answer that one, Gail.", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Gail, I mentioned that one of the things we have done is trimmed down our distribution system to focus just on the distribution centers where we're serving the residential markets and taking overhead out and sales costs associated with non-strategic business and non-strategic locations.", "Obviously, as we've taken capacity out with permanent closures, you're correct in assuming that we've taken out the highest cost capacity. We've taken out a lot of Canadian capacity, for example. We're bringing on the lowest cost mills in the west. We're taking out high-cost capacity in our western lumber system. We've taken capacity out by the way ahead of our original schedule as we've addressed these weak markets. But we'll be coming back in with obviously no increased volume certainly in these markets, but at a much lower cost. So those are just some of the things off the top that I could give you as examples, but you're absolutely correct, our cost base going forward is lower and will be even lower.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. And did I notice in the footnotes correctly that you actually lost $1 million on land sales in WRECO in the quarter? Hello?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, we're here.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Gail, this is Dan. I'm used to answering the WRECO questions and I'm trying to getting used to passing it to Larry.", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Gail, I'll have to maybe take a mull again on that. I know we did have land sales in the home building business. I don't know whether we lost $1 million in the first quarter on them.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay.", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "I'll get back to you on that.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay, thank you. And just one last question, obviously less of a point going forward, but in containerboard in terms of box realizations, do you now feel that you've seen everything you're going to see from the kind of late 2007 price increase or as contracts roll off is there a little bit more to come?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, this is Rich. We are essentially complete, but you are also again correct in assuming there are a couple of more accounts that we still have to come open later on this year. But, we're essentially complete but there is still a little bit of carry over so there is some upside yes, in the price increase. And there is some more benefit ahead of us from the rationalization away from lower margin accounts that we haven't fully realized yet.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Thank you, Gail, this is Larry. Let me kind of see if I can jump back in there. We did lose $1 million in land sales and I think, that's been a consistent part of our business being able to sell land, and we've talked about it, it's about 10% of our volume and it's uneven when it occurs. The reason for the loss largely just go around because we were able to finally sell a golf course at Snoqualmie Ridge out here in the northwest.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Just one question. Dan, when we look across the Wood Products business across the industry, there is a long-term pattern of running below cash cost for a fairly substantial amount of time at a lot of different producers. I'm curious if you can help us understand the decision process and the criteria that Weyerhaeuser uses on when to idle a mill and when to make the more serious decision about closing it. Just help us understand how you guys think about it?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I am going to have Rich take the first half of that and then I'll conclude with some comments, because this is something that we study very diligently, because of the situation in the market today. Rich?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, as Dan said, we have a very disciplined and regular process of examining that. And we look at what is the demand telling us about the capacity response that we ought to have. And so that's where we start. And then we have our mills arrayed by their cash operating costs, and we look at the impact of a closure relative to continuing to run against our view of where this market may be headed. So, we've given you the example of why the industry has been slow to respond on the OSB side, and that is because these closure costs are extraordinarily high, and that is, by that I mean, you could be looking at an excess of a year of the cash losses at today's prices by closing with regard to severance and so on.", "In the lumber side, it is a little more flexible because you can manage shifts and be a little more nimble in that response to the demand that's out there. But, Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think the other thing that occurs Mark, is that, every manufacturer and supplier has their own perspective on future housing starts and what the cycle is going to look like, so you may have differing responses that occur simply be based upon a different view of when market will turn around, and when it does, whether it's going to be slow recovery or whether it will be more robust.", "So, as Rich says, we go through that process all the time. It is driven from a market back what the demand is, but then depending upon competitor actions and we respond.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Okay. That's helpful, thanks.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's a tough one as we go through this kind of a cycle.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, I can imagine. I can imagine, my congratulations to you.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Ruschmeier with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks, good morning, and congratulations to Dan and Larry. I wanted to ask a question if I could to Patty if you could help us to understand how the passage of the Tree Act has currently written, would have impacted your cash taxes in recent years?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, Pete in terms of the way that the Tree Act is currently included in Senate Bill, as we have said in the past, going back couple of years its somewhere around $150 million. That is the way that it's currently written we'll have to see what eventually does come out of the Congress in terms of particular specifics of whatever does get passed but right now, the guidance that we've given in the past is still the same.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, that's helpful. Question for Dan, if I could, maybe an observation and followed by question. As we take a big step back and look at Weyerhaeuser, share prices flat in recent years, even though you've got some of the best Timberlands with the market, where values have risen very sharply in recent years in a private market, your debt is down more than $6 billion since the time Willamette was acquired and I guess against that back drop, Dan, I was curious if you could comment on the types of strategic actions you might consider and frankly, importantly the types of actions in your opinion you might rule out and if you can wrap all this up in one question, how you juxtapose your view of the world against your predecessor or the previous Weyerhaeuser management team.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say that the view... my view of world is not different than Steve Rogel's, we've been on a path recent years of refocusing our efforts on our Timberlands, as you commented, we made acquisitions, significant acquisitions like MacMillan Bloedel, Willamette industries. With those acquisitions came not only fiber business, but also significant timberlands.", "So those timberlands, for the most part or still part of our portfolio, we were building our strategy around those timberlands. We're focusing on businesses that we believe enhance the value of those timberlands either for instance through our lumber business where we might drive more value back to the timberlands and we're also focused on improving the returns from timberlands coming from our minerals activity higher and better use activity and most recently, our initiative with Chevron, which has the potential to create value through biomass, biofuel.", "The other businesses are going to have to earn competitive returns of recycle. They're going to have to have our positions that are defensible and allow them to operate top quartile in their industries and they are going to have to be able to support themselves in a capital structure, so that as we go forward we continue to improve value for our shareholders.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. That's very helpful. If I could just lastly follow-up with perhaps a question for Rich, Rich, can you comment on the budget at a high level that you're thinking about for the harvest volumes for 2008, especially relative to their long-term potential? I would think they might be down a bit and then relatively, can you comment on how the Tree Act or possibly other tax advantaged structure possibilities might allow you to bring some harvest forward relative to your future timber harvest plans?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, Peter, I guess I won't speculate on how we might harvest with regard to tax consequences, but I would say from a strategic and operating standpoint, you're correct. Our harvests are at a lower level than they've been. I think we've discussed that in the past why that is. And going out into the future, there is upside potential in the south.", "I've commented earlier too that some of that upside was delayed a little bit by some of the storm damages that we experienced in our southern operations, Katrina being the most recent, but the ice storms before that. But still, significant upside. So we're at a low point, both because of the markets and our view of what makes sense for the maximization of present value, considering growth and value on those lands.", "In the west, right now, we're at a little bit lower level, but also, if there's some noise in there as we pick up the salvage that was damaged in the December wind storms. Does that help, Peter?", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "That's helpful. Thanks very much, guys.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question", "Operator", "Well, next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed go ahead.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Good morning. Dan, a couple of longer term questions. One, not long after Steve took over back in 1998 he came to New York and he kind of walked us through Weyerhaeuser in each of the businesses and he categorized each of them in kind of a serious of categories whether they were businesses you wanted to monetize, businesses you want to optimize or businesses you wanted to expand. Knowing that you are going through review work right now, when do you think you will be ready to do that sort of thing for us?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Mark, it's an ongoing process. We're going to spend sometime in May in our analysts meeting talking about our Timberland strategy, one of the things that we haven't spend a lot of time on with you is the degree that, we use our R&D capabilities to innovate not just in our Timberlands business but, also our Wood Products business and Cellulose Fibers business.", "So, we are going to talk a bit about that. That's part of our strategy in trying to drive greater value for the products that we do manufacture, which also enable us to keep a competitive edge in our industries. So, I would say we're going to have some of that discussion in May, but, it will be an ongoing dialogue.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, and I'd like to just get your reaction to an observation of mine which is, if you look at the company over a long period of time, it really it's generated very good cash flow from the Timberland and the land holdings and it just seems like over the decades one of the biggest issues is that when it tries to use that cash to diversify whether it's got into financial services or more recently just trying to make consolidation moves in the industry, it's often struggled?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's a fair comment and when we talk about Timberland as our focus, some of it is an acknowledgment of that and we're committed to growing our Timberland's income and we are committed in the other businesses in which we are engaged that they support themselves and that they do not detract from our core business, which we continue to see as Timberlands.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And to the extent that you want to focus on Timberland and you may be want to do things outside of North America, where you either have to invest capital upfront to develop plantations or whether where tax considerations may not fit as well within a REIT, can you just... can you talk about that issue?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as you know, we're active in South America.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Right.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And we have been pleased with our progress there. We got into Uruguay relatively early compared to some other investors as you know we're creating plantations there rather than buying existing Timberlands. We've also built a plywood facility there to help monetize that resource.", "We continue to look for expansion opportunities in that market. We've got... we've had good success so far in our South American strategy and we believe that we've got an opportunity there to leverage our Timberland's capabilities and we've created an excellent relationship with local government, based upon the way we approach our Timberlands and the stewardship that we apply to our assets. And so, we're optimistic about opportunities to continue to grow South America, but when the timing is right, we'll continue to invest in North America.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Last question I had, I have heard that there are some producers out west who are integrated, who are literally just shutting down sawmills and wood products plants and choosing to sell that fiber into the open market because the log prices are actually higher than the losses they would be generating if they just ran the stuff through the sawmill. Are you doing any of that right now, or how do you think about that?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Rich, can you address that?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, we have a lot of capacity curtailed back in terms of manufacturing. We're somewhat unique in that the large part of our harvest that's dedicated toward the Japan log export market. And so in our case, we're serving a firm market that looks firm going ahead, and we have cut back in the outside wood that we buy as we've downsized our systems. So I can't really comment about individual competitors, but that's really the changes that we've experienced.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Thanks, Rich.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from. Chip Dillon with Citi. Please go head.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Yes, Good morning, and congratulations, Dan, on your new position.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Chip.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "First question is on the Containerboard sale. Is there... how much of the wood was your system getting from your own either forests or as residuals from your own wood plants? And is there any kind of an agreement? And what are the terms, roughly, of that agreement with IP?", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Can somebody help me in terms of the ...our ability to comment on specific terms?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think we can comment.", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. We really can't comment on the terms...", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "We do have supply agreements.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The terms that that we have with IP. There is a supply agreement, as you might imagine, in this kind of a transaction, but those specifics are confidential.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Okay. And then just quickly, on the succession timing, I remember when I guess Steve and the Board talked about him remaining through into the middle of '09, and I think we were... at least I was under the impression as CEO and I just didn't know if something had changed in the business or maybe it was just more of a personal decision to make the transition sooner, or am I just mistaken?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Steve shared with the financial community that he had committed to stay through as late as the end of '09, based on what the Board wanted to do, and so we made a change in December when I took over as President, and it was really a joint decision between the Board and Steve that I would move up to CEO at this time, he continues as the Chair very much involved, so that there should be no negative connotation whatsoever in the timing of that change nor was there any real change in direction. I think the Board made a determination that they were ready to continue to move forward, shift Steve into a Chairman role. He's still actively engaged with me, and I hope that he'll be able to stay through the end of '09.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "With an office actually there at the complex?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "He's got an office here. I think he's getting a little more time with his spouse, who is happy to see him a little bit more. He is not in the office today and, as I said, not on this call today, but I see him in the queue. I'm waiting for a question to come in from him. He's engaged, but he's not in the office today.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Then the last question, as you look at the structure of the company, it seems to me that looking at one of the options for tax efficiency, obviously the Tree Act is a big one. It certainly would not go as far in terms of especially when the, if and when the 2003 tax changes expired in 2010. May not go as far as what you would see if your restructures REIT and it looks like that you all are making the decision just externally that is a path that either is just as to own risk or one that just doesn't seem to be one that's easy for you to do since it would seem to be very difficult to see you comport to that structure anytime soon?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have not ruled out that structure. As I continue to say, we are focused on what our ongoing strategy is going to be. We've certainly been heavily engaged in attempting to gain passage of Tree Act which we believe is beneficial for the entire industry and will provide us with significant tax benefit and some greater flexibility as it relates to managing our portfolio but we continue to evaluate all alternatives with a back drop being that we will settle on a strategy and they will continue to monitor not only changes in tax law related to Tree Act but there could be potential changes that ultimately affect a reach structure.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Got you. Thank you very much.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, thank you. Just a couple of questions. First, I just wondered do you think we will see a lot more bulk Timberland coming to the market due to the decline in saw log prices and the record valuations that we're still seeing here and with that do you see potential for correction in private timberland valuations over the next 1 to 2 years?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think we are prepared to speculate on Timberland values. There has been a lot of comment and analysis of recent trades. I do believe that Timberlands are likely trading at some value attribution to the timber itself, but also certainly the land and every piece is unique with respect to HPU potential, minerals potential and then I think also today we are seeing some value attribution that is very difficult to define related to biomass and the potential that exist and some of which we hope to demonstrate on our own property.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "But just generally speaking, in the industry, do you see potential for... or are you seeing it now more supply coming on to market?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It has not been evident to us that there is significant more supply coming.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just on the Tree Act I mean, it certainly seems that we are pretty close in the Farm Bill you had to fight very aggressively to push the Tree Act this far. If the Farm Bill does get signed by the President, what's your level of confidence that you can get the Tree Act extended for a longer period of times given that we are headed into the heart of the presidential election and certainly seems the funding issues for tax reductions or getting harder to justify in Congress?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as you know if the Tree Act is passed along with the Farm Bill at least it has been discussed today it would be passed and effective for a one year period and then following that it would go into an annual extender package. Experience shows that in that extender package predictability is relatively high. But I think the market will have to observe that for a bit. There are also issues that will come in... in terms of those extender packagers there is a number of tax initiatives that routinely rollover. R&D exemptions, sales tax deductibility and I can't comment in handicapped, but experience shows that high degree of likelihood that it would be extended if it falls into that annual extender program.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "But do you generally proceed that being the process as opposed to being... as opposed to having an avenue or you can get the Tree Act potentially extended for three or five year period all at once or do you just sort of have to just take it year-by-year and hope that it gets renewed?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Seems that you have to take it year-by-year.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Thank you. First, you said in your prepared remarks, in the months ahead you'll see definitive steps to resize the company. Am I right in interpreting from that that you have actually pretty much determined, figuring from a portfolio management perspective, what's your strategy is going to... what it is, and in the months ahead we are going to see that being executed or implemented?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The resizing comment is more reflective ongoing G&A and operating cost related to the support of our businesses. So, we have been through a process where we spun off our fine paper business. Now, we are going to process of selling the containerboard packaging business. If you look at the overall size of the company, containerboard packaging has over 14,000 employees. It's a significant part of our asset base, it's a significant part of our employee base and so the resizing that I am talking about is resizing support cost G&A. So, that is those businesses leave the portfolio the right size in our line in our operating cost in orders to support the businesses that remain in the portfolio.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "you give us a sense of to that the type of our reduction in corporate expense that's feasible to this right sizing?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't want to comment on that right now because we were going through that process. Obviously, we were still supporting this business, but we are making plans today for what happens after that sale is concluded.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "In terms of the net proceeds on that containerboard sale, can you update us of that $6 billion sale how much you expect to end up in net proceeds and help us understand that number please?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Mark, this is Patty and what we have said I think as you are aware that it is not of $4 billion and that will fluctuate depending upon one, eventual timing of the closing is of the sale and we were working through that, but at this point I wouldn't want to give you on more exact number.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. I mean could it be... I guess as I look at $6 billion number and I realize it had a low tax base, but I assume there is also working capital that goes into the transaction and just seems like a very significant amount of tax leakage or is there something not obvious or is it possible that it could be as much as $500 million higher than $4 billion number?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It will be higher than the 4 billion and you are correct and that it does have a very low tax base as we have talked about in the past. So, the working capital number will be included in the $6 billion. So, it is not additive to the $6 billion.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And then lastly, in the past, we talked a little bit about you going out and doing all the paper work to get all the deed information on the Timberlands that you own et cetera. Can you tell us where do you stand in that process, have you gotten all the paper work on the Timberland deed or is that still not completed?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We... I'm not sure what comment you are talking about in the past. I mean we have all the information that we need on our Timberlands. We run our own title shop and so there is.", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "That's a good one.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "There is really no uncertainty or ambiguity about any kind of documentation or records related to our Timberlands.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "So, you have all the paper work on your Timberland ownership at this point on the deeds. Thanks.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely. We are in good shape. Yeah.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning and thank you. I wanted to focus on building products for a minute. If I heard Rich correctly, you are running 50% of the capacity in OSB and 70% lumber?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "That's correct.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Is that correct?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Correct.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "And then can you just quantify how much of that is permanent indefinite or temporarily idle out of those two businesses?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "It's next year, I mean that would take some more work maybe with Kathy to sort it for you, but I mean it's... no I can't comment right up.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "I'll get back to you Rich and we will go through some of those facilities and which one we have announced for permanent closure.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Sure, and as you think about maybe when the market does comeback how easy do you think it would be and your thought process to when those mills, due come back it could restarted?", "Richard E. Hanson - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, it's more difficult with the oriented strand board piece and relatively easy with lumber, but in many of those cases in lumber we have, those are permanent closures and they are again I think in our financial information and working with Kathy we can tell you about the permanent closers component.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Great. I'll follow-up with Kathy. Thank you.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Talk to you later Rick.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. I just you like to make couple of closing comments. Based upon our remarks and then listening to the questions, obviously there continue to be a number of questions related to our ongoing strategy and our focus for the future and so we look forward to continuing dialogue. I want to continue to make the point that positioning the company for future growth in areas that will enhance shareholder value, the questions around structure. We will be determined ultimately by our business strategy which has Timberlands at our core.", "We talked this morning about the challenging times that were in with respect to the housing market and how that's affecting both our wood products business and our WRECO operation. And so we're dealing with that as Rich mentioned. We have curtailed, we have downsized wood products in order to respond to decreases in demand. As we come out of the cycle, it will be our expectation that we would see recovery in a really reversal order as the way we went into this. So, when things started to slowdown in housing, we saw the result of that first in our wood products business in 2006 and then following that we see a chill up in WRECO part of that because wood products has a national footprint whereas WRECO has a original foot print and then as we come out of the cycle you know I think we'll start to see recovery sooner in WRECO followed by wood products based upon the competitive environment. So we're focused on that.", "We are focused as I said on rightsizing our support cost based upon the portfolio that we will become following the disposition of our containerboard packaging business and as we continue to evaluate our business portfolio, we'll continue to have dispositions of what we consider to be non-core strategic assets and we'll be defining our future around our portfolio that will support our Timberlands and will be supported by businesses that add value to the Timberlands and businesses that have the ability to meet their cost of capital and the competitors in their business that will position us over the cycle to create maximum value.", "So, I appreciate everybody's attention this morning. We welcome the opportunity to answer your questions and we look forward to seeing you in New York on the 30th of May and to the extent you've further questions today you can follow up with Kathy. Thanks very much.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you for joining us today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Weyerhaeuser 2008 first quarter earnings conference call.

In today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode.", "Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded, Tuesday, August 5th, 2008.", "I would now like to turn the conference to Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma'am.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you, Eric. Good morning. Welcome to Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. I'm Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Dan Fulton, President and CEO; Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tom Gideon, Executive Vice President - Forest Products and Larry Burrows, President, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.", "This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release and material for this call can be found at the website or by contacting April Myer at 253-924-2937. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements.", "Forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported a second quarter 2008 net loss of $96 million or $0.45 per diluted share on net sales of $3.6 billion.", "The second quarter included the following after tax items:", "A charge for impairments and reserves related to real-estate assets of $206 million or $0.98 per diluted share;", "A gain for book purposes on the ownership restructuring of Uruguay assets of an estimated $101 million or $0.48 per diluted share;", "A gain related to charges imposed to changes, excuse me, imposed retirement benefit of $32 million or $0.15 per diluted share;", "A charge for restructuring primary corporate staff of $24 million or $0.11 per diluted share;", "A charge for closures and asset impairments, primarily in wood products of $20 million or $0.9 per diluted share;", "A gain of $14 million or $0.7 per diluted share, for the reversal of tax accruals due to the lapse of statues of limitation.", "Excluding these items, the company had a net income of $7 million or $0.03 per diluted share. A GAAP reconciliation of special items is available on our website in the earnings information package.", "Please turn to chart 4 in the earnings information package as we will next discuss the waterfall [ph] chart.", "Chart four is a bar chart detailing the changes in earnings per share on a segment basis from first quarter 2008 to second quarter 2008. As noted in the first bar, on chart 4, Q1 `08 the company lost $0.24 per share. Quarters-to-quarter changes in corporate earnings were as follows and we're going to proceed from left to right across the waterfall [ph] chart. So we begin with the Timberland segment.", "Higher costs, slightly lowered prices and fewer non strategic land sales more than offset higher volumes, lowering Timberland's earnings by $0.02 per share. Higher wood products prices, lower costs and volume improvements resulted in a $0.21 per share contribution to earnings from wood products.", "Cellulose fibers earnings were lower by $0.04 per share. Price increases were more than offset by higher manufacturing cost, due to scheduled maintenance at three mills and higher raw material cost.", "Containerboard Packaging and Recycling earnings was $0.03 per share higher. Not expensing depreciation contributed $0.18 per share. Higher prices contributed $0.13 per share and volumes were favorable, partially offsetting these positives with the impact of the Iowa flood and higher manufacturing cost.", "Price declines resulted in real-estate earnings $0.01 per share lower then in Q1. Last, corporate and other were $0.10 per share higher due to foreign exchange gains and lower variable comp. The final bar to the right of the page is the second quarter 2008 gain before special items of $0.03 per share.", "I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton, Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Kathy. Today's results clearly demonstrate the challenges presented by the current conditions in the housing market. The effect of this slowdown is deep and touches virtually every business in our portfolio. In response, we're addressing our near term challenges. We've taken aggressive steps that today's market conditions demand and if necessary we are prepared to take additional actions.", "But we are also looking to the future and the opportunities ahead. Our future is built on world class timberlands and valuable land holdings. We are committed to maximizing the value of these assets by applying industry leading silver culture [ph] practices, investing in the potential of biofuel through our joint venture with Chevron and extracting values from the extensive of mineral rights, that we hold.", "To this, we add supporting businesses, unique research capabilities and a real estate business focused on serving housing markets with some of the highest potential in the country. Over the past several years we've adjusted our business to enhance our focus on our Timberland land holdings. In the process, we simplified the portfolio and cut costs. These are actions that have strengthened our balance sheet and positioned us to choose the most efficient corporate structure in business portfolio to maximize shareholder return.", "Just yesterday, we finished a significant step in that process by completing the sale of our Containerboard Packaging and Recycling business, International Paper. In the process International Paper has outstanding assets and approximately 14,000 dedicated employees to its Containerboard Packing business. We thank these employees for their contributions to Weyerhaeuser and we know that they can contribute to the success of International Paper.", "Today our businesses are leaner and we continue to trim overhead costs. In addition we started restructuring our corporate support staff to meet the needs of our more tightly focused company. Over the next 18 months, we will complete the elimination of approximately 1500 corporate level positions and achieve ongoing savings of $375 million per year.", "As we move forward, we will continue to pursue other opportunities to streamline the organization. This is an aggressive program that we will achieve approximately 50% of the ultimate savings by year end and the full amount when we phase out support agreements associated with the Domtar and the International Paper transactions.", "Additionally, we have revised some of our benefits to improve the competitiveness of our businesses while maintaining our attractiveness as an employer. We emerged from this process a leaner and more focused company. We however will not lose sight of what has made this company great. We remain dedicated to creating a safe work environment and to growing and harvesting trees in a sustainable manner. We'll be good stewards of the environment and play an integral role in the communities in which we operate.", "We will maintain a diverse work force and empower our employees to help us serve our markets, our customers and our communities. In addition, we will have operational excellence in our businesses. This is where I have to point to Tom Gideon as Executive Vice President, Forest Products.", "Many of you have met Tom, in his previous roles as our Senior Vice President of either Timberlands or Containerboard Packaging and Recycling. What you may not know is that he's also spent extensive time in the Wood Products business, in addition to holding positions in human resources and sales. As he just demonstrated with the steady improvement that our Containerboard Packaging and Recycling business achieved under his leadership, Tom gets results.", "In his new role, Tom will work closely with the talented leaders in our Timberlands, Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers businesses to further enhance our operational excellence. To describe the second quarter performance of these businesses, and the steps that we're taking to meet market conditions, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas F. Gideon - Executive Vice President Forest Products", "Thank you, Dan. As you mentioned, we continue to face challenging market conditions. But before I get to our operational results, I'd like to start on a positive note by recognizing our excellent safety performance. We've continued to maintain [ph] a recordable incident rate of less than one. As we mentioned in the past, there is a strong correlation between improved safety performance and operational excellence.", "Safer operations reduce cost, enhance productivity and improve quality. Over the past quarter, our employees have faced enormous challenges ranging from the divestiture of a major business to extremely trying markets. It is a credit to our employees and their continued focused on safety, that we were able to maintain an excellent safety performance and achieve production records despite these distractions.", "I know there are people who remain vigilant in the quarter ahead and have their concerted focus will help us operate safely and at our best during this tough markets.", "The plan [ph] in timber are our foundations, I will start by reviewing our performance in Timberland, a business that continues to perform relatively well, given the market conditions. For those following the slides in the investor section of our website, this is chart five.", "As expected, we are feeling the affects of the continued softness of the California housing market which resulted in slightly lower prices in the west. In addition, we are closely monitoring our harvest levels to keep them in line with demand, I should point out however that our tree [ph] harvest levels in the west, actually increased during the quarter as we continue to salvage trees, damaged by the December storms in Washington and Oregon. Due to concerns about the degradation of the wood underground, we are quickly salvaging as much of the slow down as possible.", "Most of the salvage timber is white wood, such as Hemrun [ph] and we have been able to ship increased volumes into our Korean markets. We are still maintaining our historic export premium and the outlook for our export market remains strong. Especially since the Russians, raised their log export tax 25% in April, which will make our logs more competitive in Korea and China.", "In the south, the story mainly involves fuel, where higher prices have increased our transportation and harvesting cost. Higher fuel costs have also increased interest in domestic drilling. As a result, we continue to see a strong contribution from our minerals group.", "Moving to wood products, I will direct your attention to chart 6 and 7. The positive news is that we have experienced modest price improvements in lumber and OSP. Demand however continues to be a concern. The single family housing start rate is now at 670,000 or nearly 56% below 2006 levels.", "As Dan noted in his comments, Weyerhaeuser is taking aggressive steps to adjust our production to match the reduced demand. Compared with 2006 capacity levels, we have reduced oriented strand board productions by 48% and lumber by 30%.", "Our engineered product lines are operating at less than 50% of their 2006 capacity, even though, we saw a slight improvement in demand during the second quarter. We believe these steps have been an appropriate response to the weak market conditions. While we can't control market forces, we will continue to focus on the things we can control. Improving our sales penetration and operating efficiencies.", "Meanwhile turning to chart 8, our cellulose fibers business continues to perform well and benefits from the weak U.S. dollar. While we benefited from improved realizations, we also experienced higher transportation, fuel, fiber and energy costs during the quarter. In addition, with more goods being shipped from the U.S. than in the past, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure shipping containers.", "During the quarter, this month we experienced delay in shipping This month we experienced delay in shipping of approximately 15,000 ton of pulp in June which negatively affected the earnings from this business. In addition, scheduled mill outages reduced our production by 37,000 tons.", "The long term outlook for cellulose fibers remains extremely strong. And in addition to having some of the industry's most efficient mills, we continue to look for ways to leverage our focus on absorbent pulps. Earlier this month, we took a significant step in that direction by agreeing to collaborate with Lenzing, the world market leader in cellulose staple fibers, to explore development of novel lyocell-based nonwoven fabrics.", "The objective of the collaboration is to develop a technology for the large scale industrial production of an innovative and sustainable cellulose based material for industrial and personal care applications. The technology will provide an alternative to more expensive petroleum based materials and non woven products with raw materials based on renewal with fiber.", "Turning to chart 9 and 10, I will conclude my remarks today with a discussion of our Containerboard Packing and Recycling business. It's been my privilege to work with this team through our strategic review and ultimately the sale and transition of the business to International Paper.", "Throughout this process, the team has worked together to represent the best of Weyerhaeuser and to demonstrate the potential of this business. Over the past 15 months, this business has worked safely, improved our operating margins, implemented price increases, brought in new business and achieved all of our cost reduction targets, I couldn't be proud of this team and I know it will be a great addition to International Paper.", "Although results of this businesses final quarter with Weyerhaeuser were hurt by the flood in Iowa that affected our Cedar River Container Board mill and our Cedar Rapids box plants, we improved packaging realizations by 4.1% compared with first quarter and we managed our accounts to be in line with planned volume expectations.", "In closing, while I need to acknowledge the challenges we are facing, I am also very optimistic about the future of our forest products businesses. Through our recent divestitures, we have created a more focused and closely-aligned set of assets.", "Our mission is to present options to Weyerhaeuser, its shareholders and employees by improving the overall value of our portfolio, by operating safely and improving operating performance to justify continued investment. Short term, this will require us to manage effectively through the down cycle and position our businesses to succeed in the up cycle.", "Longer term we are focused on insuring, we are leaders in each respective business segment and there we've established viable platforms for future growth, we have the assets and the people to achieve both our short term", "We have the assets and the people to achieve, both our short term and long term objectives. As I commented to you to use that we will operate these businesses to achieve maximum shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Larry Burrows, who will discuss our Real Estate business.", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Thank you, Tom and good morning. For your reference, recourse to statistical highlights are included in the Investor section of our website on chart 11.", "The housing market remains exceptionally difficult. The traditionally strong second quarter spring selling season never materialized. Reduced demand and lower consumer confidence has led to increasing excess inventory of new and existing homes, which now approaches 11 months.", "New home prices remain under pressure as builders compete for more limited supply of customers. Existing homes have also experienced significant decline with the Case-Shiller 20 city composite index declining 16% year-over-year. More stringent mortgage underwriting has similarly constrained demand, particularly at the lower price points. Throughout this challenging environment, our operating response remained the same. Specifically, we continue to decrease unsold inventory, reduce land acquisition and land development spending, adjust staffing and substitute smaller less expensive products.", "Examining conditions across our markets, there are few bright spots. San Diego and Houston have held up better, although at reduced sales paces. Puget Sound has significantly slowed. The Washington DC area is approaching the third anniversary of the housing downturn, with little evidence of improvement.", "Las Vegas, Phoenix and the Inland Empire region of California remain our most challenged markets and are hampered by accelerating foreclosure activity. Reduced sales have decreased our single family home soul; but not closed what we call our backlog to just under four months sales.", "Last month, we warned about significant impairments; as an operating discipline we routinely re-evaluate our land pipeline to gauge project profitability. In the past, our higher margins have helped cushion the valuation impact of slower sales and reduced pricing.", "As sales pace and price continue to deteriorate, in many of our communities that cushion is gone. This is the basis for the impairment charges recognized in the quarter which were 311 million for home building assets and real estate investments.", "In addition, 23 million of capitalized interest was impaired in the corporate segment. The majority of our impairments were taken in our home building operations covering California, Nevada and Maryland and at WRI, our real estate investment company.", "Excess supply, wary buyers and continued credit market tightness make the outlook for housing for the balance of the year, exceptionally difficult. Our local managers are experienced and have operated in such a challenged environment, before. We are well equipped to successfully manage through the near term and benefit at the market stabilized and transition to recovery.", "I will now turn the call over to Patty, to discuss the outlook for third quarter?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Larry, and good morning everybody. I'll start my comments about the third quarter outlook with the discussion of Timberland. We expect sea log [ph] volumes to decrease seasonally, in both the West and the South. Domestic pricing is also likely to decrease some what, while the export market in the West is holding up well.", "We expect costs to increase due to seasonally higher silver cultural spending and higher logging costs primarily as a result of higher fuel expense. Increased earrings from oil and gas revenue and a higher level of income from non strategic timberland sales are expected to offset these negative factors and result in overall segment income, slightly higher in the third quarter compared to the second.", "Challenging market conditions for wood products will persist through the quarter. Average sales realizations will be mixed but overall should have a small positive impact compared to the second quarter, primarily in engineered wood products and OSB.", "Shipment volumes across product lines will likely decrease, however we don't see a significant earnings impact from the reduced volume. Manufacturing costs including raw material costs are expected to be favorable compared to the second quarter. For this segment, we expect operating losses for the third quarter to be just slightly less compared to the second quarter.", "Larry has already described the market conditions, we faced in our Real Estate segment. Congress has taken some action with the passage of the Housing Bill, at the end of last month; however it's unlikely to result in any meaningful improvement for this quarter. We expect single family margins will continue to be under pressure from the overhang of inventory and ongoing discounting which continues to characterize the competitive response to these difficult conditions.", "However, we do expect some modest improvement in margins resulting from more favorable mixed in the third quarter. Closing volumes will likely decrease in the third quarter. Excluding the effect of impairments, we expect the third quarter loss in our single family real estate operations to be comparable to that of the second quarter.", "In cellulose fibers, we expect that market conditions will continue to be favorable. Average sales realizations are anticipated to increase in the third quarter, over the second. In addition, we have fewer scheduled annual maintenance adages, as we have completed four of six mills as of the end of the second quarter. This should dramatically improve our operating results through lower manufacturing cost, as a result of higher productivity and reduced maintenance cost.", "These positive results will be partially offset by increased chemical cost. We expect significantly higher earnings in the sale of fiber segment in the third quarter, compared to the second. As is already been discussed, we closed on the sale of our Containerboard Packaging and Recycling assets, yesterday. As a result the earnings in this segment in the third quarter will only include one month of operation.", "The sales price was $6 billion to be adjusted proposed closing adjustments including final working capital in closing comps. We expect to record an after tax gain of over $200 million. The after tax proceeds are anticipated to be between $4 billion to $4.5 billion.", "As we have previously stated, we will use a substantial portion of the proceeds to reduce debt with the remainder to support further restructuring as well as growth opportunities. While we will have a significant tax bill to pay in December, we will be investing the proceeds in the mean time which will result in additional interest income.", "As Dan mentioned earlier, we continue to execute our program to sell other non strategic assets. In July for example we closed, on the sale of our Australian asset which resulted in cash proceeds of over 300 million. In the first six months of the year, Weyerhaeuser Company has spent 234 million for capital expenditures. Spending for the full year is anticipated to be between $400 million and $450 million.", "Finally, let me comment on one of the special items discussed in earnings release. During the second quarter, we made some changes in our benefit plans primarily retiring medical benefits. These changes resulted in a re-measurement of the unfunded liability as of the end of the quarter. We've included a more extensive explanation in our 10Q, which we'll be filing, later this week.", "But essentially these changes resulted in the reduction of our liability by approximately $365 million, which on an after tax basis increased our shareholders equity by approximately $200 million. Most of which will be reflected as an increase to other comprehensive income, on our quarter end balance sheet. Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, for some final comments before we begin our Q&A. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Patty. There's no doubt that we are operating in tough economic environment. As we manage through these conditions, we are also taking actions to achieve our goal of deliver maximum shareholder returns and every step we've taken over the past two years has been consistent with that objective.", "Last year, this involved our transaction with Domtar. We followed that earlier this year with the passage of the Tree Act, which will reduce our tax burden. And then just yesterday as we reported, we completed the Containerboard transaction, which allows us to pay down debt and provides us with improved financial flexibility.", "We continue to divest non strategic assets, allowing us to generate cash and tighten our focus. We've already begun the process to right size our support functions to make our businesses more competitive and finally we will continue to drive improvements into our businesses under the operational leadership of Tom Gideon and Larry Burrows. All of this puts us in the best possible position to choose the right structure for the right reasons at the right time. And now I would like to open the lines to your questions.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Eric, would you please open the line to questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Absolutely. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from George Staphos with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks. Everyone, good morning. If we look at cellulose fibers for a minute, given your outlook and given the favorable trends you have seen in that business, what offsetting or compensating changes might you be seeing as well from the competitive landscape or perhaps not, do you expect competition to increase in that business over time, why or why not? And then I have a follow-on thanks guys.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, George.", "Thomas F. Gideon - Executive Vice President Forest Products", "Hello, George, this is Tom, that's a business that we continue to perform very well and we do excellent in terms of our fundamental manufacturing and we participated extremely well in the markets Fluff Pulp arena, which we think is a added advantage for us. In addition, as we talked about with our announcement about Lenzing, we continue to look into new innovative ways, where we can get into specialty fiber markets that have higher margins. So I can't comment on exactly everything that may be done in a competitive environment, but our focus is to continue to manufacture wealth, to move into the areas that we have good market presence and to expand our specialty fiber opportunities.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "So, Tom if you think about it as a gap related to time or duration. what kind of gap, do you think you have relative to your peers, relative to the technology and science you have in fibers, which give an advantage in the market, is it now six months is it five years, could give us a flavor obviously, if not an audited figure", "Thomas F. Gideon - Executive Vice President Forest Products", "It's really hard to determine that. But we have a long history of excellence in our research and development components of our business. We have been innovative in our businesses and again going back to the Lenzing example, which is a joint development agreement, we are looking to move quickly, we think, we are certainly in the forefront of innovation in our industry. And I can't give you an exact number, but we think we are doing extremely well in this arena.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "All right, last question; I will turn over, Dan or Larry. What factors or timing, could we expect to see for WRECO to get back to breakeven levels, any short thoughts on that? Thanks. Good luck on the quarter.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, George. I will let Larry address that", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Okay,this is a Larry, George, I think what we would be like to able to see is some firming in the market place where customers have confidence that the home they buy today, the value will be there, that they will also be in a position to be able to either sell existing home, if they have one or they are able to go out in the market place and get attractive financing.", "Also I think we would be looking for some of the higher levels of inventory both in the existing home market and new home market to clear a little bit. So I think those are some of the kind of the fundamentals, that we would like to see improve, that would allow us to... on an operational basis get back to generating some earnings.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "All right I will turn it over thanks.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman, UBS. Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Hi, maybe following up on that last question. Can you share any of your views on when you might see that firming in the housing market? Kind of what your forecasts are for housing starts '09 and 2010?", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Gail,this is Larry. I'm not sure our crystal ball is better than anybody else's. I think what we've said is, we expect the market for the... certainly the balance of this year to be challenging. I think that what we'll be looking for is to settle this inventory which is running out to 11 months and needs to clear the market place and our customers need to begin to have some confidence to be able to weigh [ph] back into the market.", "They are being rewarded for not being urgent right now and the longer they wait, it's for their benefit and I think those are the kind of conditions that need to change which probably will take us well into next year before we see any improvement.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay and changing gears. There's been a couple of comments about mineral rights, mineral income I mean and can you just give a little color on what you are seeing and what opportunities you have, may be kind of upon your six million acres of land and how many mineral rights, just over seeing and what type of changes there have been this year?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Gail. Just a little bit of color, historically we've had a practice of retaining mineral rights even when we sell land and so we have currently mineral rights covering about 6.4 million acres across the country. This has been an active business for us for some time period of time. So we have an active minerals group that operates within out Timberland's organization. Their typical practice has been to generally lease those mineral rights, in return for your fee income from the leases plus in some cases royalties and in some cases, we actually participate with the party that may be leasing the property.", "There's been a lot of activity recently publicized in Louisiana in particular, where we have some holdings and on the Louisiana question let me just turn that over to Tom to give a little bit of local flavor for what's happening down there.", "Thomas F. Gideon - Executive Vice President Forest Products", "Well, thanks Dan, you know Gail, just to give you a little bit of background. In the greater of what we call the Haynesville shale play there, we have approximately 115,000 acres in which we have mineral rights and we acquired these rights as a result of the Morana [ph] transaction in 2002.", "Our mineral rights are positioned throughout the greater play and we have a relatively small, but I would say attractive footprint in the Souther Terris [ph] which is really the very core of that play, at this point of time.", "As Dan mentioned for a portion of those acres, we have entered into a short term leases with very significant upfront bonus rates and excellent royalty participation that will allows us to share significantly in any ongoing revenue streams that come from that. And we're actively looking and considering all the options in that area that will allow us to best monetize the value we have in our mineral holdings.", "In the outstanding partners, the location of our properties, the mineral rights traditionally might have represented gravel, but in some cases it would include possible oil and gas activity, coal and in some cases hard rock minerals and then in certain locations where we operate, our operators in the past we've got geothermal resources that may provide some potential. We view the mineral rights as a significant long term asset in the company and we actively manage it.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay, that's very helpful, thank you.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Ruschmeier with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks, good morning. Curious, following up on the mineral rights question, if you could help us to understand maybe on a trailing 12 months basis, what kind of income we've seen there and what kind of trajectory you've seen and I guess related to that, would you consider Dan, perhaps breaking out that segment, as a separate line item?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's a good question Pete. We manage this process and we reported on the mineral income and I think, it would be helpful for us to provide some greater visibility to that, and so we can do so. In terms of the past six to twelve months, Patty could you address that question.", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "Well don't I go ahead and take that on. Particularly over the course of the year, we have generated approximately 22 million in earnings from our Mineral Segment with cash flow of about 48 million and a significant portion of that is due to the activity we're seeing in our Louisiana properties. And I would just like to say at this point of time, we are very comfortable with the evaluations we have received so far and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to actively look and explore and consider all the options we can to maximize that return.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks, it's helpful and the website I think is also, your website is also very helpful in terms of detail you provided there. Can you remind as to when did you post that increased detail on your website on mineral rights?", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "It was in the last iteration I believe. Within the last few months, I don't have an exact date, Pete.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. That's helpful and then.", "[Multiple speakers]", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, question for Patty, if I could, now that the Containerboard sale is closed, is it possible to narrow down the net proceeds in the 4 billion to 4.5 billion to a little finer point here?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well as I've had mentioned Pete, we just closed it yesterday and it is subject to the final working capital numbers which will be coming out at the month end close. So, we expect that you will shortly we'll be able to do that. There are working capitals, there's a construction in process, issues and clothing costs. So I wouldn't want to put a finer point on it at this point, but we will shortly.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And just last question if I could. You have indicated substantial portion of proceeds to reduce debt. Now is it possible to refine that a little bit, may be in terms of percentage of the proceeds?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, as you think about the proceeds. You start with the $6 billion then take off the final closing adjustments. We have short term debt of roughly $1 billion, maturities in `08 of about 400 million, `09 maturities are about another 600 million. So we'll be looking at those.", "As you think about the tax payment that we'll be making in December that would be in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion and then if you get to the other debt, that's outstanding and what debt we will re-purchase when we would, would really be determined by its immediate cost and its relative value. These will be the other alternatives that we have for use of funds, that's something that we are discussing with the Board on an ongoing basis.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "That's helpful. Thanks very much.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is James Armstrong calling for Chip. First question is what proportion of the third quarter Timberland income will be from land sales and what's normal?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we are estimating that we'll have approximately 20 million of land sales income during the third quarter and it varies depending on what the opportunity is, as we try to match to our 1031 exchanges. But on our ongoing basis, we've averaged over the course of the year between 80 million and 100 million in that segment.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. How much of that is... how much of the total income number would that represent on average, historically.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I am not sure I have that right off the top of my head because it varies depending all of the other components of income, but it's been in that room and we'll have to go back and take a look at what our net was over the last couple of years, certainly in the magnitude of 10% to 15%, maybe slightly higher depending on the quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Second question is, what's the tax rate going forward given both next quarter and next year following the Timber Tax Bill? Can you give us some guidance on that?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure and you think about it our income from continuing operations on a normal basis for the rest of the share, we would look at about 37ish. We will also get in addition to that, a benefit from the Timber Tax Bill for the rest of `08 in the neighborhood of $50 million to $60 million. And I don't have a number for you for '09.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Good morning. I had just a couple of questions about Timberland and then a follow-on. One question on the Timberland, Dan you've mentioned these Russian duties and how this would create more opportunities, improve your positions in China and Korea. I was just trying to figure out how bigger portion of your export log business, China and Korea really represent now, it could represent... I've always been under the impression most of your value is driven by that Japanese market with the Douglas fir?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you are absolutely correct Mark. Most of the export volumes historically has been Japan... going to Japan. And we... over the past had some shipments to China and Korea, recently the activity has picked up quite a bit as Tom talked about, because of the fact, that we found this market for our blow down timber from the storm from the last tall. Tom, could you address the pickup in volume that we've seen in Korea and China.", "Thomas F. Gideon - Executive Vice President Forest Products", "Sure, Mark in years past, we had historically had a significant presence in China and it's been minimal, I would say over the last decade. That is just now starting to pick up. Korea we have maintained, particularly a combination of both white wood as well as Douglas fir markets and it is basically tripled in the last year or so. They represent in total probably less than 15% of our total export volume going overseas at this time, but the potential there to do better going forward.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Would they be kind of similar proportion of your income from export logs, or is Japan's still kind of disproportionate because of the high price of that Doug fir?", "Thomas F. Gideon - Executive Vice President Forest Products", "Well, you're right on that, a significant part of the volume, that's going over to Korea is Hemlock, which as you know is a lower price component than Douglas fir.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. The other question I had and Dan, I understand it's a sensitive issue. But I think a lot of people are... would like to get some thoughts on the dividends, you're clearly not earning the dividend right now with the uncertain outlook for the housing market. Can you just share some general thoughts with us about how you think about the dividend?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure I preface it, as I always do, obviously it's a Board decision.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Absolutely.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "As we look at the dividend, we commented on this in New York, we've got some guidance that we provided in terms of long term percentage of cash flow. We continue to look at that and obviously our view is informed by what we may believe is the length and depth of the cycle. So, we manage the dividend with a mind towards over the cycle earnings, and Board continues to take that up on a quarterly basis. We've obviously had a significant in flow cashier, we have got the ability to pay that dividend, but longer term, that policy will continue to be reviewed and it will be fundamentally based upon our view of long term earnings potential of the business.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, thank you. I recall months ago you guys had outlined that the West Wood shipping business as an asset, were you were reviewing strategic alternatives. Can you just talk about that and how you are thinking about that business in relation to the some of the export opportunities to the Far East, that you just mentioned with regards to the Russian timber duties and so forth?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, we really view them as two separate businesses, I mean we are in the Timberlands business to the extent that we got exports of logs we maybe shipping those on our westward ships. But we ship a fair amount on third party carriers. And so there is really no particular relationship to our shipping business and our export. So best way to separate asset, we are going through a strategic view, in a sale process of the entity, and anything we do with Westwood, would not impact our ability to continue to export.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay thank you. This is kind of a technical question to the extent you can help on the call, that would be great if not, we can handle on line, I was just confused that if you look at the container board business, it looked like, it earned $105 million pre-tax, during the quarter, yet your after tax earnings from discontinued operations were $111 million. Can you just explain how that is and perhaps a breakdown of your after tax earnings from continuing... from discontinuing ops by container board versus the Australian operations?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Ross, that probably is something that we should take off line, because it does depend upon the allocation of cost to the discontinued segments. So you get a little different treatment from a breakout of on going continuing versus discontinuing.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We will be happy to give you some more detail about that as well as, the breakdown between the container board and pan [ph] Australia. We will be back later, Ross.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Thank you, I certainly appreciate that the dividend that it comes down to a Board decision. But can you share with us, if you actually reviewed the dividend with the Board since you made your comments at the mid-year investor presentations.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Mark, this is Patty, yes actually we have and as you noted or would note that at the end of June, we made the announcement to pay the dividend for the third quarter, which will be paid here later in the month of August and we won't have another decision on a dividend announcement until the fourth quarter.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And you also mentioned other alternative potentially uses, besides that pay down and again I understand that's something that is under review, would that include things like share repurchase or what are some of the alternatives, that you could potentially share with us that would get reviewed?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the Board will take all of that into consideration, Mark. We have no Board authorization at this point for a share buyback. But now that the transaction has been concluded, we have the opportunity to address, the opportunities for utilization of that cash and as Paddy mentioned, priority number one is to pay down debt, as it comes due and then provide ourselves with some flexibility as we look forward.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And then if I could follow up a little bit on the mineral rights. For instance in DeSoto County would you... I think you own about 15 or 20,000 acres there. Would you have already leased those properties or is that something that you have decision time to make and if it is something that you would consider selling, for instance in the fashion that International Paper had announced, a week or so ago. And maybe take us through your thought process of the benefits of holding on to properties, collecting royalties et cetera as opposed to outright sales and what is... or has been at least until very recently, a very hot market.", "Thomas F. Gideon - Executive Vice President Forest Products", "Sure, Mark this is Tom. We don't have quite the number of acres that you described to us in the DeSoto Parish itself. We have a much smaller component inside of that and a portion of those certainly are under these current leases. And as Dan mentioned in his remarks earlier, we continue to look at, what are the best options and in some cases that looks for a favorable lease arrangement, that has a significant participation in the royalty stream and we certainly will entertain options including either equity participation and/or as the sale, if that's what's the best thing for the return of the shareholder.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And is there anyway that you will be able to overtime perhaps provide us with parameters or help us better assess, what the opportunities, the value opportunity in the mineral rights area might be?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think Mark, we can provide some additional level of disclosure. Certainly getting the sense from comments that people feel like we have not done, so we can't get into any proprietary information and obviously valuation is driven significantly by prices of whatever those assets maybe. Recently we have seen a significant run up in energy prices and that creates a different view of valuation. But I think the next time we get together, we can share some more of that information and try to give you a better sense and rest of those on the call and our investors how we think through this.", "As I mentioned historically, we have maintained and owned these mineral rights, we actively managed them. We do a lot of leasing, but we are not averse to outright sale and/or joint venture. So we take all of that into consideration and those decisions will be informed certainly by values of... not only we put on them. But certainly others put on them.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Very helpful thank you. And just one real last quick one. The Corporate was a plus 10 on chart 13, I know you had mentioned something about foreign exchange gains and lower variable comp. On a go forward basis, what type of number, should we be thinking about for Corporate?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think Mark, on an ongoing basis, the Corporate segment has been about... if you take out the abnormal pieces that we have looked at around $40 million. Now we are adjusting those numbers based on some of the right sizing and restructuring that we are doing and we will try and give you some additional clarity on that on that as we go forward.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay.Thank you.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Thank you, a very specific question and then a more broader one, on the wood --", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Mark, could you speak up a bit please?", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Can you hear me better?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's better, Mark, thank you.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Right, sorry about that. I am just wondering, if you can give us a sense within the wood products divisions, you obviously were able to narrow the loss and I am wondering are there specific areas or regions, where the losses are bigger or is there anything still left to work on, short of closing assets down.", "My second question is, its more broadly you guys have had a pretty good read on the OSP business over the next... last couple of years, Steve Rogel was very cautious about all the new capacity coming on and I am curious now the do you see this business as right for consolidation over the next year or two. And how strategically important is that business to Weyerhaeuser on the long side or the short side?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well Mark, as you look on the materials. We saw significant improvement across our wood products businesses in the second quarter, saw good response on the demand in some of our product lines, mixed and others. Some modest price improvement from lumber and OSP. And we continue to... as we talked on previous occasions to have balanced our productive capability against what the demand signals are to us.", "In addition, we continue to work on the fundamentals, in terms of taking costs out of our business, in terms of spending SG&A, staffing associated with some of our curtailments or ship positive changes and so it's really a continuation of all those efforts that accounted for what you saw in the second quarter.", "Mark, in terms of your question about strategic importance. We are significant player in the OSP business, it is a product that is included in our structural frame design that we market through our wood products, I-level solution, the primary strategic asset in our wood products business continues to be our lumber business. Because we believe that adds value to our timberlands position, especially in the south. As we look at the other wood products, that we manufacture, our engineered products. We believe that they help to round out, the solution and at this point, it's a part of our strategic asset set. But we evaluate those businesses on a going basis.", "And it is conceivable that some of that product could be outsourced, we probably don't even have the ability to make all of the OSP that we sell. But I think that industry will likely go through some continued consolidations, as we work through current housing cycle. There have been a lot of mills, that have been shut down and it's likely you will continue to see some changes in that industry.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "It's very helpful. Thank you.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Thanks. Good morning. first question, containerboard, previously you had a run rate of around 70 million and depreciation at over 61 million, I think Q1, is it right to say that had you included depreciation would have around 45 million in operating earnings. So really it wasn't an improvement sequentially?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Steve that would be correct, we had those earnings of about 45 million for the Q2.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Okay. So all right, that's interesting. And also I see that SG&A is already down quite substantially, not before container board, it was sold and presumably before any material head count reduction at headquarters. So can you explain what's happening there?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We took some initiatives last year, to start to make some significant changes to SG&A. And I think we identified last year opportunities to drop that number by about a $100 million. As we have embarked on these effort that I talked about this morning, where we identified potential 375... that's primarily corporate staff, but as the market has slowed, our SG&A has come down, and our operating businesses pretty significantly as you might imagine given the curtailments and shut downs of mills, with products business, and the decline in volume in our home building business. So it's a volume related answer with respect to our businesses, but we've been addressing the indirect and the corporate support aspect, as we've moved along.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "So, I think when I took out all the puts and takes on the Corporate side, it was $10 million worth of contribution. Are you guys now profit centered?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well Mark, if you look at the various pieces of the puts and takes there are some rather abnormal pieces that you really do have to sort out. We tried to give you some additional clarity on that as you look at the release and also in the remarks. So you've got some pension income in there, you've got the restructuring in Uruguay which as Cathy mentioned, is really just a step up in the book basis, as a result of the dissolution of our joint venture there.", "So I wouldn't say that our corporate centre is a profit centre, but we have been very focused on cutting cost in all areas that we can.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Great. Thanks, Patty. Thanks very much,", "Patricia M. Bedient - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You bet.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Roberts Brown [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, good morning. Thank you. Follow up on Mark's question on wood products. I think last quarter, you had guided to an expecting a lower operating loss in that segment, but I think you know they're like modestly improving lumber prices, and maybe other costs that as a $70 million positive variance, it's actually appreciably well. And I'm wondering what specifically was better than what you expected?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think we were pleasantly surprised by the improvement in pricing, particularly across our lumber and OSB during the quarter. As you can tell volumes were basically overall on mix, so significant prices and we'd actually seen before results. Year-over-year, we've taken out $150 million in cost out of this business, as I mentioned in terms of all of that activities we've been engaged upon.", "So we started to see some of the benefits from that as well.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay I guess just follow up to that what is your actual operating rate right now. I know you had mentioned 50% or so and it will less I assume what actual was the operating rate during the quarter, was?", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Again if you go back, I think we are saying and we haven't change license for materially represented it may add less. We're about 70% in our lumber and 50% approximately ball park in OSP and our internet products.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and then just in the Real Estate segment, what was your cancellation rate during the quarter.", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "I think it was just a little over 30%. It's on travel revenue.", "[multiple speakers]", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, Okay, thank you. And then just lastly on pulp, I think you note that 15,000 tons of value, you think you have lost in volumes because [inaudible] the expected sale will continue going forward.", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "While, we certainly hope it doesn't but we have this isn't the first we have experienced to delay shipments in this year. If it's something that is high on our authority list to ensure that our shipments go out as planned and again we are working on issue, diligently.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay so you guys, in the quarter, you think it will sort out correct or not get bad?", "Lawrence B. Burrows - President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company", "No, it's still a difficult situation, it's hard to even speculate exactly how it'll end up. Again we're working at it as best as we can and certainly it's our intention not to have any future delays.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. All right, thanks very much guys.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "We have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from George Staphos, Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks, hi guys. may be a bigger picture question, to conclude, Dan, I think you mentioned at the beginning of call that you now have the right portfolio to make the right decisions at the right time. I'm paraphrasing a little bit here, as we should think about it, is the platform now appropriately sized and we're merely waiting on the cycle as the catalyst for your next decisions within the portfolio or do you need to perhaps even tack on to the portfolio before you make the next steps in Weyerhaeuser's evolution. Thanks.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, George. We can expect that there would continue to be some further fine tuning of the portfolio. As we continue to narrow down to our core assets, what we have talked about is that our fundamental foundation is built on our Timberlands, to that we add our wood products business, our cellulose fibers business and our real estate business.", "And we have got other assets, that we add over the years, including some that we have recently sold such as Australia. And we have talked about our shipping business and our rail roads. So we have got some smaller non core businesses, where we still have an opportunity to fine tune the portfolio.", "As we look forward to '09 and '10. I mean we are really, looking for some turnaround that we know will come and in the housing cycle, which will give us some strength in our wood products business and our real estate business, it will give us some additional flexibility.", "Our focus at this point to improve the operational excellence of every single business that we got. We will make it more valuable for us, where ultimately, we determine that there was a better sponsor for any of those businesses, it would make those businesses more valuable. So... go ahead.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Could the fine turning include growing, if you have the right valuations parameters or turn parameters, growing within the Timberland business and in a significant way,", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It...would absolutely include potential to grow.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Long-term, what we are trying to do is to narrow the focus of the portfolio, to right size the support organization that supports these businesses and to get on a solid footing for growth in the future. So we're going through this process of narrowing focus, that we started with paper and now into container board. We've got some smaller business activities. We'll get to a solid core here and then we'll make a decision about the appropriate structure to support those businesses as we go forward.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Thank you very much.", "Daniel S. Fulton - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. That concludes the call we appreciate all of the questions and I just wanted to reiterate a couple of key points that we made. We've been through this downsizing process, especially with paper and container board. We're following that with our corporate restructuring, that we know is necessary, I've been really excited about how quickly, we've been able to address that issue and then you'll start to see results already this year and then following through the next year.", "We got a great leadership team; we are going to be positioned, as we move forward. As we talk and Larry talked about the housing market, we expect the housing market is going to be tough for a while. But I think we have gone through most of the downsizing in the businesses that participate in that industry and I think as we come out of this, we are going to be in good shape and... so the focus on '09 is to continue to squeeze cost to improve operational performance, creating flexibility and optionality for us, as we move forward. And we are expecting to start to see some market improvement, end of '09 and into '010, and we are going to be positioned for it.", "So, I thank you very much time for your time and attention today and as always, if there are questions you can follow up with Kathy.", "Kathryn F. McAuley - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you very much for joining. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Weyerhaeuser 2008 second quarter earnings conference call.

Davidson & Co.", "Anna Torma - Soleil Securities", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "Operator", "Good morning ladies and gentlemen, thank you of standing by. Welcome to the Weyerhaeuser 2008 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded today Friday, February 6, 2009.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Thank you, Brandy. Good morning. Welcome to Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. I'm Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tom Gideon, Executive Vice President, Forest Products; and Larry Burrows, President, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.", "The call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release and material for this call can be found at the website or by contacting April Meier at 253-924-2937. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.", "This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of $1.212 billion or $5.73 per share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.8 billion. This includes an $827 million or $3.91 per diluted share goodwill impairment in our iLevel and Cellulose Fibers businesses writing off all of the goodwill in these businesses, real estate impairment related after-tax charges of $313 million or $1.48 per diluted share, an after tax gain of $149 million or $0.70 per diluted share on the ownership restructuring of asset in Uruguay, an after-tax charge of $33 million or $0.15 per diluted share for closure and restructuring activities in wood products and corporate activity, an after tax gain of $21 million or $0.10 per diluted share for early extinguishment of debt.", "Excluding these items, the company had a net loss after tax of $209 million or a loss $0.99 per share. A GAAP reconciliation of special items is available on our website in the earnings information package.", "Please turn to chart four in the earnings information package as I will discuss the waterfall chart. Chart four is the bar chart detailing the changes in the contribution to earnings by segment from the third quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2008. This is presented on the basis of contribution to earnings before special items, interest and taxes.", "As noted in the first bar on chart four in the third quarter 2008, the company earned $17 million before special items, interest and taxes. Changes in Weyerhaeuser's segment earnings from the third quarter to the fourth quarter were as follows. Proceeding from left to the right across the waterfall chart, we begin the discussion with Timberland.", "No land sales and reduced timber volumes resulted in lower Timberland's earnings of $45 million. Significant declines in number and OSP prices, and weak volumes throughout our product lines were the main contributors to the $90 million reduction in wood products earnings.", "Falling coal prices and market related downtime reduced cellulose fiber earnings by $13 million. There was no Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling activity in the fourth quarter. Whereas the third quarter contained one month of CBPR earnings. This had a negative $8 million impact. The loss on land sales at Weyerhaeuser Real Estate companies of $130 million was the most significant factor in the $62 million decline in retail earnings.", "Corporate and other contributed $12 million less. Foreign exchange was the largest factor in reduced earnings.", "The final bar at the right of the page is the fourth quarter 2008 pre-tax loss before special items of $213 million. Please note chart one in information package contains the actual Q3 and Q4 contributions to earnings by segment excluding special items, interest, expenses and taxes.", "Lastly I want to point out that our tax rate for the continuing op -- for continuing operations for the year is now approximately 41%. This excludes Uruguay restructuring gains and the goodwill impairment.", "I'll now turn the call over to Dan Fulton.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thank you, Kathy. And good morning to everyone on the call. When I spoke to you in December, I mentioned the conditions in all of our markets had significantly deteriorated since the end of the third quarter. I'd also said these were some of the worse conditions in my career, and we foresaw a continued weakening of the economy.", "As this morning's sobering results indicate that prediction came true. Single family new home construction has nearly come to a standstill. During the fourth quarter alone, annual construction plummeted to a rate we haven't seen since 1959.", "Not only have we seen a 77% drop in housing starts since 2005's peak level of 1.7 million but the pace of this decline has accelerated. By 2007, starts had fallen to a level of 1 million. In 2008, they plunged to 620,000 and by December, starts had dropped to an annualized rate of 398,000.", "Story in the repair and remodel market is the same. Tighter credit and fears of possible unemployment have caused people to delay projects they might have undertaken only a few months ago. As a result, with products are barely moving and what is selling is going for prices substantially below third quarter levels.", "These figures demonstrate the complete capitulation of the consumer in the last half of the fourth quarter. It's not surprising. Consumer confidence has now soaked to its lowest levels ever as buyers face an environment of uncertainty.", "They wonder what congress will do and if its action will help stem this free fall. Everybody they read thousands of job cuts and wonder if they're next. In this environment, even qualified buyers have decided to sit on the sidelines rather than take advantage of lower home prices.", "Such conditions obviously affect our Real Estate, Wood Products and Timberland businesses. But the bad news doesn't stop there. Over the past couple of years, Cellulose Fibers has provided a bright spot due to our competitiveness and a weaker dollar. However, the rebound in the US dollar during the quarter, combined with increased weakness of the global economy took its toll on pulp prices.", "All of our markets are facing extremely difficult conditions. In response, we have moved to align our production to the rapidly deteriorating markets and to lower cost. At the moment, Tom Gideon and Larry Burrows will outline in detail the actions they've taken and will take in the coming months. Patty Bedient will provide the first quarter outlook and explain the goodwill charges that we reported this morning.", "Based on today's results, it may seem hard to believe that the steps we've taken so far have made a difference. But we're dealing with a market that's weakening faster than anyone envisioned. So far, we have taken steps to reduce overhead by 375 million and have eliminated significant production.", "We recognize that these are unprecedented conditions which require an unprecedented response. We are accelerating the necessary and tough decisions to get us through this protracted down cycle and to position ourselves for the market upturn.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom and Larry who will go through their specific areas in detail. Tom, I believe you're first.", "Thomas F. Gideon", "Thanks Dan. As you've just heard, we're facing some extraordinarily challenging markets and we're committed to taking the necessary steps to improve our performance under these conditions.", "In this portion of the call, I'd like to detail some of the actions we are implementing in our Wood Products, Cellulose Fibers, and Timberland businesses. Because our Wood Products business was the most heavily affected by the current financial situation, I will spend most of my time discussing what we're doing in that business.", "However, be assured each business in the forest product segment is responding to this need to act with the same discipline and sense of urgency. Prices in sales volumes for building materials fell during the fourth quarter. As we have throughout this downturn, we continue to make operating adjustments to balance our production with declining demand.", "Today, virtually all of our facilities are experiencing some degree of reduced operation; both lumber and OSP are now running at a rate approaching 50% of capacity. For engineered products, we are operating our mills at less than one-third of their capacity.", "Since the market peak in 2005, North American lumber demand has dropped 30%. During the same period Weyerhaeuser production has declined 32%. In addition to volume impact, we've also seeing significant price decline. For example, we have not seen Douglas-fir fir pricing at these low levels in 25 years. In response, we are monitoring demand and supply on a weekly basis and making real time adjustments to our operating schedules to more aggressively mange our response to these unprecedented market conditions.", "In addition to modifying operating postures, we are also making tough decisions about permanent capacity. In just the past 11 days, we have announced the closure or indefinite curtailment of lumber and veneer operations at four mills in Aberdeen, Washington; and Pine Hill, Alabama. These are in addition to the seven operations we either closed or indefinitely curtailed in 2008. In the coming weeks, we will continue to assess the market situation and make additional operating decisions as appropriate.", "From January 2008 through today, we have eliminated approximately 2700 positions in our iLevel business due to closures, sales or modified postures or nearly 25%, of our total operational and staff roles. This translates into a total reduction of $175 million in payroll costs. For 2009, we've reduced our capital spending by 50%. We will continue to fund only those projects critical to maintaining optimal and operating performance, ensure safety and meet environmental regulations. We have restricted or eliminated discretionary expenses such as travel and training and all in all we are challenging all of our employees to find ways of doing every aspect of their jobs faster, better, cheaper and of course safer.", "Our immediate goal is straightforward; to get to a core set of operations that can be cash neutral in this severely depressed market. These assets will then serve as the platform or significant operating returns when the marked rebounds. While we firmly believe that the long-term prospects for residential housing demand are strong, we recognize the current conditions in the home building industry warrants severe cost conservation actions. That is why we were taking unprecedented steps across all areas of our business to save cost.", "Turing to Cellulose Fibers, prices and volume declined due to the dramatic changes in global market conditions. We continue to improve our operating efficiencies into the quarter. This was offset by the sudden severe declines in market pulp prices and demand. In response we adjusted our production to meet declining demand and reduced production by 16,000 tons. We will continue to match production with demand by appropriately adjusting capacity utilization.", "In November, we began actions to dramatically reduce our spending in key areas, including overtime, chemical usage, enterprising, staffing and the use of outside contractors. We expect to start seeing the results of these actions this quarter. In addition, we've reduced 2009 capital. Combined with these caps -- these cost reduction actions, we believe Cellulose Fibers is well positioned to meet these challenging market conditions, given our efficient operations and strong presence in the fluff, pulp, and specialty fiber markets.", "Moving to Timberlands, we are dealing with lower harvest levels in response to deteriorating market demand. Harvest levels in the fourth quarter were down approximately 13% from the third quarter due to market declines and adverse weather conditions. For the year, harvest levels were essentially flat to 2007. It should be noted however that nearly one third of the harvest in the west was associated with the need to harvest wood damage by the severe storms that struck the northwest in December 2007.", "Following the reduction in demand, domestic log prices were also lower while export realizations were up slightly as our export markets remain steady. Volumes to Japan were comparable to 2007 levels. During 2008, we took advantage of our experience in Asia to expand our sales to the Korean Hemlock market. We had improved lease revenue from minerals during the fourth quarter, primarily for leases originating in the Hainesville shale region.", "Looking across the entire company, I would dearly miss if I didn't recognize our employees for their outstanding safety performance in 2008. We had our safest year ever and turning fewer and less severe injuries than ever before. Given the market and operational challenges we faced this past year, this was truly a superior achievement on their part. And now I'll turn the call over to Larry.", "Lawrence B. Burrows", "Thank you Tom, good morning. As Dan mentioned, what started as a dramatic deterioration in the housing and financial markets, is now significantly affecting the overall economy. Rising unemployment and economic uncertainty have driven consumer confidence to the lowest levels since the index began in 1967.", "The supply of customers has become very limited as potential home buyers have lost confidence to make major purchase. Against this backdrop, foreclosure activity is accelerating, driving up inventories of unsold home and placing downward pressure on prices which continue to decline in all markets.", "Conditions in our markets have eroded considerably in recent months. For the middle of last year, there were signs that the Washington D.C. market, one of the first to enter the downturn might begin to stabilize. Any hopes of stabilization was dashed during the fourth quarter with the rise of unemployment and the collapse of consumer confidence.", "Phoenix, Las Vegas and the Inland Empire in California remain our most challenged markets. The Houston and Pacific Northwest markets which had remained relatively steady through the third quarter and now deteriorating. This deterioration is evidenced in our key indicators on chart nine.", "Comparing the fourth quarter of 2008 to -- through 2007, traffic decreased 33%, sales fell 44% and closings were off 53%. Our backlog of homes sold but not closed dropped to slightly more than two months. Our average sales price was down 13% from 2007, consistent with a 15% new home price decline nationally.", "In the past we've discussed the actions we are taking to adjust to this difficult operating environment. We have cut land acquisition and land development spending, adjusted staffing, reduced work in progress, closed communities and repositioned others with smaller, less expensive product.", "Efforts in all of these areas are ongoing, but are insufficient. We reviewed our homebuilding projects, land portfolio for opportunities to generate cash and avoid future development spending. This effort and the increasingly uncertain timing of recovery resulted in the change in our land strategy for certain projects. We decided to sell the land rather than hold it for development.", "Consistent with this strategy in the fourth quarter, we sold land, eliminated option and impaired land identified for future sale. These land related activities account for 469 million of our 630 million fourth quarter pre-tax loss as follows.", "$130 million from divesting land in Arizona and California, 58 million from eliminating options on land in virtually all of our markets and 280 million from impairing land we are likely to sell in the future. This land is located in Arizona, California, Nevada and the Pacific Northwest. An additional 135 million in asset impairments relates to communities where we continue to operate. We also incurred restructuring charges of 10 million. Excluding the loss on land sales and the non-cash charges I just discussed, RECO recorded a loss of 16 million on fourth quarter operations.", "Our local managers are experienced and capable and together we will successfully guide RECO through the exceptionally difficult operating conditions we continue to experience. The actions we are taking position us to generate cash and return to profitability as our markets stabilize and recover.", "I will now turn the call over to Patty.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thanks Larry, and good morning. Well, as you've already heard the start of the year has been exceedingly challenging and we expect it will continue throughout the quarter. I'll begin the outlook with Timberland.", "Fee harvest volume is expected to decrease in both the west and south. Traditionally the first quarter is seasonally weaker than the fourth, and the market curtailments and shutdowns in mills across all geographies will only serve to exacerbate this trend. In the West, export prices are expected to decline due to the slowing Japanese housing market. Domestic realizations should remain weak. Prices realized in the South are anticipated to decrease although we anticipate a higher mix of grade log compared to the fourth quarter.", "We expect logging and handling cost to be somewhat less due to lower diesel cost and improved salvage cost in the west. Overall we expect the Timberlands earnings will be comparable to the fourth quarter. In wood products, prices and volumes across all product lines continued to be anemic. No curtailments in our geographies and product lines as Tom described are expected to be the norm as we adjust production to low demand level. Further shutdowns are likely if markets do not improve. As a result we expect that first quarter operating losses could be similar to the fourth quarter. Pulp prices and sales volumes are expected to decrease in the first quarter as the deterioration in consumer products and Asian markets continues.", "Production volumes are being adjusted to lower levels of demand which is expected to negatively affect operating efficiency. We will also have additional maintenance expense in the first quarter compared to the fourth as a result of scheduled annual maintenance. We do expect lower freight cost resulting from decreasing fuel surcharges and ocean freight.", "In addition fiber costs should be lower. However these cost decreases will not be enough to offset adverse market trends. We expect that overall operating earnings in the Cellulose Fibers segment for the first quarter will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter.", "In our real estate segment we expect that first quarter home closing will be seasonally lower than the fourth quarter. In addition the lack of demand that Larry has just described is not expected to improve as unemployment continues to be high and consumer confidence remains fragile. Low sales orders and high cancellation rates have been prevalent thus far in the quarter.", "Excluding impairments and losses on land sales which we experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect that the segment's loss from home building operations will increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth. Capital spending for Weyerhaeuser Company for the full year of 2008 was approximately $425 million. This included approximately 100 million for the containerboard packaging business we sold last August. As announced in December, we anticipate spending in the range of 200 to $250 million in 2009.", "Now as Dan mentioned, I'll provide some additional background on our goodwill impairments as well as other significant changes in equity during the quarter. Included in the loss of 1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, our non-cash charges of 827 million for goodwill write-offs associated with our Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products businesses.", "The accelerating deterioration in market conditions during the fourth quarter led to a fair value analysis which indicated that the carrying value of the goodwill was impaired. The analysis takes into account the industry's reduced market multiples, recent and expected operating performance and an expectation that weak macro economic trends will likely continue.", "After recording these impairments and according with financial accounting standards 142, the goodwill remaining on our balance sheet is approximately $40 million and is associated with our Timberland segment. At year-end, we also updated the funded status of our pension and post retirement benefit plans.", "Investment losses primarily in the second half of 2008 and a lowering of the discount rate resulted in an after-tax charge to equity of approximately $1.2 billion. Other changes in equity included the fourth quarter dividend payment of $127 million in addition to the approval of $53 million for the dividend that the board declared in December and which is payable in March. Changes in foreign currency translation accounted for the reminder of the decrease.", "In addition, we ended the year with $2.4 billion in cash and short-term investment and $6 billion in debt. This follows the retirement of $800 million of debt in the quarter. We remain in compliance with our debt covenants and we have available unused lines of credit totaling $2.2 billion.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thank you, Patty. I acknowledge the significance of our $1.2 billion loss. It reflects the speed and the severity of the deterioration of the economy especially in our markets. We're well aware of the challenges our markets present and we're taking action. Each of us is taking responsibility to accelerate our cost savings measures. We're questioning every expenditure and challenging ourselves to work more efficiently. There is no silver bullet here but we're confident that our focus will produce measurable results even in these economic conditions.", "We have a great asset in our Timberlands. Our businesses operate in markets that are anchored by sound long-term demographics. Consumer confidence will return, credit markets will ease, and we will see a rebound. In the meantime, we're dealing with current markets and the uncertain timing of recovery.", "We will improve our performance and put ourselves in the strongest position for the future. I have no doubt that we'll succeed. Now I'd like to open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). And we have a question from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Securities", "Hi, good morning.", "Daniel Fulton", "Good morning Gail.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Securities", "I guess just starting on the timber segment, if a third of 2008 volumes were salvage and I am assuming you are running through that activity. How should we think about harvest volumes and mix in 2009?", "Thomas Gideon", "Gail this is Tom. And looking to 2009 in the west you'll see a lower harvest level and it will be more aligned towards Douglas-fir as apposed to Hemlock.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Securities", "Okay. And can you give any sort of visibility into, I guess, part of the change in the fourth quarter was one off land sales just a magnitude of land sales between the third and fourth quarter and all of 2008?", "Thomas Gideon", "Well as we indicated, we did not have any land and adjustment program sales in 2008 at 8.4 (ph) during the fourth quarter. We are in the market on an ongoing basis, and so the difference was that as we looked at the opportunities that -- there wasn't a match in timing between the assets that we were looking to the purchase and opportunities that we felt comfortable with exchanging for. So we had nothing in the fourth quarter.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Securities", "Okay but you did in third, correct?", "Thomas Gideon", "Yes.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Securities", "Okay. And just looking on the Cellulose business, the weakness that you referred to in emerging market was that more a commodity pulp or was that across the board including fluff?", "Thomas Gideon", "It was primarily in the paper grade segment which obviously over time has an impact and flows over to some degree on the fluff producers as well. As we are predominantly into market pulp -- excuse me, the reserve in pulp and specialty fiber markets but we weren't new into the slowdown in the Asian markets.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Securities", "Okay and then Patty just a quick question. Can you remind us what the cash tax payments on the IP sale was in the quarter?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well we pay taxes on our total in all-in taxes Gail. So the total cash taxes that we paid out in the quarter were just over $1 billion.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Patricia Bedient", "Next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you, good morning, Tom could you just talk about your comment that you made with regards to getting to cash neutral in the Wood Products business and what are some of the steps that you think you could take and what the timing might be in order to get there?", "Thomas Gideon", "Well as you can Richard our goal is to do this quicker rather than later. The whole issue that we have is, is we really want to be cash positive and earnings positive, but during these extreme market conditions, our first goal is to make sure we're cash neutral in all of our operations that we continue to run.", "So we're continuing to look again against what we see as expected demand, against the customer commitments that we have, and against the facilities that most logistically advantage and cost effectively can meet those demands that we want to continue to fulfill.", "So it's an ongoing process of looking at every element of our business both our operating postures as well as the markets and the channel that we wish to go through as well as all of the dimensions of overhead expenses and spending that we can take a look at. So everything that is associated with operating and manufacturing businesses has been scrutinized.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "And then just on the recent move up in wood products, specifically lumber prices, you think, and it's only happened in this most recent week where lumber prices have moved up pretty sharply. Do you think that that's something that's just a seasonal factor or is that driven by something else? Do you think that's sustainable? Can you maybe give some comment on that?", "Thomas Gideon", "Well I wouldn't want to speculate in this market but there was a slight increase in some of our lumber pricing. But again, as we look at the economic situation and the market conditions, we don't see an ongoing uplift in the lumber prices going forward.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then if I can just ask one question for Patty, just with regards to pension. Can you just give us some detail with regards to what the status was at the end of the year in terms of funded status and what the pension income looks like for 2009?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure Rick. As you know, at the end of 2007, our qualified plans were over-funded by almost $2 billion and our investment performance for 2008 was a loss of approximately 30%. Now our largest plans are US qualified plans and some of those plans are over funded and some are under funded by about a similar amount.", "For those that are under funded, we don't expect to be required to make a cash contribution until the end of 2010 probably around September. The amount is still an estimate but could be in the range of 50 to $100 million.", "In terms of income going forward, we're still in the process of our estimating that number subject to the year-end numbers. But we will have pension income during 2009.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays. Please go ahead", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Thank you and good morning. Just following up on that last question, Patty, I was hoping you could clarify. So the over-funded status of I think 1.9 billion, the planned assets came down 30%, what was the net effect?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well the net effect of the plans at the end of the year and you will see all of this detail in a couple of weeks as we filed the 10-K. But we have -- I am speaking primarily about the U.S. qualified plans because those are by far in a way our largest plan. And some of those, as I mentioned, that our over-funded, still over-funded some are under-funded by about a similar amount. I think it swings around $300 million.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Shifting gears to the Real Estate businesses, was hoping you can provide a little more color on the charges in terms of how much of the charges were cash charges versus non-cash charges? And what I am really trying to get out is how much was the cash burned for Real Estate business in the quarter?", "Daniel Fulton", "Peter --", "Lawrence Burrows", "On this --", "Daniel Fulton", "I am sorry, go ahead.", "Lawrence Burrows", "As I said, I believe that most of the charges related to land write-downs that should be a non-cash item; just trying to separate between the cash and non-cash charges.", "Lawrence Burrows", "I would say that the majority, in terms of, obviously the impairments we took which was a large portion of it -- it was non-cash; obviously the sale, was a little bit different. The 130 million came from selling the land, 58 million was money and cash that we walked away from in terms of auction deposits and what not. The $280 million of land that we are likely to sell in the future obviously was a non-cash charge. The severance of about $10 million will be a cash charge.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. That's very helpful. And shifting gears to the interest expense, Patty, it was a little bit higher than I expected. Curious if you can provide a little more color on that in terms of maybe interest expense, interest income. And do you have any guidance for us for either the first quarter or for full year '09 based on where you stand today?", "Patricia Bedient", "Yeah, the interest expense will come down simply because the debt is coming down. But I think really the change in the interest expense probably wasn't so much the interest expense itself, Pete, but the fact that we capitalize less interest in the fourth quarter compared to the third.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Last question --", "Patricia Bedient", "What we refer (ph) as the net.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Last question, I'll turn it over. I see the international operations are now reported in the Timber segment. Is it possible to give us the performance of that piece of that business in the fourth quarter and for 2008?", "Thomas Gideon", "Yes. In the fourth quarter I think we saw about $10 million loss in the International segment that was primarily driven by the product prices reduction that we experienced globally for the plywood that was being produced at our new operation down there. We also saw some increased depletion as a result of the step-up in basis, as a result of the partition, and some foreign exchange impact.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Patricia Bedient", "You'll see the break-out of those as we go forward Pete in the 10-K.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Thanks Patty.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. I wonder Tom and Patty if you could just help us unwind the timberland situation a little bit more. Tom I think you said that a third of the OA western harvest volume was salvage logging. Is that right?", "Thomas Gideon", "That's correct.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "And how much of the volume that you harvest in total across the company is western?", "Thomas Gideon", "I'd have to look at it. It's probably around 40% but I have to give back to you exactly on that amount, Mark.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Another question, I noticed that your year-over-year kind of depletion in unit volume in timberland was up about 10% and that your third party log sales were up about 20 or 25%. And I just -- I'm trying to understand why this is away from the salvage logging that this is occurring when the lumber and wood products markets are down so sharply in terms of both volume and price?", "Thomas Gideon", "What you'd see in some degree is that with less internal sales and more went to third parties as again we had a good export market and we increased some of our sales over into Korea with the salvage Hemlock that we had.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So of it's -- so most of the increased volume is going into the export market, it's not domestic sales?", "Thomas Gideon", "I wouldn't say most of it, I'll just say a good portion of it.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "I guess I'm just to trying to understand kind of -- it seems like you would almost aside from your desire to generate cash in the near-term, like there's a market where you'd actually want to be pulling your harvest volumes back pretty significantly?", "Thomas Gideon", "Yeah, again, when you look at that, our primary goals, particularly in the west was to get the value from the wood that was blown down and to get that into cash as quickly as we could otherwise it would have been sitting out there and degrading on an ongoing basis. So you did see that significant volume come in and it was good for us and the shareholders that we were able early in the year to get that into the market place before the degradation occurred out in the woods.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then switching over to Real Estate, with the land sales that you've identified out of the -- out of RECO, can you give us some sense of what your land book is likely to look at, look like after those sales are complete?", "Lawrence Burrows", "Mark this is Larry. Help me understand when you --", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Well unlike -- you're getting rid of some of your existing land position. Once you complete the sales that you are looking at right now, what will you be sitting on in the way of land inventory?", "Lawrence Burrows", "We have consistently said that we had a little bit longer land inventory than others maybe in the 7-year range; I think that were probably a little bit longer than that right now just given what's happening and so we're essentially looking to kind of work back roughly to about that kind of range level.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Is there any chance going forward just so that we can help both of us as the analyst and investors understand the company? Is there any chance we can get more color on where exactly the land book sits in and how much is there? So, I think one of the big questions people have right now is really trying to figure out how to value real estate. And if we don't really have any more information on what the portfolio looks like, it's kind of hard to do that?", "Daniel Fulton", "Mark this is Dan. We can do that. And as you know we've also committed that we are going to provide an increase level of disclosure in our Timberland segment. You can look for that in the 10-K and our annual investor guidance. And then you can provide some feedback to us as to whether or not it's helpful. But we will attempt to address your questions on the RECO land because we consider to be a significant asset and obviously better understanding is helpful.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, okay. And then my last question. Dan, is it possible to get an update on asset sales? I think you've -- you'd pulled the sale of the shipping business but as I understood it the sale of the short-line railroads was still in progress and I don't know whether you've added anything else to that asset sale. So could we go little update on that?", "Daniel Fulton", "We had three assets that we had announced processes on. One was as you mentioned the Westwood Shipping which we pulled off the markets for two reasons; one was just a general deterioration and ocean shipping business across the world, and secondly the financial market just made it impossible for any respective buyer to be able to pay what we thought was a reasonable price as business that's make money for us. And so we are going to hold it for time being. I can't comment on the railroad process; we are continuing to be in discussion and negotiation with potential buyer but can't provide a specific update. And then the third business that we announced that we had a letter of intent was our commercial I-Beam business. And once again I can't provide any update other than we are still in discussion with the potential buyer.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Would you consider on any other assets Dan? Would you consider like creating some joint ventures because it just seems like if the real estate market is not going to come back quickly, the deal with some of the oversupply that we've got in a lot of the building products markets that maybe some joint ventures would be wasted to start to get at more of that?", "Daniel Fulton", "We would not rule it out. One of the issues that we have generally in the wood products business is fundamental over capacity and so the industry has continued to take downtime and curtailment and both temporary and permanent closures. So, we're open to discussion but we have no ongoing discussions at this point of time.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "All right, thanks Dan and I do appreciate the commitment to more information, more transparency.", "Patricia Bedient", "Next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Weyerhaeuser(sic) [Buckingham Research]. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Thank you.", "Daniel Fulton", "Mark, did you change your employment?", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Yeah, I was kind of interested by that too. On the land, you mentioned that you roped down or mark-to-market land where you expect to build on, I'm sorry, what you expect to sell. Does that mean that you didn't on land which you at some date might develop? I wasn't quite sure with that distinction you were making there was?", "Daniel Fulton", "Mark, the distinction was is that we went back and we kind of looked at our portfolio. There was some land in our -- land portfolio that we said you know what, I think that we may be better off selling this rather than holding it to develop in the future and again this is a function of kind of looking at maybe a protracted difficult operating environment. And so what we did is we wrote that land down and anticipate being able to take that to market in sometime of this year. Likely it would be in the series of transactions and probably this is not something that will happen probably quickly. It would probably play itself out over the several quarters.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "So, can -- where you have on the balance sheet, you have land being processed for development and which is at $1.12 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. That would -- would that have been first of all where the write-downs would have shown up did the land you are talking about here?", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes I believe so. I think we also took some impairments approximately $135 million relating to communities and land where we are continuing to operate in belts. There's a little bit of both.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Understood. And how much -- can you help us at all understand how much of the land did not get a look through. So -- or -- and the one way we would get to that number is you told us what the write-down was, where did this land that you wrote down; where did it end up on the book side.", "Daniel Fulton", "I am trying to understand your question. You're talking about -- well first of all, every quarter, we go through a process where we look at our land held for impairments and we go through that. So everything gets looked at on a quarterly basis, the degree to which either we've had a change in strategy is the one that we've just outlined where we decided to go ahead and sell land or because of market conditions, things continued to deteriorate. That's when we would elect to take impairment. And you know the land that we are going to sell in the future -- projected to sell in the future, would go underneath, the real-estate in process of development and for sale. That's what shows up.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. The -- and I guess --", "Daniel Fulton", "Let me also -- I'll mention one other thing, the majority of what we ended up impairing is land that we acquired typically that has been in run up which is really kind of 2002 and beyond.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Right. And I can guess what I'm really trying to get to is get a sense as to how mark-to-market, how good the book value on the real estate business is which kind of I guess goes back to Mark Wilde's point, more information for us to be able to better assess would be very helpful cause -- and obviously you've still got a pretty big book value there, but in this type of market, people I think are unclear whether or not it's really got that type of value. So any help you can do would be great.", "And just a quick follow-up on the pension expense, I do assume that pension income would be meaningfully lower than the 177 in 2008. Would that be true or not necessarily?", "Patricia Bedient", "Yeah, I think that's a fair statement, Mark, and again we'll get you that number. It will be out in the 10-K here in a couple of weeks.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And then lastly how much of your timber sales go through your building products manufacturing businesses?", "Thomas Gideon", "I would say approximately 55, 60% in general go through.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay, great. And then the puppet's obviously show up in your timber business though you don't book that at cost of building products, I assume.", "Thomas Gideon", "No, all of our logs are transferred at market pricing.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thank you", "Patricia Bedient", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Banc of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Hi everyone and good morning. Few questions here. First of all adding maybe -- on the impairment in the fibers business, obviously, there are some cyclical challenges here, but what changed, and given my words not yours, so radically that there had to been an impairment within the business. Could you give us a bit more color there?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure, was your question on Cellulose Fibers George?", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Yes it was Patty.", "Patricia Bedient", "Okay.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "But can you hear me okay?", "Patricia Bedient", "Yeah. Basically it has to do with the way that the impairment test is done under FAS 142. It is a point in time test. And you're looking at now 12/31 where all of your market caps and market multiples have decreased pretty radically.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Sure.", "Patricia Bedient", "And, we could have a philosophical debate about whether or not those are indicative of the long-term value of the business. But the accounting rules dictate that those are the values that we use so that's one of the big drivers of why those -- that impairment occurred in Cellulose Fibers even though we would look at that business very favorably in terms of it's focus on especially the absorbent markets and the ability of that product line to continue to be attractive. So, really as the function of the downturn that happened at the end of year especially in the markets of that business operate in. And then just globally if you just look at what has happened to market caps generally not only in our industry but others, you are seeing an incredible amount of goodwill impairments in a lot of industries coming out in the fourth quarter and that's primarily for that reason.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for the color on that. I realize this is not the reason why you would do it and it's driven by the accounting rules, but I was curious do the write-downs and impairments of goodwill help you at all ultimately in the process at some point in time to convert to or did it really not get into the various calculations and tests?", "Patricia Bedient", "Yeah, it really doesn't help one way or the other because as you know, those tests are market value tests.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Got you.", "Patricia Bedient", "Has nothing to do with what's on our books.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Patty can you remind us to -- given the sale and now the tax is paid on containerboard, where do you stand in terms of maturities and again if you -- you mentioned at the beginning of the call but what's the cash on hand at the end of quarter?", "Patricia Bedient", "Yeah, the cash on hand at the end of the quarter and cash and short-term investments was about $2.4 billion. Our maturities for 2009 are approximately 450, 460, and then as you look forward into 2010, I believe, our maturities are around 40 million so they drop off pretty dramatically and then in '11 another 30 or $40 million.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Patricia Bedient", "And as I'd mentioned also on the call, we do have available our $2.2 billion of credit lines. Those expire -- we have nothing outstanding under them but those expire, 1.2 billion of them expire in March of 2010 and the remainder 1 billion is at the end of 2011.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Last quick one; I didn't hear necessarily the answer to Rick's -- Rick Skidmore's earlier question in terms of when, Tom, you expect that you'll be cash neutral within wood products? Is that holding current fundamentals going forward? Is that something that is achievable within 2009? Thanks guys.", "Thomas Gideon", "Well that is certainly our goal. I can't give you an exact timeframe. It's a market that's continually been slipping away.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "I understand.", "Thomas Gideon", "We are constantly trying to get in front of that and we're going to accelerate the decisions we need to get us to cash neutral absolutely as quickly as we can. I can't give you a specific timeframe and hope soon we can attain that goal.", "George Staphos - Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Just looking at whether it's 2009 or sometime beyond. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chercover with D.A. Davidson & Co., please go ahead.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Thank you, good morning. First of all, can you give us an update on the status of your two new saw mills in Oregon and Washington?", "Thomas Gideon", "Sure. We have one in Santiam and the other one in Longview; they have started up, they are well along in their start up curve. The -- our goal there is to make sure that the most efficient and cost effective mills are in the west we're well along on where we're expected to be. So good progress.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "So they are both running in presumably the shuts you've taken in this region have been -- it's just cannibalization.", "Thomas Gideon", "I'm making sure that we're moving our volume to our most effective and efficient operations that we can.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Great thanks. And secondly, can you tell us philosophically where you stand on timberland values. It seems like eventually you might be a timber REIT, certainly going through the motions, and some of your existing counterparts are for lack of better words arbitraging the market where they look at private timberland values and realize that they can buyback stock or do things with their own balance sheet by crystallizing some extremely good values right now. How do you feel about that?", "Daniel Fulton", "Steve, this is Dan. I don't want to comment about arbitraging. If your question is what do we think about timberland values, I'll have Tom address that because obviously we're in the market looking all the time, and Tom can you just address what you see in the market for timberland?", "Thomas Gideon", "Well sure Dan. We have seen as we've been in the market on an ongoing basis and what we've seen with some of our recent third parties with Potlatch sale that we basically seen holding up at timberland prices. We haven't seen a significant diminishment or acceleration of prices and so they've been holding fairly steady in the marketplace.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Well I would agree that we haven't seen a decline, so if someone was to offer you what you thought was good value given the current environment, might you crystallize a little bit?", "Daniel Fulton", "Well we are always interested in looking at the best way to create value and add return back to the shareholders and we've got to take that on a case-by-case basis.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Patricia Bedient", "Next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anna Torma with Soleil Securities. Please go ahead.", "Anna Torma - Soleil Securities", "Thank you. Just revisiting Mark Weintraub's question on real estate impairments. Can you give us the sense of what percentage of communities may have been impaired to-date? And what percentage of communities you've impaired more than once at this point?", "Thomas Gideon", "Sure. Anna this is Tom. I think if that -- if you were to look at the land that we'd purchased let's say kind of -- as I said in the run up, post let's say 2002 for our -- kind of in our home building operations we have impaired approximately close to two-thirds of it. And I'd say a good portion of that we have impaired of more than one time. If you look at our kind of entire portfolio when we do have some significant holdings that are prior to 2002, we are probably looking at something on the order of maybe about a third.", "Anna Torma - Soleil Securities", "Great, that helps a lot. And could you talk about some -- the kind of percentage reduction you might be seeing in the number of communities you had in '08. And what reduction you might expect in '09. And do you expect your footprint to change? Are you going to completely exit some markets or enter new markets? Thanks.", "Thomas Gideon", "Sure. We do not anticipate our footprint changing at all. Notwithstanding all of the challenges and the difficulties we like the markets that we're in. We saw about a 25% decline in our number of communities in '08 or excuse me, from '07 to '08. We would anticipate that being probably a little bit less today. And really its going to be a function as we are out there in the communities and we are seeing kind of how the market shapes up if we can be generating cash and being cash positive -- have a good position and able to get some sales and velocity, we will continue to operate those communities if we find conditions change where we're no longer able to do that then we'll revisit that and make a determination to close the community.", "Anna Torma - Soleil Securities", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Patricia Bedient", "Next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Claudia Hueston with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "Hi, thanks very much. I was hoping you could just give an update on your SG&A initiatives, where you are from the timing perspective. And how we should think about those comings through in 2009 and then should we expect a lower corporate expense rate going forward.", "Daniel Fulton", "Claudia, it's Dan. When we announced the initiative in the mid part of last year we had targeted savings at the corporate level of $375 million. And we believe that we could achieve a run-rate of 50% of that by year-end 2008, 90% by the end of 2009. We are ahead of that rate at this point in time. And so I believe that certainly you'll see in the 2009 numbers a good part of that 375 come through our P&L.", "To give you a little flavor, from year-end 2007 to year-end 2008, our total headcount dropped 47%. Now that includes the elimination of our containerboard business both direct employees but also the indirect that supported them. And, at the staff level, which supports all of our businesses over that 12-month period we've seen a decline in headcount of 31%. We've made a lot of change.", "I would suggest that the 375 was a number that we started with in midyear. We are continuing to look for opportunities to find additional savings. So I am confident we'll have hit the 375 but I think you will see more.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thanks. And then maybe could you just comment on the importance, how you feel about sort of your credit rating and the importance of investment grade to you right now at this point?", "Patricia Bedient", "Claudia, this is Patty. I think as we look at our investment grade rating, it has been important to us. And we believe it's important going forward as it relates to our liquidity. So I don't think we have any change in the way that we think about it.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator: Thank you. And at this time there are no further questions.", "Daniel Fulton", "Okay. I'll take a minute to just sum up the call. I'll make a few concluding comments. Going back to December and certainly today you heard us acknowledge that we face some unprecedented challenges as we look at the economy today. The uncertainty of the timing of recovery is what drove actions that we took in December and continue to frame actions that we take in all of our businesses.", "We are moving daily with urgency and decisiveness to adjust to these markets. Adjusting capacity is necessary and even strategy is necessary. We've got disciplined cost control in effect in all of our businesses and support operations. At this point we are focused on action by congress to help stabilize the economy. We believe that they are addressing the need of fixing housing first which would create some stabilization of home prices.", "And following that we need a stabilization of employment and more than anything else is stabilization of consumer sentiment. One of the things that we saw significantly changed in the fourth quarter of the year as it relates to housing which of course affects most of our business activity is the -- what we called is capitulation of the homebuyer. So they went from being concerned about dropping prices to whether or not they had a job. And as every success of announcement comes out regarding employment, you see unemployment increasing; that's a concern, we got to get that fixed.", "Nevertheless we continue to affirm our long-term strategy. Timberlands are our core and we are going to continue to develop the Timberlands asset in all of its aspects. The land, timber, our minerals and energy, our biomass potential, and then the potential that comes from carbon. The markets for all of our products and all of our businesses continue to be supported by some demographics long-term, and so we like the businesses that we are in. And when the recovery begins we will be ready. My takeaway from this morning's call is that you'd like to see some greater disclosure on our Timberlands assets and our Real Estate assets, and we will respond to you and I think you can look for the increased Timberlands exposure -- disclosure in the 10-K and the investor guidance. And thank you very much for your attention this morning.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Weyerhaeuser 2008 fourth quarter earnings conference call.

This is presented on the basis of contribution to earnings before special interests and taxes.", "Changes in Weyerhaeuser\u2019s segment earnings from the first quarter to the second quarter were as follows. Beginning with the first bar on the left hand side of the page, Weyerhaeuser lost $142 million in first quarter 2009. Proceeding from left to right across the waterfall chart, we begin the discussion with Timberland. Timberland earnings were $31 million higher in Q2. This improvement was driven by more non-strategic land sale, lower harvesting cost and higher volume. Lower log prices partially offset this improvement.", "The Wood Products loss improved $29 million in the second quarter. This improvement was driven by lower SG&A, lower manufacturing and lower raw material costs, as well as some model improvement in volume. Cellulose Fibers earnings were $39 million lower in Q2, resulting in a loss for the segment. This was attributable to extended maintenance at two facility and lower prices. Average pulp prices declined $45 from the first quarter.", "The Real Estate loss improved by $26 million in Q2. A favorable mix of business, land and lot sales, lower SG&A, and higher volume drove the improvement. Corporate and other expenses were $34 million lower than in the first quarter. This improvement was primarily attributable to foreign exchange gains and pension and post retirement credit. The final bar to the right of the page is second quarter loss of $61 million before special items. Please note chart one in the information package contains actual Q1 and Q2 contributions to earnings by segment and the total special items, interests, expenses and taxes.", "I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Dan Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy. In our earnings release this morning, I noted that we\u2019ve seen signs of improvement in the housing market, but I also cautioned that it\u2019s too early to declare victory. Despite the encourage headlines about June new home sales and the turnaround in the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, there are indications that the housing market will undergo some minor downturns on its way to recovery. This means that our Timberlands, Wood Products and Real State businesses continued to operate in very uncertain market conditions, as we noted when we announced our dividend action earlier this month.", "Later in this morning\u2019s call Larry Burrows will share the hopeful signs we\u2019ve seen in our real estate markets and some of the items tampering our outlook. As Larry goes through his explanation, it\u2019s important to remember that we have multiple lines of business and the timing of improvement will be differential. When homebuilding starts to improve, it will first benefit our Real Estate business, then Wood Products, and finally Timberlands.", "We welcome the positive signs we saw this week and we know that stronger markets lie ahead. Our future success lies in making lasting changes to our cost structure, work that has our full attention and commitment. Since second quarter last year, we\u2019ve achieved a 34% reduction in SG&A after adjusting for the sale of our Containerboard Packaging business. This equates to approximately $450 million in annual savings.", "As both Tom Gideon and Larry will describe in a moment, we\u2019ve achieved additional savings through operational improvements. These steps address the challenges of the current market and create a more competitive cost structure that will provide significant long-term benefits in more robust market conditions.", "To provide more detail on the state of our current markets and the operational adjustments that we\u2019re making, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our business leaders. We will start this morning with Tom Gideon, who will provide details on our Forest Products segment.", "Tom Gideon", "Thanks, Dan. Second quarter market conditions continued to be challenging. While we saw some indications of market stabilization, the rate of recovery is uncertain. We continue to focus our efforts on reducing costs and improving our performance.", "Starting with Timberlands, referenced on chart five, second quarter earnings were favorably affected by non-strategic land sales and seasonally higher harvest levels. While the continued market slump with downward pressure on both domestic and export realizations, these declines were partially offset by lower operating and SG&A costs. Although harvest levels did increase seasonally, overall harvest levels are down 30% compared with the second quarter of 2008. We expect harvest levels to decline further in the third quarter.", "I should point out that the decline in our harvest levels varies by region. In the West, log prices are depressed because of the collapse of the California housing market. We\u2019ve reduced harvest levels by 35% compared with second quarter last year while we neared completion of the final (inaudible) of stands damaged by the December 2007 storm. We also had higher export log sales during the quarter due to our close ties with Asian customers and our determined marketing efforts. Our key Japanese customers improved their market share despite lower post and beam housing starts.", "In addition, we have seen renewed demand for domestic quality Douglas-fir in China. We have leveraged this opportunity to sell these logs at margins higher than we would have received from domestic customers. This is a prime example of the work we do to maximize the value from our logs.", "In the South, harvest volumes were 23% lower when compared to second quarter of 2008. Most of this long reduction is in grade logs and we anticipate additional grade log deferrals in the third quarter. We are continuing our early thinning [ph] program to improve stand values and servicing fiber log customers.", "Moving to Wood Products, please refer to charts six and seven. We continue to adjust the levers that we can influence; balancing our production against demand, controlling our costs, maintaining our pricing discipline, and taking appropriate actions to improve our cash performance. Today, we are running about half of the facilities that we were at peak market conditions and have reduced staffing by a comparable amount over the same timeframe.", "I should point out that more than 1,900 of those positions were eliminated this year alone. In the process, we are also making some fundamental changes to how we operate Wood Products that we will carry in the stronger markets. This includes lowering product inventories by $68 million in the second quarter alone as we have effectively balanced production against demand and applied lean manufacturing principles to lower inventory levels in our replenishment system.", "While we are still not satisfied with our results, we are making progress even in due of revenues being down 46% and lumber realizations off by $58 a 1,000 compared to second quarter of last year. We continue to rescale our business and reduced all of our costs. Earlier this month, we announced the permanent closure of our Taylor, Louisiana sawmill, our 16th sawmill closure since 2006. Given our losses in lumber, we will take significant further curtailments across our lumber system in the third quarter. We also initiated further staffing reductions in mid-June, which will eliminate another 300 positions by the end of the quarter.", "Turning now to Cellulose Fibers on chart eight, second quarter earnings were negatively affected by an extensive boiler repair at a Columbus, Mississippi operation and annual maintenance outages at two other facilities. Realizations declined by $45 per ton, but were partially offset through improved freight, fiber, energy, and chemical costs. The business has continued to improve its competitiveness by aggressively reducing input, manufacturing, maintenance and SG&A costs. This focus on cost reduction and operating excellence positions the business to capture optimum value when the markets rebound.", "I would also like to mention that once again we led the industry in safety during the past quarter. This is a real tribute to the caring and commitment of our employees during these challenging times, and we continue to see improved safety translate into improved operating performance.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Burrows.", "Larry Burrows", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning. Housing margin conditions improved across all WRECO geographies during the second quarter. Record affordability, low interest rates, and\u00a0modestly improved consumer confidence, combined with federal and California tax credits induced home buyers\u00a0to enter the market. WRECO\u2019s Arizona and California markets demonstrated the greatest improvement during the second quarter, as they experienced increased traffic at greater number of home sales and lower cancellation rates relative to the first quarter.", "The Puget Sound and Washington DC markets also strengthened. Modest market gains occurred in Houston and Las Vegas. These trends are reflected in the key indicators table on chart nine. Comparing the second quarter of 2009 to 2008, home sales increased 6% and our cancellation rate declined significantly. However, other metrics remained well below 2008 levels. Traffic decreased 33% compared to the second quarter of 2008 and closings fell by 47%.", "WRECO\u2019s financial results reflect the slightly enhanced market conditions. We recorded $50 million pretax loss in the second quarter, including $52 million in one-time charges. These charges include $2 million for restructuring, $11 million from terminating options on land in the states of Maryland and Washington, $5 million of impairing investments, and $34 million from impairments in virtually all of our markets.", "We also realized gains of $16 million from the sale of land, lots, and partnership interests located in California, Nevada and Pacific Northwest. Excluding the gains on land and partnership sales and the one-time charges, WRECO lost $14 million on second quarter operations. I have previously discussed WRECO\u2019s strategy to sell approximately 4,000 lots, principally in Arizona, California and Nevada. We closed approximately 20% of these lots during the second quarter and are in active negotiations on the remaining properties. Though we are somewhat encouraged by signs of potential recovery, the housing markets still face significant headwinds in the third quarter.", "Consumer confidence remains fragile. It improved through much of the second quarter only to decline in June and July. Unemployment continues to rise. Though the pace of foreclosures had slowed, the availability of foreclosed homes continues to place downward pressure on new home prices. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s May 1st implementation of new appraisal standard creates a potential disconnect between a home\u2019s contracted sales prices and its appraised value.", "Earlier this month, the State of California exhausted its available tax credit funding. Though the federal credit is available through December 1st, potential buyers of a to-be-built home must purchase soon to ensure they can settle before the credit expires. The combination of these factors threatens to delay the housing market recovery.", "WRECO expects to incur a greater loss from home-building operations in the third quarter compared to the second. While we anticipate a comparable number of home closings in the third quarter, our mix will temporarily shift away from higher priced California homes in favor of lower priced Arizona properties. In the second quarter, Pardee [ph] Homes successfully sold and closed on much of its available California inventory before building\u00a0its backlog with sales that we expect to close late this year.", "In contrast, (inaudible) homes, which had little standing inventory in Arizona, sold primarily to-be-built homes during the second quarter. These sales will be reflected in third quarter closes. We continued to adjust staffing, reduce the quantity of model homes and pair down [ph] unsold inventory. We have cut land spending to a bare minimum.", "As Dan said, we believe that stronger markets lie ahead. However, numerous obstacles lie between current housing market conditions and a full sustainable recovery. The actions we continue to execute are enabling WRECO to generate cash today and returning to profitability as our markets stabilize.", "I will now turn the call over to Patty to discuss the outlook for the third quarter.", "Patty Bedient", "Thanks, Larry, and good morning. While we believe that markets are stabilizing, we don\u2019t expect a significant improvement in economic conditions in the third quarter. Our focus will continue to concentrate on cost control and disciplined matching of supply with demand.", "I\u2019ll begin the outlook with Timberland. As Tom has already described, we expect to be deferring additional fee timber harvest as a result of weak prices for logs. This is especially true in the south where realizations for grade logs are expected to soften. Export price realizations in the west are also likely to weaken somewhat. We anticipate the per-unit costs will be slightly higher due to lower volume. Excluding the impact of non-strategic land sales, we expect that Timberland earnings in the third quarter will be lower than the second quarter.", "In Wood Products, we believe that low demand levels will persist. While we may see some slight price improvements in selected products, we do not believe that it will result in significant earnings improvement. We continued to take additional downtime in order to balance our supply with demand. Tom has already given you an overview of some of the additional actions we are taking in the third quarter, especially in our lumber system. Our increased focus on working capital and cost control should result in lower losses in the third quarter compared to the second.", "In Cellulose Fibers, we expect pulp prices to stabilize in the third quarter. Pulp production is expected to increase due to less maintenance downtime. This increased production and lower maintenance spending and input costs should result in improved earnings. We expect to blend slightly more alternative fuel in the third quarter compared to the second. Overall, we expect earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment to increase in the third quarter compared to the second.", "Larry has already shared the third quarter outlook for our Real Estate business where we anticipate the loss in our single-family homebuilding business to increase compared to the second quarter, primarily as a result of lower average closing prices driven mostly by a change in mix.", "Now I\u2019ll close my remarks with some selected financial comments. Our cash flow from operations improved significantly during the quarter, primarily as a result of improved operating results, receipts from alternative fuel tax credits and working capital reductions. Our capital spending for the quarter, including\u00a0reforestation, was approximately $40 million for a total of $107 million year-to-date. We anticipate capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $200 million.", "At the end of the quarter, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.2 billion lines of credit, and we are in compliance with all debt covenants. We have debt maturities of approximately $400 million in the quarter and we will be making our semi-annual interest payments of approximately $150 million.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.", "Dan Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. This quarter was one of continued challenges for three of our businesses and strong operational performance for the fourth. Our Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate businesses are all feeling the effects of the weak housing market. In response, our Timberlands business is deferring harvest, while Wood Products continues to adjust its operations to match supply with demand.", "Real Estate saw some improvement across the board, but expects to experience continued pressure on margins. Cellulose Fibers is our bright spot, as this business is generating cash from both operations and from the alternative energy tax credit. As you\u2019ve heard from several others this morning, we\u2019ve made significant improvements in our cost structure, but we know more can be done and we continue our focus on identifying opportunities to further reductions.", "And now we\u2019ll open the call up to questions.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Sharnay, we\u2019re ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) Our first question is George Staphos with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Hi, everyone, good morning to you. I guess the first question I had within Wood Products is, if you think about the next two to three quarters and eliminate the impact of seasonality and whatever trend we may see in the market per se, what kind of incremental benefit do you think is possible to be seen from your own efforts within the business from an earnings power standpoint, not necessarily next quarter, but say over the next two or three quarters?", "Tom Gideon", "Well, George, we have seen sustained progress as we rescaled our business over the course of the last six months. And we did see significantly improved earnings from operation as well as cash usage throughout the second quarter. And in fact, I would note that for the month of June, we were still slightly negative from an earnings point of view, but with working capital reductions, we were cash positive. Now, we are the first to admit that one month is not a trend mate and that there is a lot of uncertainties still going forward. But July at this point looks similar to June, and we expect that we\u2019re going to continue to move forward across all the actions that we\u2019ve taken and what we need to do additional as market conditions warrant.", "We are not waiting as others have mentioned for market conditions to improve or counting on that improvement, so we are going to adjust all of the levers that we have available to us to make this improvement occur. As we all know, sustainability at this level is going to be a function of what price is, what we do with respect to demand and volume, and of course, what we can do to continue to reduce our costs. So we continue to do the levers that we have, including deferring harvest, including further curtailments on our operations. We announced the closure of our Taylor, Louisiana sawmill, and of course we\u2019ve taken additional staffing reductions, as I mentioned in the remarks, of about another 300 individuals throughout our organization. So our focus is going to remain on improving our cash usage, and we believe (inaudible) going to be on the basis of continued low levels of demand.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Appreciate the comments, Tom. Maybe two quick questions to finish up -- first of all, how much were boiler and repair outages and impact of those things in the second quarter within Cellulose Fibers?", "Tom Gideon", "Say, George, could you kind of repeat the question for me?", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Yes, sorry about that. How much was the overall effect from boiler repair and outages in the second quarter?", "Tom Gideon", "Okay. Are you talking about in terms of expense or --?", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Yes, exactly.", "Tom Gideon", "Okay. Well, the expense for the Columbus boiler repair was approximately $30 million of maintenance expense spread out over a 45-day outage.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And I guess the last quick one, just out of curiosity, that box plant that you had not sold to IT that went to somebody else, which facility was that?", "Tom Gideon", "George, that was our facility in Honolulu, Hawaii, one that we had taken out early in the process of the transaction with International Paper.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Seemed like it was a good price you got for it. Anyway, I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Patty Bedient", "George, just one thing on the 45 days that Tom was mentioning on Columbus, we had 30 of that in the second quarter and 15 of it will be in the third.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Patty.", "Patty Bedient", "Yes.", "Tom Gideon", "Thank you, George.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Thank you. Two questions. First, Tom, you talked about activities that go beyond right-sizing, and you mentioned working capital. Can you give us a sense of those activities that are going to make the business look different when the volumes come back? Most of what you mentioned just sounds like it\u2019s right-sizing. I\u2019m just curious, is there much going on beyond that to try to shift what this thing is going to look like when the recovery is here?", "Tom Gideon", "Sure, Mark. One of the activities that we are doing across our entire organization, and in fact, we are applying against all elements of our business system is applying the concept of lean manufacturing to sustainably and predictably improve our performance. That involves looking across our supply chain, removing inventory buffers on a permanent basis, taking up waste wherever we can across our system and improving our operational reliability. And we apply that both to our operating facilities as well as to our business systems. So we believe we\u2019ve made some fundamental sustained improvements on our business system going forward.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "And that will take your working capital down then on a sustainable basis as well?", "Tom Gideon", "Yes, we\u2019ll take it down, but we should recognize that as markets improve and working capital goes up, we will be able to maintain it at a lower level than it would have been had we not under the actions [ph].", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Great, perfect. Okay. And a question for Dan, big picture question, when you think about your portfolio and obviously this is a tough time in a lot of businesses, when you think strategically, do you think that Weyerhaeuser needs to rethink its product diversification? When we look at the old portfolio, maybe some of the businesses weren\u2019t great, but it was far more diversified than what you have now. And that was -- those were decisions made over decades that have been pretty much reversed in the last two or three years. I\u2019m curious how you are thinking about dealing with diversification as we get past this cycle.", "Dan Fulton", "Good question, Mark. I mean, clearly as we exited the Fine Paper business and we exited the Containerboard Packaging business, we are more reliant on US housing market. And as we look forward, the Cellulose Fibers business gives us diversification away from the housing market and also puts us on a global market situation where we compete all over the world. So that\u2019s a positive for us. As we look at our Timberlands, we have opportunities in our Timberlands business to diversify earning streams in the future that will come from what we would call the bio-products and biochemical opportunities that emerge from our land.", "We\u2019ve talked about that in some of our sessions such as in May so that -- I think, as we look at the Timberlands, we\u2019ve got an energy potential in the future and a bio-products potential in the future. We also have potential to expand beyond our borders in our position in South America. We\u2019ve got a small position in Timberlands in China. And so our focus would be to continue to build our Timberlands capabilities and opportunities, and I think that\u2019s where we are going to find the diversification opportunities that will lessen reliance on the housing cycles in the US.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Very helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Hi. Actually, maybe just taking the opposite side of that equation when you look at the portfolio and you start seeing markets recover and you may have some more opportunity to sell, do you think you might consider further restructuring beyond what you\u2019ve done?", "Dan Fulton", "Gail, we continue to evaluate the performance of the portfolio on an ongoing basis, as we\u2019ve shared before. Our foundational business is our Timberlands, which includes the land, the timber, the minerals, and oil and gas rights that come with that, as well as what I mentioned in the conversation with Mark, biomass and energy potential. Our other businesses, the challenge that we have for them is that they operate on top quartile basis. We have significant scale in our Wood Products business, and we believe that that has significant earnings power and cash flow generation potential for us, as the housing market recovers.", "Our Real Estate business has been a top quartile performer in the past, and as we come out of this cycle, our focus will be getting back to performance at that prior level. And our Cellulose Fibers business, as you know, is focused on high-value absorbance. But the goal for each of those is that they would be able to perform at peak levels in top quartile as compared to peers, that they would be able to generate cash for the portfolio as well as for their own internal needs, and we have the ability on an ongoing basis to measure their effectiveness internally in the valued Weyerhaeuser company as compared to alternatives. So I think the message from me would be that we continue to evaluate the portfolio. We like the businesses that we have today, but our goal is for them to be top performing.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And a couple of questions for Patty. Patty, how much cash did you actually receive from the fuel credits in the quarter? And can you also give an update on the status of your loans to the pension plan? I thought that maybe they were kind of callable at six months or something like that when they can.", "Patty Bedient", "Yes. In terms of the alternative fuel tax credits, we received actual cash receipts in the quarter of right around $80 million and the bulk of the remainder in the -- right after the end of the quarter, so in this month. In terms of the loans to the pension plan, there was no activity on those loans. We did extend the payment terms on some of them for another six months. I would expect that we would see some of that cash coming back late in the year, but probably the bulk of it after the first of the year.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And Dan or Patty, I don\u2019t know if either one of you want to comment on the decision to cut the dividend again, especially in light of the improved cash flow in the second quarter.", "Dan Fulton", "I\u2019ll comment, Gail. The decision was made by the Board, as we said when we announced it, to enhance liquidity and provide financial flexibility in light of what we continue to believe is an uncertain market. So the point we are making this morning, we are pleased with the activity in the second quarter. As Larry talked about, we saw a turnaround in housing. We started to see some improvement in Wood Products, but we are not convinced that it is sustainable at this point. And we think that we will have significant uncertainty during this recovery until we see unemployment peak and start to come down, and consumer confidence be restored and we still have significant issues on dealing with the foreclosed housing inventory that exists.", "And as Larry pointed out, interestingly, the boost that we got from the tax credit programs, both federal and state, can provide some disruption in the marketplace. So we benefited from it, but when those tax credits go away as they have in California, then there is an adjustment. So the decision of the Board was focused on -- we continue to believe there is a significant amount of uncertainty in the direction of recovery and then couple that with the desire to have greater flexibility and liquidity as we move forward.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. I had some questions around the timberland. Is it possible to get a sense of how much the gain was in the quarter on that -- the non-strategic land sales and also where those sales occurred at?", "Dan Fulton", "Sure, Mark. As you know, we have an ongoing land adjustment program. So we had a number of parcels that we are looking at to see if there is an opportunity to exchange or sell. We had some non-strategic timberland sales this quarter. The bulk of that was focused in a comfortable region in Southwest of Washington and it was for about 14,000 acres.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And the gain on that?", "Dan Fulton", "Tom?", "Tom Gideon", "Overall what we had, we saw the sales price for that was about $34 million for the 14,000 or approximately $2,500 an acre. This was property that was very heavily oriented towards Hemlock Stands as opposed to Douglas fir. It was an area that had not only seen some salvage activity as a result of the December 7th storms, which still has some residual impact that they are still resident in the stands themselves. And it\u2019s also one that, as an entity, is significantly young in its age class. It only averages 24 years, so significantly high percentage of pre-merges on that particular set of property. So when we look at everything and put all of that in to consideration, we thought\u00a0it was overall good valuations for us, Mark.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Couple of other questions, Tom, on the timberland. I noticed just digging back in the details that your outside sales of southern timber were up about 2.5-fold year-on-year, but when I look at the depletion in terms of kind of cubic meters in the south, it was down sharply. Can you help us explain -- help us understand what\u2019s going on there?", "Tom Gideon", "Well, in some respect, that\u2019s the fact that we have looked at outside sales as we\u2019ve reduced the usage internally, and it\u2019s just the balancing of that against our usage against what\u2019s available in the marketplace.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then in your commentary, you kind of leave open in timberland a question of additional non-strategic sales in the second half. Can you provide us with any thoughts on what we might see there?", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, Mark, this is Patty. As I made the comment about excluding the non-strategic timber sales, as you know, we have an ongoing program of improving our portfolio through timberland sales and its changes. And just to give you some color on that, I just -- in terms of giving you the guidance for the third quarter, I have excluded those. They are lumpy, so it just depends upon what we find in terms of good value where we look at potential to improve that portfolio. So we really -- I think Tom has already taken you through the changes in the second quarter and we really aren\u2019t forecasting what level that might be in the quarter.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Well, I guess to come right to the point, I mean, there were reports about six months ago about you guys having a lot of land for sale potentially in the Pacific Northwest. I think many of us have written about that. Aside from this sale of 14,000 acres, we really haven\u2019t seen much. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of whether we should assume much in a way of land sales as we look into the second half.", "Tom Gideon", "Again, Mark, we just don\u2019t comment or speculate on rumors that are out the marketplace regarding the potential land sales. One thing that I would like to go back and reiterate was when you were talking about the third-party sales, you might have been referring it back far enough that when we sold CBPR, a lot of the internal sales of fiber logs have been transferred into third-party sales as a result of them going to International Paper.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And finally, just a question on Wood Products. Volumes are off sharply. We\u2019re all uncertain about when the housing market is going to recover. Would you consider in your Wood Products business things like perhaps creating some joint ventures that might help to rationalize things on the supply side, say, in the engineered wood type business?", "Tom Gideon", "Mark, again, we are focused first and foremost on improving what we have and what we have -- what we need to do in order to make the sustained improvements that need to happen. But again, as Dan has mentioned, we will consider any opportunity that could potentially add value and would be accretive to the return to our shareholders.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, very good. Thanks very much.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Next question. Operator?", "Operator", "I\u2019m sorry. The next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, good morning. First question is on the homebuilding unit, and I was just curious, do you have -- you used to tell us or you do tell us that your rough -- your tax basis for the timberland is around $1 billion. What would be the similar number at this point for the homebuilder?", "Patty Bedient", "I think what we\u2019ve said, Chip, as it relates to Timberlands is that our tax basis is less than $1 billion. So it is well under what our book basis and fair market value basis is. In WRECO, in our Real Estate business, our tax basis exceed our book basis, primarily as a result of the impairments that we\u2019ve taken because we can\u2019t take those for tax purposes until we actually dispose off the land. So it would be greater than book value.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And could that be by as much as -- looking at all the impairments and I can\u2019t add them up right now, but it would look like there could be as much as $1 billion gap in the other direction there.", "Larry Burrows", "Chip, this is Larry. I think when we chatted in New York a couple of months ago, we said that I think we had a book value -- and this is going back to the first quarter of about $1.6 billion and there was about a little less than $1 billion -- in addition, there was about $1 billion of impairments that we have on top of that.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got you, okay. So 2.5 for tax purposes at this point [ph]. And I guess, Larry, you are mentioning the lot sales, and just to make sure I got that right that there are about 4,000 lots you\u2019re actively marketing in California, Nevada and Arizona, and you got about 20% of them sold. I\u2019m kind of guessing here, but did you -- are you getting, what, roughly -- I mean, it\u2019s like 10,000 a lot sort of where prices are moving right now?", "Larry Burrows", "It really varies greatly because of not only the location but kind of the condition of the loss. So something in Arizona would be different maybe than something in Vegas versus Southern California. And also -- are they -- all of them are entitled, some of them have some land spend that\u2019s already been part of it, but some of them don\u2019t. And so it varies. And so something that\u2019s entitled, then in the raw, you get -- it would be a little bit lower price if something is entitled, but also has some land development spending that\u2019s been associated with it.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got you. And last question is, Dan, at the top of the call, you said that when we see housing recovery, you expected the WRECO to benefit first and then Wood Products and then Timberlands. I\u2019m just kind of curious. I always thought there was a bit of lag in terms of the ability to get pricing up on the houses. Obviously, the units would improve, but is there a chance that maybe next year we would see Wood Products lead the way only because there could be a better chance that repair and remodeling could lead the way?", "Dan Fulton", "My take on the sequential recovery is that we\u2019ve had disappearance of the significant number of participants in the homebuilding business, the private builders. And as the recovery begins, the larger, well-capitalized public builders should have the capacity to take advantage of that first, because they have got a land position and lots to build on. And they don\u2019t need a construction loan from a bank. And so our experience is we\u2019ll start to see that uptick earlier, and then we\u2019ll translate into home -- into Wood Products. In Wood Products, there is a bit of a lag and there is more of an overcapacity issue in the Wood Products arena. And then Wood Products producers, as their activity starts to pick up, they need to earn a margin on manufacturing and that ultimately then translate in the log values. And it\u2019s going to be differential by market and it\u2019s going to be very regional, but it\u2019s a general comment.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got you. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you. Just following up on the timing of things getting better and perhaps also things getting worse. Do you think that the Timberlands business, which as you noted tends to be lagged, has seen the full brunt of the effect of the downturn, or do you expect that there will still be more downward pressure, particularly on private market values for timberland?", "Tom Gideon", "Markets we look at in terms of just the log usage and takeaway as well as pricing, I think Timberlands is reflecting what the markets have to offer in Wood Products and up through housing today. Again, what happens there will mirror what the recovery that we see throughout those components of our portfolio.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. But so -- as long as things don\u2019t get worse in housing, you think that Timberlands essentially have bottomed though? Is that a fair characterization of what\u00a0you just said?", "Tom Gideon", "I would say -- I was trying to say that this is going to mirror that and we still believe there is some uncertainty going forward, and we are not able to pinpoint with the high degree of accuracy on where we are at in the system, but it does appear that we\u2019ve seen some relative stabilization across demand going all the way from housing and through Wood Products and then eventually down through to Timberlands.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. I\u2019m sorry, I may have missed it, but what did you say the gain on the FIA sale had been?", "Tom Gideon", "I didn\u2019t mention what the gain was. I mentioned that the total sale price for that sale was approximately $34 million.", "Patty Bedient", "And the gain, Mark, was just under $30 million.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks, and good morning. Couple questions. Is it possible, Tom, to share with us the amount of gains that you may have had in the first quarter and also in the year-ago quarter? I think they were much lower?", "Tom Gideon", "Peter, could you help me out a little bit more about what specific gains you\u2019re referring to?", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I\u2019m sorry. The non-strategic land sales gains in the timber business.", "Tom Gideon", "Okay. And you are asking what we are year-over-year?", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Well, in other words, you shared with us what the gain was in the second quarter. I\u2019m curious to be able to have an apples-to-apples comparison. I'm curious on how much gain you may have had embedded in your reported numbers in the first quarter and in the year-ago quarter for Timberlands.", "Tom Gideon", "I was hoping that -- I just don\u2019t have -- really available to me, but something that I think Patty can get back to you.", "Patty Bedient", "I\u2019ll get back to you, Pete, on that.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And I\u2019d also be curious, Tom, to the extent you can comment on your harvests in terms of what you would characterize a saw timber versus pulpwood and has that shifted much over the last year or so.", "Tom Gideon", "Well, certainly over the last six months, we\u2019ve started to see some reduction in our pine grade as compared to our fiber in the south [ph]. And we expect that that\u2019s going to continue, Peter, as we take off our harvest deferrals up a little bit going forward in the third quarter.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And Tom, also you mentioned your -- some of your commentary on log exposure to Japan, I\u2019m curious if you could comment on the demand and pricing trend you\u2019re seeing for logs and lumber outside of Japan and other Asian markets, whether it be China, Korea or elsewhere.", "Tom Gideon", "Peter, as I mentioned, we are starting to see some renewed demand in China for a domestic log that previously wasn\u2019t something that the export market was looking for. So we\u2019re exploring that. It\u2019s had good margins compared to our domestic alternative, and we think that that can move into a very fruitful market for us as things progress.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Just lastly if I could, maybe a question for Dan -- I'm curious, Dan, on what you\u2019d be willing to share your thoughts on the timber deed structure announced recently, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve looked at every structure under the sun, but can you share any thoughts on whether that might be something applicable for Weyerhaeuser?", "Dan Fulton", "I\u2019m not able to comment on that today, Peter.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes. Just a couple of cleanups. One, it looked like the tax rate came down quite a bit quarter-to-quarter. Can you comment on that, Patty?", "Patty Bedient", "You got it, Mark. As you think about our tax rate, in the first quarter, our tax rate for the year, we were looking at about 38%. As we look at it now at the end of the second quarter, our effective tax rate is around 36%. So you had about 2% or somewhere around $10 million of cumulative rate cleanup for the quarter -- or for the year-to-date that runs to the second quarter. And then we had about $13 million, just over $10 million of discrete items in the quarter for some state tax, deferred taxes, as well as some FIN 48 charges. It\u2019s about -- going forward the tax rate for the year, as we sit here today, we\u2019re looking at just under 36%.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And I also noticed -- it looked like SG&A came down sequentially about $24 million. Is that level we saw in the second quarter, is that a new sustainable level?", "Dan Fulton", "Mark, I think what you\u2019re going to see is continued decline in SG&A. As I mentioned in my remarks, on a year-over-year basis, our SG&A is down $450 million at a run rate level. And we are continuing to take out costs, and so you should expect to see that number to continue to decline.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Very good, Dan. Good luck in the third quarter.", "Dan Fulton", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn it back to management for any closing remarks.", "Dan Fulton", "Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. Just a couple of wrap-up comments. I want to emphasize that we are doing business in a changing environment with varying degrees of uncertainty related to the economic situation, consumer confidence, and in addition, the political environment. Our current focus continues to be to respond to market opportunities while maintaining a focus on driving cost down for long-term sustainable benefit. And we believe that our portfolio of the building blocks that we have in our portfolio and their relationship to the new energy and climate change policies that are being developed offer us new opportunities for our biomass, and we believe we will see benefits from our longstanding practices of sustainable forestry. And finally, our strategic view is the portfolio of assets that we have are well positioned to take advantage of that changing environment. I appreciate your attention today. As always, follow-up questions can be directed to Kathy. Kathy, any final comments?", "Kathryn McAuley", "No, I don\u2019t believe so, but I\u2019ll be back in my office shortly and I\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions.", "Dan Fulton", "Thank you very much.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Weyerhaeuser second quarter 2009 earnings conference call.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser\u2019s fourth quarter earnings release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remark there will be a question-and-answer period.", "(Operator instructions) I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy McAuley. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.", "Kathy McAuley", "Thank you, Tia. Good morning. Welcome to Weyerhaeuser\u2019s fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I am Kathy McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer, Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Gideon, Executive Vice President, Forest Products; and Larry Burrows, President, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.", "This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release and material for this call can be found at the website or by contacting April Meier at 253-924-2937.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported a fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $1.75 million or $0.83 per share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.5 billion. For the full year 2009, Weyerhaeuser reported a net loss of $545 million or $2.58 per share, on net sales from continuing operations of $5.5 billion.", "Significant after-tax items in the fourth quarter were a benefit of $77 million or $0.36 per share for alternative fuel mixture credit, a charge of $67 million or $0.31 per share for real estate asset impairment, closures, restructuring and other charges. Our charge is $57 million or $0.27 per share for forest product asset impairment, closures, restructuring and other charges. Our charge is $19 million or $0.09 per share for the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items the company reported a net loss of $109 million or $0.52 per share.", "A GAAP reconciliation of special items is available on our website in the earnings information package. Please turn to chart four in the earnings information package, as I will discuss this waterfall chart. Chart four is a bar chart detailing the changes in contribution to earnings before special items, interest and taxes.", "Changes in Weyerhaeuser\u2019s segment earnings from the third quarter to the fourth quarter were as follows", "Beginning with the first bar on the left-hand side of the page, in the third quarter of 2009, Weyerhaeuser earned $15 million before special items, interest and taxes. Proceeding from left to right across the waterfall chart, we will begin a discussion with Timberlands.", "Timberlands\u2019 earnings were $30 million lower in Q4. This decline was driven by significantly lower harvest volumes and fewer sales of non-strategic timberland. Higher logging costs more than offset improvement in pricing mix. Wood products earnings were $31 million lower in fourth quarter; significantly lower production due to weak seasonal market demand resulted in higher per unit manufacturing cost. Average lumber prices declined 3% from the third quarter average. OSB prices were 6% lower and engineered wood products prices were flat.", "Cellulose fibers earnings were $10 million lower in Q4, an 8% increase in average pulp prices was more than offset by higher fiber maintenance and energy cost.", "Real estate earnings were $20 million higher than in the previous quarter. This improvement was driven by higher margins and a 54% increase in closing. Corporate and other expenses increased by $25 million, due primarily to foreign exchange and lease adjustments for transportation assets. The final bar to the right of the page is the fourth quarter loss of $61 million before special items, interests and taxes.", "Please note chart one, in the information package detailed, the Q3 and Q4 pre-tax contributions to earnings by segment before significant items as well as consolidated results. And now I'll turn the call over to Dan Fulton.", "Dan Fulton", "Thank you Kathy, and good morning. In our earnings release this morning, I voice confidence in our ability to deliver significantly improved operating performance despite the unacceptable 2009 financial results and continued challenges as we enter 2010.", "I\u2019d like to spend my portion of today's call providing more detail and color to the items I outlined in my statement, because it will help set the stage for the comments from our team that\u2019s following.", "Although I'll discuss each point individually, you should think of them as interconnected and encompassing our strategic approach to meeting the current challenges while positioning us to rebuild our revenues and earnings.", "Just to remind everyone, the areas of focus I outlined in this morning's release involved cutting costs, reducing production to meet demand, generating cash, deferring our harvest, improving long-term competitiveness across all business lines, growing with strategic customers and announcing our decision to convert to a real estate investment trust.", "I started my comment in the release by noting that we had cut costs, and that\u2019s a good place to open my discussion on this call. As we said repeatedly, we must reduce our SG&A costs to make us more competitive, and by the end of 2009 we\u2019d cut those costs by nearly $300 million. Our overall head count is down 26% because of the SG&A changes as well as reductions in operations.", "We made significant cuts in other expenses as well. This included redesigning our compensation and our benefits package for both active and retired employees. Each of our businesses has also aggressively reduced costs. With products, for example, was making fundamental changes that will carry into stronger markets. This includes lowering product inventories by applying well known lean manufacturing principles to lower inventory levels in our replenishment system.", "Closely coupled with the need to reduced costs is our strong focus on generating cash and maintaining liquidity. We ended the year with $1.9 billion in cash and strong liquidity. With a whole building and remodel markets of record growths [ph] demand for our products has dropped significantly.", "As I mentioned in our earnings release, we responded by deferring our harvest to preserve the long-term value of our timberlands and we\u2019ve reduced production to meet demand. In some cases this involves changes to our operating posture such as eliminating shifts. In other cases we have used this opportunity to eliminate non-competitive males from our system to create a more efficient system that enhances our ability to capture the benefits to stronger market conditions.", "While meeting current market challenges is the keen focus we continue to invest in growing our businesses. When I mentioned growing with strategic customers in my comment this morning, one example of that was our announced plans to build a new cellulose fibers processing plant in Gdansk, Poland. But there are other opportunities as well. The world is demanding green solutions for energy and we have significant opportunities with our biomass initiatives.", "On Tuesday, we announced that we are collaborating with Mitsubishi Corporation to explore the possibilities of a strategic solid biofuel venture. Catchlight Energy are joint venture with Chevron to develop liquid fuel from biomass remains on track.", "Finally, I want to touch on our decision to convert to a real estate investment trust, the final item that I mentioned this morning. As we said in December when we announced our intent to elect REIT status, this represents a positive step in executing our overall strategic direction. The REIT structure best supports Weyerhaeuser's commitment to maximize our timberland returns by allowing us to become a more tax efficient and competitive owner, manager and buyer of timberlands.", "As I said in my statements this morning, we faced challenging markets as we enter 2010 because of the actions we have taken over the past year, and we\u2019ll continue to take, I am confident we will deliver significantly improved operating performance. I\u2019d like now to turn the call over to Tom Gideon, who will discuss the fourth quarter performance for timberlands, wood products and cellulose fibers.", "Tom Gideon", "Thank you, Dan. Our forest products businesses experienced a difficult fourth quarter, as the effect of the traditional seasonal downtime churn further compounded the challengers created by a weak housing market. I will start by discussing our timberlands business referenced on chart five.", "Timberlands revenues declined in the fourth quarter compared to the third as moderate improvements on Western Log realizations were offset by a significant decrease in sales volumes in both the west and the south. Harvest levels declined 21% versus the third quarter as we elected to defer additional volume to preserve value. Harvest levels in our southern operations were also reduced due to weather. Export realizations were unchanged from the third quarter while our volumes were down modestly.", "On the costs side, per unit logging and trucking cost increased as a result of lower harvest volumes and higher diesel prices. Minerals revenue declined in the fourth quarter compared to the third as third quarter included a one-time sale of mineral royalties. Our strongest minerals activity remains concentrated in the Haynesville Shale region. We had no significant sales of non-strategic lands in the fourth quarter.", "Fourth quarter included $15 million of impairment charges primarily associated with our joint venture sawmill in Brazil. Excluding those one-time charges the segment earned $28 million on fourth quarter operations. Harvest deferrals had a significant effect on our timberland segment in 2009, as our US harvest volumes declined 33% compared to 2008. We strongly believe that these deferrals remain an important way to preserve value for our shareholders and we will continue to defer harvest in 2010.", "I will now turn to wood products referenced in chart six and seven. Revenue for the segment declined 13% in the fourth quarter compared to the third as the normal seasonal slowdown plays downward pressure on sales volumes and realizations. Volumes declined across all product lines with engineered wood products down approximately 20% quarter-over-quarter and softwood lumber up 5%.", "Realizations for engineered lumber held up well throughout the quarter. Average quarterly realizations from most other products declined compared to the third quarter, though realizations did climb as the fourth quarter progressed.", "Ongoing efforts to balance production against demand resulted in 79 weeks of down time across our lumber system in the quarter representing 29% of available operating hours. We also increased downtime across most of our own lumber facilities. Although we have continue to reduce overall cost of production, unit manufacturing cost rose in the fourth quarter compared to third due to low production volume. This was particularly true for our softwood lumber facilities.", "Fourth quarter earnings for the wood product segment included $85 million in one-time charge, primarily for impairments and our engineered wood products and softwood lumber segments. Excluding those one-time charges, wood products lost $123 million on fourth quarter operations. These are unacceptable results, even though we have dramatically improved our costs structure from where it was a year ago.", "Comparing the full year 2009 to 2008 per unit manufacturing costs for softwood lumber have declined year-over-year despite a 29% drop in sales volume. We have held unit manufacturing costs for OSP flat in the phase of a 40% volume decline. SG&A expense has decreased by $103 million or 25%.", "Total wood products headcount has declined by 29% or nearly 3,100 positions versus this time a year ago. Though encouraging, these improvements are not sufficient unless we double our efforts to reduce expenses and increase margins throughout our operating system.", "Moving into 2010, we will continue to match supply with demand, improving operating efficiencies and totally scrutinize every use of cash. Finally, I will discuss our cellulose fibers business referenced on chart eight. Cellulose fibers revenues increased 4% in the fourth quarter compared to the third as average price realizations improved by $53 per ton. However, this additional revenue was more than offset by increased cost of production. Fiber cost increased substantially rising by $20 per ton in the fourth quarter as adverse weather in the US south [ph] reduced availability of both logs and solve my residuals.", "Energy costs also improved. Our New Bern, North Carolina mill completed and extended scheduled outage in the fourth quarter to perform annual maintenance and complete a capital project to rebuild the mills recovery boiler. This contributed to an increase in maintenance expense, which rose by $8 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third. Cellulose fibers results included $113 million of special items comprised primarily of $150 million and alternative fuel credits. Excluding special items the segment earned $34 million on fourth quarter operations. I will close my portion of this morning\u2019s call with some brief comments about the Biomass Crop Assistance Program or BCAP.", "On February 3rd, US Department of Agriculture discontinued approval of new matching payment for BCAP. Our southern and western timberlands began delivering eligible biomass to third parties on January 15th. Prior to the February 3rd notice we had filed for BCAP matching payments of approximately $1 million based on one month of BCAP operations. However, the level of any future benefit will depend upon receiving further clarification on final program eligibility rules.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Burrows who will discuss our real estate business.", "Larry Burrows", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning. Now housing market in some weaker geographies show signs of stabilizing; others remained extremely challenging. In each of our markets conflicting forces are influencing both the supply and the demand for housings. On the demand side, potential homebuyers balanced record affordability and the benefit of an extended federal tax credit against higher employment and economic uncertainties. So, customer traffic is low. The buyers that come into our sales offices are highly motivated.", "On the supply side, the declining inventory homes for sale is largely offset by additional foreclosures creating further pressure on home sales prices. These trends are reflected in the key indicators table on chart nine. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 to 2008, WRECO\u2019s sales increased 31% despite a 40% decline in traffic. Our cancellation rate improved by 14 percentage points to 27%, and our backlog of homes sold but not closed increased modestly to 650 units. However, the average price of homes closed declined by almost four percentage points versus one year ago.", "With respect to specific WRECO markets, Washington D.C., Houston and the Puget Sound began to firm in the fourth quarter as both employment and pricing showed early signs of improvement. While Los Angeles to San Diego have held up better due to our positioning within each market, they are not immune to Southern California's overall economic conditions, including above average unemployment.", "Phoenix began to lose momentum toward the end of last year reversing the improved sales velocity observed in mid-2009. Together with the Inland Empire in Las Vegas it remains one of our most difficult markets due to high unemployment and pricing pressure from accelerating foreclosures.", "Our financial results reflect a continued uncertainty in our markets. Earnings before special items improved in the fourth quarter compared to the third. However, that improvement was more than offset by increased impairment charges. Included in our $89 million fourth quarter charge to pretax earnings are $100 million in one-time charges is primarily attributable to a single large impairment in our Washington D.C. market.", "We also realized a loss of $10 million from the sale of land and lots located in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Southern California. Excluding the loss on land and lot sales and the one-time charges, WRECO earned $21 million on fourth quarter operations. I previously discussed actions that we are taking to improve our operating performance and generate cash. Although WRECO\u2019s overall financial results are unacceptable, I am proud of our employees\u2019 accomplishments in those two focus areas.", "In 2009, we reduced land spending, staffing, work-in-progress, standing inventory and costs of construction. We also successfully executed our strategy to divest approximately 5000 logs. This combination of operating costs improvement in sales of non-strategic assets yielded over $100 million of pre-tax operating cash flow in 2009 including positive cash flow from our core single family home building operations.", "2010 will not be an easy year, but our improved cost structure better positions us to manage the changing market conditions we will continue to experience. I am optimistic that our cost discipline combined with the eventual stabilization in our markets will allow WRECO to re-emerge as a highly competitive profitable home building operations.", "I will now turn the call over to Patty to discuss the outlook for the first quarter.", "Patty Bedient", "Thanks Larry, and good morning, everyone. Although overall market conditions continue to be difficult as we enter the New Year, they are much improved compared to a year ago. As we compare the first quarter outlook with the most recently ended fourth quarter there continues to be much uncertainty surrounding the strength of the recovery. I will begin the outlook for our business segment with timberland.", "Domestic log prices in both the west and south are expected to increase slightly over the fourth quarter as industry log supply tightened especially in the south due to unusually wet and cold weather. While fee volumes maybe up slightly as compared to the fourth quarter, we are continuing to defer overall harvest.", "Export volumes in prices are expected to be similar to the fourth quarter. We will likely have increased silvicultural spending and somewhat higher fuel cost in the first quarter. There were no significant sales of non-strategic lands in the fourth quarter. And before considering the effect of any sales that may take place in the first quarter, we anticipate that overall timberland earnings will be comparable to the fourth quarter. In wood products, sales realizations and volumes are expected to increase in the first quarter driven primarily by improvements in both lumber and OSP. Engineered wood realizations are likely to be similar to the fourth quarter on improving volume.", "While we are saying strengthening take place early in the quarter, it is hard to forecast the sustainability of the improved market given the uncertainty that exists in the overall economy, especially around housing. Raw material costs are expected to increase somewhat primarily due to rising log cost. Unit manufacturing cost should be lower as a result of improved operating rate. Losses in our wood products business are expected to be much lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.", "Sales realizations in our cellulose fiber segment are anticipated to increase in the first quarter. The low inventory situation that we saw in the fourth quarter is expected to continue leading to increased prices. On the expense side, fiber costs are expected to increase for our southern softwood mill, as the wet weather I referenced earlier could affect fiber availability. In addition, we anticipate increased costs associated with the first quarter maintenance outages compared with the fourth quarter.", "We expect that maintenance combined with rising fiber cost could offset the increase in sales realization, and as a result earnings in the first quarter are likely to be comparable to the fourth quarter after excluding the effect of alternative fuel mixture tax credits.", "Moving on to our real estate segment. The first quarter is traditionally the slowest quarter of the year for home closings. Closings in our single family home building business will be significantly lower in the first quarter. We expect to close less than 400 homes this quarter compared with the 778 closed in the fourth quarter. We also anticipate that margins will be lower due to lower average home price driven primarily by mix. As a result, we expect a loss in our single family home building business in the first quarter. However, we anticipate that this loss will be more than offset by the sales of two commercial partnership interests that contributed $33 million to earnings in the month of January. Therefore, excluding any asset impairment, we expect that real estate segment to be profitable in the first quarter.", "Now I will conclude with overall financial comments. Capital expenditures for Weyerhaeuser Company for the full year were $215 million. For 2010, we expect the net capital spending will approximate $200 million. This includes expenditures for reforestation.", "We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we received a $138 million from the pension trust as partial repayment of previous loan. The remaining $147 million is scheduled to be repaid in the first half of this year.", "In October, we issued $500 million of 10-year bond and retired over $400 million of debt. Our scheduled 2010 maturity are only about $40 million and are not due until the fourth quarter. In the first quarter we expect to spend approximately $150 million for a semi-annual interest payments as well as capital expenditures of over $50 million. We will be filing for our tax refunds of approximately $550 million, and we could receive those funds late in the first quarter or early in the second. And now I\u2019ll wrap up with some comments on REIT conversion. On our December call, I mentioned that our earnings and profits, which must be distributed for a REIT conversion were estimated to be around $6 billion as of the beginning of 2010.", "We are finalizing that number but it may be somewhat less than $6 billion. In addition, the IRS had issued an extension of the revenue procedure that allows REITs to pay dividend with 90% stock and 10% cash. That extension is for two years", "2010 and 2011. Well, the board has not decided how much to pay in cash. At 10%, the cash dividend required for a 2010 earnings and profits distribution would be less than $600 million. We do need shareholder approval to issue the additional shares for the stock portion of the dividend, and the request for that approval will be included in the upcoming proxy statement to be filed later this month.", "As we have previously stated, the earliest and most likely date for our conversion would be this year. We don\u2019t have any further information to provide on this call that anticipate providing further clarity as the year progresses.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.", "Dan Fulton", "Thank you, Patty. As we open the call for your questions this morning, I am going to turn the call back over to Kathy McAuley, and Kathy will lead the Q&A.", "Kathy McAuley", "Sure, good. Thank you, Dan. To execute we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks, good morning. Patty, I was curious if you could confirm if all of your gross debt resides in your legal structure, your taxable REIT subsidiary?", "Patty Bedient", "Well Peter, as we talked about before when we did the restructuring at the beginning of 2009, end of 2008, the primary debt that we hold at Weyerhaeuser Company is with our bondholders and the taxable REIT subsidiary that was set up with primarily our manufacturing asset assumed to the obligation from Weyerhaeuser Company to pay those bonds. So, while our debt actually resides at the Weyerhaeuser liability in terms of the original bond issuance, the obligation to pay that debt is the obligation of the TRS.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Understood, okay. And just to clarify, Patty, is it true that your E&P for 2010 assuming a 2010 conversion that is calculated from the yearend financials of \u201809, is that correct?", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, that\u2019s right.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay.", "Patty Bedient", "So, we\u2019ll be able to finalize that number here shortly. It is a taxable \u2013 or it\u2019s a tax regulation calculation, so it\u2019s not like our retained earnings on our financial statements, and that was the number that I was referencing that will be likely under $6 billion.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And recognizing there is lots of uncertainty on the specifics of what you may do this year, can you help us with a timeline of expected actions, for example, I think there is a shareholder vote in April right, but are there other timelines you can help us with as to when you may consider paying E&P, and what should we expect?", "Patty Bedient", "Sure. Let me go back to the beginning of the year as we talked about, so finalizing the amount of the earnings and profits. And then we will need the shareholder approval for the additional shares to be issued. The board will need to make a decision if we convert in 2010 or payout the E&P in 2010, what's the mix of stock and cash might be? The new piece of information that I shared this morning difference in the call was, traditionally when people have converted they have used as lowest 20% cash for that dividend. And we do now have the flexibility to use 10%, the board will have to make a decision as to what amount of cash they would authorize in that particular distribution. The distribution itself needs to take place or a 2010 conversion needs to take place by the end of 2010.", "So the board is carefully considering what that might be and the timing. In terms of the yearend, we would also need to make sure that we put that conversion in place, the mechanics for the conversion in place, probably no later than the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter, even though you haven\u2019t have yearend to pay it out, we will need to send out information to our shareholders about the amount of cash and stock in that distribution. They have the ability to make an election.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you Patty. I'll turn it over.", "Patty Bedient", "Okay, thanks Pete.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Chip Dillon with Credit Suisse.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes, just two questions. The first one is that, you announced the other day this new dissolving pulp substitute, I think pro 429, and what I want to ask you, is this sort of marking a re-entry into the specially dissolving market. I know you had existed I think with the Cosmopolis a few years ago, and how many tons could you see this ramp up to?", "Dan Fulton", "Well, Chip, we did announce that the introduction of our Pearl 429 which as we indicated is primarily going to be used in lacquers, paints, inks and thickening agents. And it can partially replace dissolving great pulps that are traditionally higher costs. We are still in a very early stage of marking this. We are encouraged by the customer response, but we expect that the markets for this will be relatively modest inside, but it will be a specialty niche market there that we think will create value in increased margins. And so, we look at this introduction of this product as just an ongoing part and example of the new specialty solutions that will bring into the market place that we believe will add value not only for ourselves but also to our customers.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So, you are saying maybe like less than 100,000 tons?", "Dan Fulton", "This time I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate where that would go. We are in the very early stages of it, but we are obviously encouraged by the initial response so far.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, just a last quick question is, you know, Patty thanks for the update on the how the EMP might work, and as you have gone through your shareholder list, obviously if you\u2019re an individual or maybe even an mutual fund with a low basis and your owners are in the high tax bracket, you are basically going to force them to reduce your proportion of ownership in the company if you just do a 10% payout, but that maybe for the greater good if you are relatively small proportion.", "And so have you kind of done any analysis, and can you tell us about how you think about whether it\u2019s going to be 10% or 15% or 20%, you know, specially about how much of your shareholders would be impacted by only getting 10%?", "Patty Bedient", "If I couldn\u2019t give you any further clarification in terms of how many of the shareholders might be impacted by that and certainly it would take place at the time that the distribution would be made. What we have said in terms of the combination of cash versus stock, while it would be true that at 10% cash you would have to have additional cash to pay the tax, if you are taxable. And those dividends would be taxable at 15%. You will also if it\u2019s at 10% be getting more shares than you would at a 15% cash distribution. And differently than some other distributions because this is taxable, shareholders will have full tax basis in those shares. So they could have left to sell those additional shares, take that cash to then pay the tax that would be due on the cash or on the total distribution.", "So it's difficult to say what portion of the shareholder base is taxable and what decision shareholders might make as a result of that, but they are net out of pocket at the end of the day. Cash perspective would be the same whether we did a 10% cash or a 15% cash because they\u2019ll be getting more stock if we did 15%, or less stock if we did 15% than they would have if they got 10.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Mark Connelly with Sterne Agee.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Thank you. Two parts to my question, first is, with how weak that your business has been in terms of log sales over the last couple of years in these increased deferrals, is it enough to affect your timber rotations? And do we need to think about your wood makes any different, but in the past you made some strategic changes in the rotations. I am just wondering if this cumulative effects since 2006 might be big enough that we start thinking about your wood mix differently?", "Dan Fulton", "Well, I think Mark, over the long haul it won\u2019t have a material impact as we go forward. We have obviously had deferrals in light of what the economics are, in terms of harvesting now as opposed to deferring for a few years. So, potentially if this was to continue for a very extended time, we might have to re-look at that. But, at this point in time now, we don\u2019t anticipate making any substantial changes to our several cultural regions.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up, your cancellation made obviously in the real estate business is better than it was in 2009, did you think of that as stabilized nor improving at this point?", "Dan Fulton", "I would hope Mark that certainly they were stabilized and we would hope that we would see some small improvement.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay, thank you.", "Dan Fulton", "Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "The next question will come from George Staphos with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone, good morning. I just wanted to confirm, when we look at the free cash flow, obviously from very, very low levels, you nonetheless showed progress, it would appear that you were mostly positive on free cash flow, and it doesn\u2019t look like there was much effect or benefit from the receipt of the alt fuels tax cut. I just wanted to confirm that to start?", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, George, this is Patty. We have just under $30 million of receipt of alternative fuel tax credits in the quarter. The remainder of those funds will be received in conjunction with the tax returns.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks. Second question around free cash flow again, do you think there is further opportunity within the operating businesses to bring working capital down further or have you hit as much productivity and optimization as you will see at this juncture, said differently, can you just maintain more or less re-cash breakeven given the markets and holding pricing constant with current levels into the first several quarters of 2010.", "Tom Gideon", "George, this is Tom. We did over the last two years as we\u2019ve gone through this downturn has really work our working capitals while reducing our operating costs. We did make substantial reductions in our working capital over 2009 compared to 2008. It doesn\u2019t necessary have the same level of opportunity going forward but it is still an area that we\u2019re going to continue to work diligently.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so should we then assume just to conclude that now you can stay more or less around breakeven from a cash standpoint from here on now borrowing changes in the market?", "Tom Gideon", "Well, again we\u2019re going to take a look at what we need to do against what the market does, and the demand that we can supply profitably, and that will dictate whether or not we stay or good to cost breakeven across the entire forest product segments.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Last question, and I\u2019ll turn it over, a similar type of question Tom for you. If we hold price constant, and given what you are seeing in terms of your conversion market, do you think we\u2019re at a point where the wood products business can get to breakeven or better by the conclusion of 2010. And what is some of the parameters around that occurring or not as you think about them? Thanks very much. Good luck in the quarter.", "Tom Gideon", "Well, George, we\u2019re encouraged by what we've seen obviously so far in January, but again the first four weeks don\u2019t necessarily determine how the remainder of the year will go. We are presently surprised by the level of volume and demand that we see as well as the price depreciation that we have seen particularly in lumber and OSP. We think we have done a good job this year in reducing our costs and positioning ourselves to take full advantage of these improving markets.", "And as we look at it compared to 2008, our sales were down 43% or nearly $1.5 billion, and yet even despite those really difficult conditions we actually improved our operating earnings year-over-year by reducing our cost of goods sold and our SG&A. We are going to continue to work those things. We are going to take advantage of the market as they present to us. And as they say, the watchword is, hey let\u2019s continue to rationalize our operations as appropriate. Let\u2019s make sure that we are optimizing our core set of operations and matching supply against demand, and then we are going to continue to rigorously reduce costs where we can out of our system. With that no guarantees but we feel --", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Understood.", "Tom Gideon", "We feel much better about where we were at this time last year than going forward.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thanks very much. Good luck in the quarter.", "Patty Bedient", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Hi. Carrying on the last comment for a minute, can you talk a little bit more that any theories you have and what you are seeing in terms of wood products market which is obviously fairly unusual for this time of year?", "Tom Gideon", "Well Gail, as we look at that we think what we saw during 2009 was besides just great volatility there was a lot of destocking, I guess, at the inventory channel throughout the system and that wasn\u2019t just at the producer level but that was all the way through the distribution channel, all the way, to our customers and when you took a long time for that to work itself out.", "So, at this point in time what we think we are seeing is a basically while we think as a motto maybe whatever normalized maybe, replenishment of inventory as product is sold, where people are buying on a more consistent basis, but at this point in time we're not willing to speculate whether or not we've seen any for underline demand increase at this point in time. So, we're taking a watch and see approach.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And then similar question on asset sales, particularly land sales, lots sale and the timberlands in the west that you've been marketing. Can you give us an update on how the marketing on the timberlands is going, and what your plans might be for lot sales in 2010?", "Dan Fulton", "Okay. We'll start with timberlands and then we\u2019ll move it to Larry after Tom comments.", "Tom Gideon", "Yes, Gail, we had announced earlier that we are at least exploring the potential sale of 88,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in the west. We have been evaluating bids from interested parties. And again, what we'll do is we'll take a look at those as they come forth, and if they\u2019re appropriate in their values that we feel good about then we'll consummate the sale. And that\u2019s basically the status of where we are in that progress for those lands.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "And just, has interest been good or too early to say?", "Tom Gideon", "Say again, Gail, please.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Has interest been good so far or just too early to say?", "Tom Gideon", "We have had very good interest, we're still trying to evaluate what that does in terms of how that translate into the kind of values that we think are appropriate for the quality of lands that we are offering for sale.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Thank you.", "Larry Burrow", "Gail, as it relates to WRECO, about a year ago we talked about having kind of a change in some of our assets in where we had that kind of, define them as move them to non-strategic, and we talked about approximately 4,000 lots that we were looking to sell. And in my remarks this morning, we accomplished that and we actually did a little bit more of as we went out to the market. As we think about 2010, we have always kind of been long on land and we have been rewarded for that, and we think that in a market where you are seeing some land like builders there may be an opportunity at some point in time for us to be thinking about selling lots in a profitable basis.", "I am not saying that the markets come back and it is demonstrating that yet, but that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re thinking about. Again, we\u2019ll also be looking at our inventory in land and if we can improve it one way or the other, and if it means that we may have some other assets sales we kind of look at that as we get further into the year.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. And I just wanted to ask some questions mainly around timberland, is there any of that drop-off in the fourth quarter, was any of that weather related or was it all of that really just a financial decision?", "Tom Gideon", "Well, it was a combination as we went forward with some of our financial decisions. Some of it was the fact that we saw experienced lower demand which required less volume coming forward, and then in the south we did have weather restrictions somewhere in the magnitude of about 250,000 cubic meters that were strictly due to the poor weather conditions.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay and then I am just curious, Tom, it seems like not only you but a lot of theme [ph] homes and private land owners have been holding timber off of the market because pricing and demand has been so weak, how do you think about sort of potential pent-up supply coming into the market when things start to pick up? Is this going to be an issue?", "Tom Gideon", "I can't really speculate on that, Mark, going forward, but what I can focus on is the real pressure for us is how we reposition ourselves for residential market recovery. So what we do is, we are ensuring that we have a broad base of both internal as well as third-party customers, both domestic as well as international that allows us to flow our logs to the best value. So for example, in this year we have actually reestablished good solid markets to China for volumes that they haven\u2019t been taken in recent years. So in addition to that we\u2019re maintaining our course set of harvesting capabilities that will allow us to increase harvest demand and values one. So, we are positioning ourselves based on what we know and against the customer base that we have established going forward.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And understanding that it's only early February here, Tom, do you have a just a ballpark estimate for kind of what your harvest volumes are likely to do in 2010 versus 2009?", "Tom Gideon", "We don\u2019t forecast out beyond the quarter. We will see for the first quarter, we will see a seasonally improved volume compared to the fourth quarter but it will be down from 2009 first quarter.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then finally for Larry. I just wondered if you\u2019d be willing to comment at all on a article that was in Wall Street Journal, I think yesterday just on consolidation and potential consolidation in the home building market. And I am particularly interested with you guys if you can give us any more color on how big the land book is particularly around San Diego and Los Angeles for you guys?", "Larry Burrows", "Let me talk about, Mark, kind of land. We had said that we talked about that we own or control around 100,000 lots, about 40% of those are owned, the others roughly 60% are controlled through options of the 40,000ish plots that we owned, about half of those approximately are in California. And the majority of those are split between, I would say, probably we have about 25% in the LA Ventura area and the balance is split roughly even between San Diego and the Inland Empire.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. All right, that\u2019s very helpful. And any thoughts on that article?", "Larry Burrows", "No, not, I really don\u2019t want to get in a position to speculating what may or may not happen in terms of consolidating and what other guys might do, we\u2019re kind of focused on kind of what we are doing.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "As you should be. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Claudia Houston with JPMorgan.", "Claudia Houston \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks very much. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Wondering, I was just curious if you have a housing outlook, housing stat forecast that you are working from for 2010 and then maybe how that\u2019s changed, or if it\u2019s changed from last quarter?", "Larry Burrow", "I will address that, Claudia. I don\u2019t want to share our internal outlook. We have an internally generated forecast. We look at other sources of information. We are expecting improved conditions in 2010 versus 2009. We are expecting a slow steady recovery, and that is informing decisions that we make in our home building business as well as our wood products business and our timberlands business.", "Claudia Houston \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, thanks. And then shifting gears, on the, your corporate expenses sort of moved around a lot, I was wondering if have any guidance for 2010, a normal range for that? And then also any update on pension expense and any potential contribution for 2010?", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, Claudia, this is Patty. In terms of the corporate segment, it is as you think about forecasting it, difficult to forecast because it is where a lot of moving parts end up like foreign exchange, variable comp, and our transportation assets are in that segment as well. But if you think about going forward I would say something around the $15 million to $20 million a quarter, certainly at that level as we think about the first quarter is probably a good rule of thumb.", "I think you also asked about pensions, looking at pension and other post-retirement benefit. We don\u2019t have the final number yet for the year of 2010, but I would expect that we will have a slight pension credit, and we will have other post-retirement expense, probably likely to offset each other as you think about it. So I would probably just keep that as a flat number.", "In terms of contribution that we look forward for the pension at 2010, speaking to the minimum contribution that we would be require to make, I think as we sit here today with the preliminary estimates that we have in, it looks like we may need to make a minimum contribution to one of the plans in the level of about $30 million. Now that will be for the year of 2010, but we have actually until the fall of 2011 to make that contribution. We\u2019re also looking at whether or not we may want to make some voluntary contributions into those plants. So I hope that\u2019s helpful.", "Claudia Houston \u2013 JPMorgan", "That is. Thank you very much.", "Patty Bedient", "Welcome.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Thank you. Dan, last call you had finished up saying that the climate bill being debated and congress has the potential to have a meaningful impact on your timberlands activities. Any update on that?", "Dan Fulton", "Well, as you see what happened with healthcare, quite frankly, it's hard to speculate, Mark. Our view is that there is some renewed energy around attempted passage of a climate bill, we are keenly focused on what the outcome maybe as I mentioned in the call last quarter. There is potential impact on the operation and management of our timberlands. As we look at that resource we have certainly the potential for carbon credits. There are critical definitions around biomass that become addressed in both climate and energy builds. So, we are tracking closely, but I cannot handicap Congress at this point other than to say that we are engaged in the process and we are strongly representing the interest of our assets.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. Fair enough. And just a few clarifications, so the $550 million tax receivable that you are expecting to get in March or April, does that include the benefits from the alternative fuel?", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, it does, Mark.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. And so the $600 million that's on the balance sheet does that -- that also I take it and does include the alternative fuel mixture credits?", "Patty Bedient", "Yes. And the difference between the 600 and 550 is a combination of some State refund as well as some foreign tax credits that will be freed up, that will have to file amended return to get. So, those -- the remainder of that will likely come in over the remainder of the year.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay.", "Patty Bedient", "And we would anticipate getting almost 550. Again, at the end of the first quarter at the earliest, but at the beginning of the second if not then.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "And then bringing two prior questions together, I know if you would be willing to give us an assessment on what type of housing start environment do you think is necessary for your key businesses to be in balance where you presumably can we start seeing profitability?", "Dan Fulton", "The goal in each of our businesses is to be profitable with the housing starts that were dealt, Mark. So we made significant improvements across our wood products business over the last year to drive down cost, to be more competitive, as Tom said to match our production with profitable demand. In the case of our real estate business, we came through this downturn, as Larry noted we had profitable single family operations in Q4, Patty talked about the first quarter activity, and as you know, in the first quarter starts are relatively low. And so you see a typical seasonal falloff, but we are projecting an increasing activity in 2010. And our goal in both of those businesses is to be profitable at the level of housing starts that we see in front of us.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay, but I just want to make sure I\u2019ve heard that right. So, you think it\u2019s a realistic goal to potentially be profitable in the wood products as well as, of course, homebuilding business in 2010?", "Dan Fulton", "I\u2019m not making a projection for profitability for the year. We provide guidance one quarter out, but our goal in all of our businesses is to be producing products at a profitable level. We certainly have our challenges in this downturn. So I can't project for the year, but we are making changes that we need to make in order to operate in the conditions that we find ourselves in.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Fair enough. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Patty Bedient", "Next question.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Steven Chercover with D. A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of quick ones. First of all, with respect to Pearl 429, will sales prices and margins be similar to those of which left hold, can you give us a sense?", "Tom Gideon", "Again, what we anticipate is that margins there will be enhanced above the products that we currently have in the market place.", "Steven Chercover \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Including fluff in that. Okay and then with respect to the REIT is it your opinion that it\u2019s important to have a dividend that\u2019s competitive with the peer group?", "Dan Fulton", "The board is carefully considering what the appropriate dividend level should be as we convert to a REIT that\u2019s a significant focus for us this year. As Patty said, we have a shareholder growth that will occur at our meeting in April regarding the issuance of shares, and so, we are actively engaged in carefully considering what the appropriate dividend is going forward. And it\u2019s really critical for us that we communicate that at the time that we announced the timing of conversion. So, we have got the April shareholder growth and we look forward to providing further guidance in May as we have our Investor Conference.", "Steven Chercover \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co.", "And just as a follow on to that, if the EMP purge was done early well prior to the year end, would you have to start behaving as a REIT, by that I mean, paying the dividend that you assume is reasonable?", "Patty Bedient", "Steve, in terms of what we would do if we purged in 2010 and converted for the year of 2010, that means we would be operating as a REIT for the full year. In terms of the amount of the dividend, there are really two questions, one would be the amounts that we would need to distribute to our shareholders in order to not have to pay tax on that dividend. That dividend in terms of the level would likely be very low in 2010 given the amount of harvest deferral or qualifying timber income in this very depressed economic cycle.", "So I wouldn\u2019t equate necessarily the two, there is amount that you would need to divest in terms to meet the \u2013 pass through tax rules and then there will be amount that the board will take \u2013 they will take that into consideration but then they\u2019ll also look at just what would be the appropriate dividend level overall, so one minimum level driven by regulation, the other driven by dividend policy.", "Steven Chercover \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Paul Quinn of RBC.", "Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yes, thanks, just follow-up questions on the strength in building material markets. We are seeing a pretty strong lumber pricing rally right now, just wondering in term of, I guess the question is, are you seeing signs of improvement on the lumber demand or is this simply restocking?", "Dan Fulton", "Well, again as I mentioned earlier, it's again too early to tell. We certainly believe that there is some restocking and replenishment that\u2019s going on. And we do see the downstream replenishment being on a more on a, I guess consistent basis in terms of how often that they do replenish, but in terms of whether that\u2019s truly an indication of underlying demand is going to be stronger and the timing of that, it still is tricky for us to tell. But we certainly are enjoying the improved lumber in our realizations as we speak.", "Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "You\u2019ve taken a wait-and-see approach, I guess, on increasing production but for the industry as a whole, what\u2019s your assessment of the ease of increasing production?", "Larry Burrow", "I really can speculate on what the industry as a whole is doing, but as I have indicated on prior calls, we actually are on a weekly basis evaluating market conditions against where we are and supplying product to the market. And so, we do try to make real-time decisions in terms of what\u2019s appropriate, in terms of the supply that we bring forward.", "Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, And then just lastly just on Chinese markets for logs and lumber, it has created some excitement up here in my province DC, just wondering whether you are seeing the same sort of level of pick up?", "Dan Fulton", "Well, we are certainly seeing on the log supply component there, Paul. But what we have actually seen over the last year, we have seen an increased takeaway of what would typically have been a domestic GC type quality of log going into the construction market in China. We do have takeaway of lumber into China primarily from our Canadian operations, but at this time the predominant amount of volumes that\u2019s going here is basically lower-grade material.", "Now this is an area that has opportunity, but we\u2019re obviously going to monitor it appropriately and if it materializes we are certainly going to participate appropriately.", "Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks guys. Best of Luck.", "Kathy McAuley", "We have time for one more question here.", "Operator", "Yes, Ma\u2019am. Our final question will come from Joshua Zaret with Longbow Research.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Thank you. I have three quick questions. First, when you report on real estate earnings for the first quarter, are you going to treat the contribution, the 33 million contribution from the sale of the partnership increase as your current income or you\u2019re going to treat that as unusual income? And the reason for that.", "Patty Bedient", "That will be a part of our regular segment mostly likely Josh, because we do have partnership interest that we are participating in as a part of the business, and it is not unusual for us to have sales of partnership interest, if you look back to the segment you will see those. But, when we do have them, we try to isolate those and give you information around them, so that you can separately evaluate our home-building business, our partnership investments, which are all part of the business of the real estate segment.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay, so you will include, I just want to make sure you are all on the same level, but one missing line. You reported fourth quarter real-estate earnings in the release as 21 million and in your handout as 11. Clearly that\u2019s the loss on the land of lots sales. I would think that would be included in your income and use the 21 because it seems to be recurring but why do you have two different numbers, is there something that obviously should be one number? And which one should it be in your opinion, 21 or 11?", "Patty Bedient", "Well, again, land and lot sales are not an abnormal part of the business of our real-estate segments. We try to be very explicit in terms of giving you information about what the various pieces of the real-estate segment has to do. So land and lot sales marked as of $10 million although it's a little larger number than normally because as we talked about in fourth quarter, we moved the significant amount of lots to take advantage of some tax losses that were in those sales, and....", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "I don\u2019t disagree with that, I would just hope you would be consistent on your material since it does create some confusion there. And then my last question, Tom, you talked about your timberland sale, can you sort of give us species age class, et cetera, so we can sort of get a feel for what you are selling?", "Tom Gideon", "As I get back to that, that will be comparable primarily if it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t have the details in front of me here, Josh, but it\u2019s primarily likewise probably in the magnitude of 65% plus, if there are lots of the lower age class, and it would be comparable to the material and the quality of acreage that was included in our South Bin [ph] sale of spring of last year.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Yes, it sounds like that, great. Those were my questions. Thank you very much.", "Tom Gideon", "Okay?", "Kathy McAuley", "Thank you. Dan?", "Dan Fulton", "I would like to make a couple of final wrap-up comments as we end the call. I would like to talk about our safety performance during 2009. Those of you on the phone will follow this know that operating safely is a core Weyerhaeuser value. We care about safety because of a concern for the wellbeing of our employees, because we believe there is a high correlation between safety performance, operating efficiency and product quality, because our safety record translates directly into lower operating and employment costs and because it\u2019s simply the right thing to do.", "For those of you who have had the opportunity to visit our operations whether in the woods, at our plants and mills, our home building projects or even in our offices, you know that all of our employees are keenly focused on keeping everyone on all of our sites safe. As a result of this long-term commitment to improving safety across the company, we ended 2009 with an annual recordable incident rate of 0.62, which is the lowest in our history and the best in the industry.", "I am taking the time to share the good news in order to recognize the accomplishments of our employees but more importantly to make another point. Our success in safety management shows what's achievable if we are relentless in holding ourselves accountable to a clear objective. I'm committed to focusing that same levels of commitments across our entire company to deliver the financial results that our shareholders deserve.", "As I stated at the top of this call, our company has been operating in an extremely difficult economic environment since the precipitous downturn in the US housing began. And in order to weather this storm, our employees, our retirees, our operating communities and our shareholders have all made sacrifices. I want to thank all of you for your support during this difficult period, entering 2010 in a still uncertain and fragile environment, I'll state again that I'm confident that we will deliver improved financial performance. And I thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call.

My name is Thea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Weyerhaeuser's Quarter Two Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy McAuley. Ma'am, you may begin.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I am Kathy McCauley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tom Gideon, Executive Vice President, Forest Products; and Larry Burrows, President, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release and materials for this call can be found at the website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.", "Also on this call, we will update shareholders on the steps remaining in the special dividend process. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $14 million or $0.07 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Significant after-tax items in the second quarter were a charge of $33 million or $0.16 per share for the early extinguishment of debt. In the quarter, we redeemed $548 million of the March 2012 bond. A gain of $5 million from Wood Products asset sales, primarily the Delta, BC, hardwood lumber mill. Including these items, the company reported net earnings of $42 million or $0.20 per diluted share. A GAAP reconciliation of special items is available on our website in the earnings information package.", "Please turn to Chart 4 in the earnings information package as I will discuss the waterfall chart. Chart 4 is a bar chart detailing the changes in the contribution to earnings before special items, interest and taxes.", "Changes in Weyerhaeuser's segment earnings from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter were as follows, beginning with the first bar on the left-hand side of the page. In the first quarter, Weyerhaeuser earned $80 million before special items, interest and taxes. Proceeding from left to right across the waterfall chart, we begin the discussion with Timberlands. Timberlands' earnings were $11 million lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter. Higher domestic and export log prices were offset by fewer nonstrategic land dispositions. Costs were also higher as silviculture activities postponed from the first quarter due to weather conditions occurred in the second quarter.", "Wood Products\u2019 earnings were $52 million higher in Q2. This improvement was due to higher average price realizations for all major product lines, with significant increases in average oriented strand board, plywood and [audio gap 13:17] prices. OSB, plywood and lumber volumes also improved. These benefits were offset by higher log costs. Manufacturing costs were also higher due to the downtime taken late in the quarter.", "Cellulose Fibers contributed $55 million more to earnings in the second quarter. This improvement was largely driven by higher price realizations with a benefit from lower energy costs. Real Estate\u2019s contribution to earnings was $4 million lower in the second quarter from the first quarter. The volume of single-family closings was higher and margins increased. However, there was no partnership income in the second quarter.", "Corporate & Other was $4 million lower in the second quarter due to less favorable foreign exchange translation. The final bar to the right is Weyerhaeuser's second quarter pretax earnings of $168 million. I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel Fulton", "Thank you, Kathy. As I look back on the quarter, I'm very pleased with our progress on a number of fronts. We improved our operating earnings. All businesses were cash positive from operations, and we took the last major step towards our REIT conversions.", "Beginning with our performance, I'm encouraged by our ability to profitably manage operations in an uncertain economic climate without a sustained housing recovery. Timberlands delivered strong operating performance despite continued harvest deferrals, and we saw significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in Wood Products, Cellulose Fibers and single-family real estate operations. As Kathy noted, this improved performance generated $168 million in operating earnings before special items. This is an improvement of $88 million over the first quarter, and more significantly, it is an improvement of $229 million from one year ago.", "Last quarter, I noted that the pace of the housing recovery remained uncertain, and this continues to be true three months later. This has been especially evident in the market retreat following the expiration of the federal home buyer tax credit at the end of April.", "I also noted last quarter that we needed job growth and renewed consumer confidence to drive a sustained housing recovery, and this is still the case. The extreme volatility in Wood Products' prices during the quarter is further evidence of the challenging economic environment in which we are operating.", "Though some of our overall progress this quarter comes because of slightly improved economic conditions, much of the improvement in our financial performance, particularly in our Wood Products and Real Estate businesses, is attributable to our ability to improve our own operational performance at lower levels of housing starts. Tom and Larry will discuss the quarterly results of our operations, and they'll provide some additional color on how we've been dealing with current business conditions while positioning for the future.", "Finally, we continue to move forward on the path of reconversion to support our core Timberlands strategy. On July 11, shortly after the close of the quarter, we took the final major step in that process by declaring a special dividend to pay out our accumulated undistributed earnings and profits. Later in the call, Patty will review the remaining activities we will complete to pay the special dividend on September 1, while also providing our third quarter outlook.", "Now I will turn the call over to Tom Gideon, who will discuss our second quarter performance for our Forest Products businesses. Tom?", "Thomas Gideon", "Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Operating earnings from our forest products businesses improved by $96 million in the second quarter compared to the first, even though the strong market conditions we experienced in the quarter were partially offset by a significant deterioration in Wood Products markets beginning in early May. I will start by discussing our Timberlands business referenced on Chart 5.", "Log markets strengthened in the first half of the second quarter, as higher operating rates among wood product producers combined with improved export markets created strong demand for our logs. This resulted in higher revenue from our U.S. operations in the second quarter compared to the first, as both sales realizations and volumes improved. Domestic log realizations increased modestly, primarily in the West, and export realizations also strengthened. Export sales volumes increased substantially due to the increased shipments of Douglas fir into Japan and China. Sales into the Chinese and Korean markets comprised 20% of our total export sales volume in the second quarter compared to 13% in the first. However, competition in these markets is increasing rapidly. Domestic log sales volumes increased in the second quarter as the decline in sales to our own mills due to reduced operating rates was more than offset by an increase in sales to third parties. By the end of the quarter, weak demand for wood products was beginning to affect log markets as well, and we reduced harvest operations in the West at the end of the quarter to respond to lower demand. We also rebalanced our southern harvest to planned deferral levels following the pull-forward of some volume in the first quarter to supply several of our cellulose fibers and iLevel mills during weather-related procurement challenges. As a result, total fee harvest declined by 8% in the second quarter compared to the first.", "I would also like to touch on harvest activity in our Canadian forest land operations, which declined seasonally in the second quarter. Canadian harvest typically declines quite sharply in the spring, as logging activity becomes extremely difficult due to the spring thaw. Changes in Canadian logging activity do not affect the Timberlands segment\u2019s earnings because we transfer those logs to our iLevel and Cellulose Fibers manufacturing facilities at cost. However, the reduced activity is reflected on the segment\u2019s income statement as a decline in intersegment sales with equally offsetting expenses. Expenses associated with our U.S. Timberlands increased slightly in the second quarter compared to the first. We incurred seasonably higher road-building costs, and silvicultural costs also increased, as we caught up on activity that had been deferred from first quarter due to wet weather. Earnings from our core Timberlands operations improved by $6 million quarter-to-quarter. However, this improvement was more than offset by a $17 million decline in earnings from the disposition of nonstrategic Timberlands. Overall, Timberlands\u2019 earnings declined in the second quarter compared to the first, and the segment earned $70 million on second quarter operations.", "I will now turn to Wood Products, referenced on Charts 6 and 7. Lumber and OSB prices climbed rapidly during the first half of the second quarter, and Weyerhaeuser experienced strong demand across nearly all of our product lines, as our customers rapidly restocked depleted inventories. Industry-indicated prices for both products peaked in the last week of April. We have said before that any lasting recovery must be supported by a sustained increase in core housing demand, and wood product markets will remain volatile until single-family housing starts to recover. Wood product markets begun to correct in early May as it became evident that housing starts had been pulled forward due to the expiring housing tax credit. Demand eroded almost overnight and indicated prices for OSB and lumber fell rapidly, declining 50% and 32%, respectively, between the end of April and the end of June. Weyerhaeuser experienced improved price realizations and strong revenues through mid-to-late May due to favorable mix and a slight lag between price realizations and market indicators. However, profitability declined substantially across all of our product lines in the month of June. Price realizations for lumber and OSB declined rapidly, and orders for engineered Wood Products plummeted due to declining housing starts and inventory drawdowns by dealers.", "Comparing first and second quarter results for the Wood Products segment, revenues increased 30% in the second quarter due to improved quarterly average realizations across nearly all of our product lines. On average OSB realizations increased 35% quarter-to-quarter, and lumber increased 10% while sales volumes increased 31% and 16%, respectively. Sales realizations for engineered lumber improved modestly, on flat to slightly declining volumes. Manufacturing costs increased compared to the first quarter due to higher log cost and substantial production curtailments needed to match supply with eroding demand. This downtime which occurred mostly during the month of June affected nearly all of our product lines and geographies. Our lumber system took 32 weeks of downtime in the second quarter, including 30 weeks in the month of June. This compared to 29 weeks of downtime for the entire first quarter.", "Included in the second quarter wood products earnings are gains on asset sales of $8 million compared to gains of $44 million in the first quarter. Excluding these special items, Wood Products lost $11 million in second quarter operations, an improvement of $52 million compared to the first quarter. In many ways I am encouraged by our performance this quarter. Our year-over-year financial performance has improved by nearly $160 million on only slightly higher sales volumes. Wood Products operations were cash positive for the second quarter as well as year-to-date. While we certainly benefited from the rally and realizations, it is also apparent that the dramatically reduced cost structure that we put into motion last year is now being reflected in improved operating results. At the same time, I'm disappointed that we do not post stronger second quarter results. Though our OSB and Lumber segments performed well in the second quarter, our Engineered Wood and Distribution operations remain severely challenged due to the lack of housing starts. We will continue to monitor Wood Products markets very closely and adjust our operating posture on a weekly basis to ensure that we match supply with demand. While we are optimistic about our long-term financial prospects, the extraordinary market volatility we experienced in the second quarter underscores the absolute need to stay focused on reducing our cost structure and improving our margins.", "I will now turn to our Cellulose Fibers business, referenced on Chart 8. Pulp markets remained robust throughout the second quarter and our Cellulose Fibers business delivered excellent operating results, with both our pulp and liquid packaging businesses performing very well. The segment's increased earnings were primarily driven by higher revenues, as average pulp price realizations rose by $94 per ton relative to the first quarter.", "Second quarter once again included significant maintenance expense, as we completed scheduled annual maintenance outages at three of our mills. In total, Cellulose Fibers\u2019 earnings increased in the second quarter compared to the first as the segment earned $74 million.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Burrows, who will discuss our Real Estate business.", "Larry Burrows", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning. I am proud of the successful execution that has enabled RECO to be profitable for the second consecutive quarter. RECO generated a $27 million contribution to pretax earnings in the second quarter of 2010. This represents a significant improvement over the second quarter of 2009 when we lost $50 million, including a $14 million loss in single-family operations. We made considerable progress on the single-family front, higher-than-planned closings and improved margins enabled our single-family Homebuilding operations to earn $14 million in the second quarter. We supplemented these earnings with $13 million from the sale of land and lots, as we executed our strategy of opportunistically and profitably selling land to land-light builders. Our improved performance is the result of the many actions we have taken as I have outlined in past calls. Reducing SG&A, lowering cost of goods sold, repositioning communities and introducing smaller and less expensive product, as well as managing our standing inventory. We continue to leverage these improvements particularly in the face of deteriorating market conditions, as we experienced during the latter half of the second quarter.", "Overall, our housing markets remain unsettled, with low consumer confidence and high unemployment outweighing attractive mortgage rates and record affordability. Continued foreclosures, short sales and the building shadow inventory of delinquent loans are placing downward pressure on new home sales prices. The second quarter\u2019s traditionally the height of the selling season when we build a backlog of homes to be closed later in the year. This momentum did not materialize in the quarter, suggesting that the spring selling season may have concluded early upon the expiration of the Federal Tax Credit.", "As illustrated in the key indicators' table on Chart 9, sales declined 21% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the first on 26% lower traffic, and our backlog of homes sold, but not closed, declined by 134 units. With respect to specific RECO markets, San Diego remains active across all price points, and our local value propositions continues to resonate well in that market. Washington, D.C. also remains strong, with market activity focused on closer-run communities. The Houston market is now softening due to concerns about employment prospects within the aerospace and extraction industries. Las Vegas and Los Angeles remain weak, Puget Sound and Phoenix have softened modestly since the first quarter and though the Inland Empire as a whole remains challenged our positioning has helped us to perform well in that market. Fundamental to RECO success is our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, adjusting our offerings market by market to serve demand better. During our May Investors Meeting, I highlighted several examples of our local agility, and we continue to advance those products. Our Living Smart product, which we recently introduced in the Inland Empire has a starting price in the high $100,000s. This offering has been highly successful, and we have adapted it for introduction in the Las Vegas market. Virtually every existing and new community contains freshly designed and value-engineered product targeted to evolving market tastes. I'm pleased with RECO\u2019s second quarter accomplishments. I believe we are well positioned to adjust to the more challenging market the third quarter may bring. I will now turn the call over to Patty to discuss the outlook for the quarter.", "Patrica Bedient", "Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start the outlook with Timberlands. Domestic log sales realizations are expected to decrease in response to the weak wood products market. Export realizations are expected to increase somewhat due to mix. Silvicultural costs should increase seasonally. Excluding the effect of non-strategic land sales we anticipate that earnings in our Timberlands segment will be lower in the third quarter compared to the second. In Wood Products, lumber sales realizations are expected to decrease by over 15% on slight increases in volume. OSB realizations are likely to decrease by over 30% compared to the second quarter while sales volume should be flat. Engineered Wood sales realizations are anticipated to increase 6% to 8% on decreasing volume. Log costs should be slightly lower. Overall manufacturing costs are expected to decrease in Q3 compared to Q2, primarily for lumber, as a result of slightly favorable operating rates, although Engineered Wood Products\u2019 production costs are expected to rise slightly as volumes decrease. Overall, we expect a significantly larger loss in the third quarter compared to the second due to significantly lower sales realizations, many of which are expected to be even lower than the first quarter.", "In Cellulose Fibers, we expect average sales realizations will be higher in the third quarter compared to the second. We are starting to see some softening in the market as global supply, which was disrupted earlier in the year by the Chilean earthquake, European strikes and adverse weather conditions, comes back online. However, our demand remains strong and inventories are at very low levels. Maintenance costs and productivity in the third quarter should be very favorable as we have no planned annual outages scheduled for the third quarter compared to three in the second quarter. As a result, we expect more volume at lower cost.", "Earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should be substantially greater in the third quarter compared to the second. In our Real Estate segment, single-family sales activity has slowed significantly so far in the quarter. Competition for the shrinking pool of buyers is intense. Contract cancellation rates are expected to remain high as foreclosures and short sales are prevalent in most of our markets. We expect to close approximately 100 fewer homes in the third quarter compared to the second. Average prices for Q3 are anticipated to approximate Q2 prices but with slightly lower margins. We expect break-even results from our single-family Homebuilding operation. No major non-single-family transactions are planned for Q3. Capital expenditures for Weyerhaeuser Co. were just over $100 million for the first six months of this year, and we anticipate that net capital expenditures for the year will be just over $200 million. We ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments compared to $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. We generated approximately $240 million of cash from operations during the quarter. The most significant use of cash in the quarter was approximately $600 million that was used to repurchase $548 million of our 2012 bond maturities. We do not have any significant debt maturities until 2012.", "Let me now provide you an update on the cellulosic biofuel producers tax credit. The IRS has recently released a memo which allows black liquor to qualify for this credit once companies are registered with the IRS. We anticipate receiving our registration this quarter. During the first part of 2009, we produced approximately 238 million gallons of black liquor, which did not qualify for the alternative fuel mixture credit. This equals $240 million of potential cellulosic biofuel credit at $1.01 per gallon, or $149 million net of tax. Since this credit offsets income tax liability, we could only carry the credit forward. It is still unclear whether the credit can be claimed in the same year as the alternative fuel mixture credit. For the last three quarters of 2009, we claimed $344 million of fuel mixture credit. There's a great deal of uncertainty as to the process for claiming these credits and we are evaluating both credits to determine which credit or mix of credits, if allowed, would add the most value to the company. To wrap up, I would like to update you on the timing and process to pay our special dividend. On July 11, we announced a special dividend of $5.6 billion. This is the final major step in executing our plan to convert to a Real Estate Investment Trust. We held a special conference call on July 12 to discuss this dividend, and the slides used for that call can be accessed from our website. To briefly recap, this distribution is governed by IRS rules, which require the company to pay out its previously undistributed earnings since its inception. The distribution will be made with a combination of stock and cash and the entire distribution is taxable to shareholders as an ordinary dividend. The board has capped the total amount of cash for the special dividend at 10% or $560 million. The remainder of the dividend will be paid in stock. Shareholders may elect to receive the dividend in stock or cash. If the cash election by shareholders exceeds the 10% cap, the cash portion of the dividend will be prorated among the shareholders who elect cash. Those shareholders then will receive the dividend in a combination of cash and stock.", "Chart 11 shows the calendar for this special dividend process. The record date for the special dividend was July 22. This week, we are mailing election forms and a prospectus for the special dividend to shareholders of record on July 22. Those forms are due back by August 23. The number of shares to be issued to pay the special dividend will be determined after the election forms are returned. For purposes of determining the number of shares to be issued, we will average the closing stock prices on August 24, 25 and 26. The expected payment date for both the cash and stock portion of the dividend is September 1.", "Using Chart 12, I would like to walk through the mechanics to determine the number of shares to be issued. On this chart, we are assuming that the average of the three-day closing prices from the valuation date is $16.49, which was yesterday's closing stock price. Again, the number of shares to be issued will depend on the actual stock trading value on the valuation dates in August. We won't know the number of shares to be issued for the ratio between currently outstanding shares and shares to be issued until those August valuation dates. Dividing the stock portion of the dividend of $5.04 billion by the hypothetical average closing price of $16.49 gives us the hypothetical number of shares that would be issued in the special dividend. Of course, market events between now and the valuation dates in August will affect the actual trading value, so this is just a hypothetical estimate of the number of shares to be issued.", "Our reported tax provision for the first six months of this year is computed on a C Corp basis. Once we complete the payout of the special dividend in the third quarter, we will revise our tax expense to reflect the effect of REIT tax status. Our tax rate on current year earnings will decrease and we will also decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately $1 billion. As we reported on our July 12 conference call, we expect to give updated guidance as to our ongoing dividend policy in the fourth quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. Now we're ready to address your questions and comments. And I\u2019ll ask Kathy to open up the call.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Thanks, Dan. Thea will open up the lines now for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from George Staphos with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos", "Just minor housekeeping, share count for the third quarter basically will be an average of two months at 211 million shares and one month at, in this case in the hypothetical, 517 million shares. Is that fair?", "Patrica Bedient", "Yes, what will happen, George, as we\u2019ve talked about, is that this additional share count that will be issued in September will be treated as a stock issuance, not a stock split so we will include those additional shares with no additional proceeds.", "George Staphos", "Okay, right. And again, it's perspective and that\u2019s why it\u2019d be a weighted average for the quarter. Correct?", "Patrica Bedient", "Exactly.  Absolutely.", "George Staphos", "Now within Wood Products, Tom, interested in your views on this. It sounds like the fairly steep reduction in demand was the primary reason why Wood might have been off a bit from maybe your expectations going into the quarter. If that's a fair characterization, do you think at this current level of demand you can be cash breakeven in the third quarter given your current operating profile?", "Thomas Gideon", "Actually, a major component for what happened in the second quarter was rapid declining prices as opposed to demand although both were involved. We had positive results in April and May, which was offset as you mentioned by the dramatic fall-off in prices. Put that into context, we saw prices for both OSB and lumber from May to June on the indicated prices reduced by over $100. For us, given our scale, each $10 change in lumber is a monthly impact of $3 million and each $10 change in OSB is $1.5 million. So on a monthly basis, that impact is $4 million to $5 million. So you can just imagine the impact that we have when we have dramatically falling prices. Having said that, we do look for Q3 to be closer to Q1 in view of our current prices and expected demand. We see our customers are being more deliberate and replenishing their inventories as they revise their housing starts. So at today's prices and volumes, it's going to be difficult to be cash positive for the quarter. Now we were cash positive for Q2 and we are cash positive year-to-date in Wood Products and we saw good, good returns overall in our Lumber and OSB segments for Q2, but the lower demand where it really hit was in our Engineered segments and our Distribution. So we're going to continue to do the things that we can to ensure that we\u2019re using all the leverage to generate positive cash. But it\u2019s difficult market conditions.", "George Staphos", "Tom, at this current level of demand and pricing, do you have the tools or levers by which to become cash breakeven over the rest of the year within Wood Products, i.e. through reducing production or other moves like that?", "Thomas Gideon", "Well it's going to be difficult as I said, if demand doesn't materialize to levels that we\u2019d expected, we're going to continue to review our operating portfolio, we're going to ensure that our supply base and our supporting cost structure is well aligned to that demand. I would also note that in contrast, in Q1 when we had this call, we had built some working capital both in inventories as well as accounts receivable in anticipation of a better Q2. We have worked that off during the second quarter and positioned ourselves for what we see as dampening market conditions that we will see in Q3. So George, it's going to be difficult, but we're going to have the levers we think we have to do what we need to do to come as close to generating cash positive as we can.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "The higher Homebuilding margins that you saw in the quarter, can you give us a sense of what was really driving that? I mean, I would have expected your material cost would be up so was it mix or was it a healthier portfolio?", "Larry Burrows", "Yes, Mark, I think it was a combination of factors. Mix certainly helped, but also it\u2019s beginning to be, we're beginning to feel the impact or the benefit of some of the actions that we've been taking over the last couple of years and so a lot of things that had to do with our construction hard costs, how we reposition communities, introducing new product, combination of those factors have helped in that regard.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And am I right in thinking that your material costs would have been up?", "Larry Burrows", "Not necessarily. We look at being able to manage our material costs all the time, and then while, obviously, there may have been some elements of it that increased in that quarter, there are others that went down. And so I think generally we would have ended up with a little bit lower cost in the second quarter.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Great. That\u2019s pretty good. One question, point of clarification on the Timberlands, the comment was made that export sales to China and Japan are seeing increased competition. Is that increased competition coming from the U.S. or somewhere else?", "Daniel Fulton", "Well, as we looked at it, we saw substantial improvement in all of our volume in going to both China, Japan and Korea in Q2. The comment I was specifically referring to was for China and Korea as other producers are looking for outlets for their volumes compared to the domestic alternative.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And are those other producers in North America? I'm just curious where they're coming from?", "Daniel Fulton", "Those other producers are North America, as well as New Zealand and as well as other producing companies.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So it is more broad than just Doug Fir. Okay.", "Daniel Fulton", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Chip Dillon with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Patty, just so we get this right, I would imagine in the third quarter is when you're going to catch up on the tax rate and will you intend to sort of tell us what portion of the reversal or credit that's almost inevitable? Or maybe it's not a credit, but what portion of the tax line is to catch up from the first half and what portion deals with the third quarter?", "Patrica Bedient", "Well, it will all run through the quarter, Chip, and we can dimension what the catch-up would be versus what it would be on a quarter basis. As you think about just the tax rate differential, we're at about 37%, 38% right now and it's probably going to be something closer to 20% for the year.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And I think if you could give us a little color just as a follow-up on Specialty Fibers, the Pulp business. It was much better than we thought with sort of the hand-hide behind your back of three mills being down. Could you just let us know how much that downtime cost reversal will likely be in the third quarter? And is it sort of fair to say that we should look at, for the most part, the industry pricing that, given your fluff orientation, is substantially higher according to RECE today than it was on average in the second quarter?", "Thomas Gideon", "Chip, this is Tom. Let me take that. The maintenance cost associated with the three outages was approximately $30 million in Q2. So you can factor that into your model. And of course, as you've noted, we have very strong markets in our fluff components, and I would also say that as you look at our MBSK, we are heavily weighted towards premium towel and tissue which has held up reasonably well. And I would also indicate that we have very little transactional exposure to China. So when we put those together, as Patty mentioned, we're looking forward to increased realizations in this segment for Q3.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "If I may on the stock, the way I\u2019m viewing it, and tell me if I'm missing this, is that what trades today basically reflects the market cap above $5.04 billion. And I was wondering if is there anything either an investor can do or the company would do or cares about to sort of reduce the volatility which, of course, it hasn't been that volatile, but you do have this window of time where it's not going to reflect the total market cap, but just the part above $5.04 billion?", "Patrica Bedient", "Well, I think the way to think about the market cap if you were looking at Chart 12, for example, would be to take the total shares that are indicated there of the $517 million and if you took that times the trading price of the stock, so if you used yesterday's stock price, for example, of $16.49, you'd end up with a market cap of I think that's probably somewhere north of $8 billion. So around $8.5 billion. So that's the way really to think about the market cap. As we had talked about on the conference call in July 12, theoretically, the market cap should change by the amount of the cash portion of the dividend. So market cap decrease should be about $560 million.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Totally understand, but the volatility of the market cap will only be expressed between now and September in what trades right now.", "Patrica Bedient", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Larry, I was hoping you could give maybe a little bit more color on where the surprise came from in the quarter. Your guidance was initially, I think, for a loss in the single-family sales. I'm just wondering usually you have a decent amount of lead time in outlook in there so I'm just wondering what changed in the second quarter.", "Larry Burrows", "I think a couple of things happened. We saw mix had to do with a good part of it, and so a little heavier in some of the San Diego, Houston did well to a lesser extent, DC, and then we also had improved margins. And we also got some additional closings and some of that may have had to do with the June, or at least initially the June 30 closing date that was the expectation for customers to be able to qualify for that first-time tax credit.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And do you feel pretty good about the visibility you have for the current quarter right now?", "Larry Burrows", "Well, I think that the markets are, as we said, challenged, but we do feel okay about what the visibility that we have, yes.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And, Tom, just following up on Chip\u2019s question on fluff pulp. I mean, can you talk maybe just the supply-demand dynamics that you're seeing in fluff. And with commodity prices falling, I mean, do you think it would follow that, that fluff would eventually have to follow that?", "Thomas Gideon", "Gail, as you know, it's still a relative overall-type market despite evidence of softening. With the supply disruptions are behind us and of course, China\u2019s being very deliberate in replenishing its inventory. And as you know, they have some new local supply with their new mill at Rizhao which is bleached hardwood craft so those are some factors that are involved. On the other hand, what you have offsetting that is that industry inventories are currently very low. And as I mentioned earlier, we participate in MBSJ primarily in the premium towel and tissue, we have a very strong relationship in fluff with a few key customers who are growing. We have a very strong order file. So while there is some overall price moderation that could put some downward pressure on markets, we feel very good about our order file and about what it looks like for fluff going forward.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Christopher John with Deutsche Bank.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was just wondering about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of log price trends. Wood Products, a lot of volatility with a sharp spike in 2Q and then the drop-out since then. I'm wondering how much the log prices benefited from that on the way up and is going the other way now.", "Daniel Fulton", "Well, Chris, the log prices do have a strong dependency on what happens on the Wood Products markets. If you look year-over-year, we've seen tremendous improvement in our log realizations as Wood Products markets have improved as well. And it is impacted domestically depending on how our customers are doing in terms of their ability to pay for the raw material. So that's another reason why we not only make sure that we do a great job in marketing our material in domestic U.S., but we also maintain great international presence in export markets as well.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, I mean broadly speaking though, how would you compare the amount of volatility in log prices to the amount of volatility, let's say, in lumber?", "Thomas Gideon", "Well I think you see more volatility in lumber than you do in logs. Typically, you'll see logs that will be a little bit lagging in terms of how they respond either up or down to the marketplace conditions. So it's less.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then getting back to the outlook on your Cellulose business, you said that 3Q was going to be strong, but given what's going on in commodities and pulp markets, how do you see that impacting the potential outlook for 4Q?", "Thomas Gideon", "Well again, as I mentioned, we have focused relationships with key customers, both on what I would call market pulp as well as fluff, which is our predominant sales volume. We have limited exposure in what I\u2019ll call true commodity-type pulp and so we're not quite impacted as well as others might be by what's going on in China and elsewhere.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Just first a couple of questions on Wood Products. Trying to get a sense as to was there any impact from inventory losses perhaps in your Distribution business as prices were falling down rapidly and maybe as a part of that, you\u2019d mentioned that Engineered Wood and Distribution were particularly challenging. Can you give us a sense as to how big an impact that might have been? Because one thing I just compared your profitability in building products versus that of everybody else who\u2019s got a building products business and you didn\u2019t stack up very well in the quarter. And I\u2019m sure you look at that as well so maybe if you could provide a little color as to why that was and what you can do to change that.", "Daniel Fulton", "Sure. And actually, when we look at lumbers and panels, both in the market as well as with us, we did well in Q2. We were extremely encouraged by our performance of our Panel segment this quarter. With the improved commodity prices, we had a good boost to performance in those markets, and it went well. Our Lumber segment also performed well despite having rapidly falling products as I mentioned from mid-May to the end of June. And we did take some downtime, which impacted our costs so that we were positioning our inventories for what we see as a reduced market outlook in the third quarter. Now as you mentioned, both Engineered and Distributions continue to be challenged. These are segments that are very strongly tied to housing starts and order files from dealers. And it's going to be difficult to see significant performance in those segments until we start to see some sustained recovery in housing starts. I would also note that we do have significant operations that have been curtailed and closed in that segment and not all of the costs associated with those have gone away. However, that does provide significant potential leverage as markets recover. And to your first point, is yes, distribution does get impacted by the timing and the severity of price changes in this kind of a rapid fashion.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "I realize you're not going to want to get too granular. But if I look at Louisiana Pacific or Norbord, their panel businesses, they were kind of order of magnitude 25% margins. If you look at the lumber players, there was some range, but they were basically kind of 5% to 15% in terms of margins in the second quarter. When you said you were doing well in those businesses, were you comparable to that or were you -- because if you were, then there must have been very sizable losses in the Engineered Wood and the Distribution businesses.", "Thomas Gideon", "Well, as you know, each company has a unique portfolio and geographic presence that contributes to their results. In Panels, I think we were fairly comparable. In Lumber, we did well but again, depending on the structure and where the geographic presence are or where the lumber producers, we could be impacted. As you would note, Canadian lumber did well. SBF, a little bit reduced in South and the West where we have our major presence. So we did well given our market presence and where we\u2019re located.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And then lastly, different line of inquiry, harvest. In the Analyst Meeting earlier this year, you provided an assessment of potential harvest levels. I think it\u2019s like 13.5 units this year and going up to perhaps 16.5 next year if I just look at that chart, what type of housing -- how dependent is that on housing start levels and give us a sense of what type of housing start levels that might have embedded.", "Daniel Fulton", "Well Mark, as I look back, I think you're referring to we indicated we\u2019d be about 13 million cubic meters of harvest in this year. We\u2019re on track for that. The other one was a potential outlook that could occur, which was based on trend. We don't forecast out exact housing starts going forward. But they certainly have to be higher than where they are today.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Patty, can you just confirm that the cost basis for legacy shareholders is, in fact, bifurcated with the legacy shares at the higher basis? And then the new shares at the lower basis. And I guess on a related point, I don't know if you can weigh in on this, but do you have a view on whether wash sale rules will be triggered for shareholders with the IRS?", "Patrica Bedient", "Well, I think I'll speak to the cost basis of the shares, both pre-and post dividend. In terms of the historical shares, so shares that people owned before the dividend, those shares will retain their basis that they have, there's no change. So if you own shares that you had a $50 basis in, those same shares will have a $50 basis after the special dividend issuance of stock. Now the new shares that we issue for the special dividend will have a full cost basis at the valuation at which we issue them. So if you were to look at Chart 12 then, the new shares, the 305 million new shares that would be issued, would have a cost basis of $16.49. So in our example before, your old shares would have a much higher basis than the new shares that you would get.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And correct me if I'm wrong, but it\u2019s the discretion in the shareholder to which shares they would ultimately sell to apply in their portfolio to book a gain or a capital loss.", "Patrica Bedient", "Yes, I think there are a number of ways that -- options that shareholders have, individual shareholders, could look at their, depending upon what method they use, if they use an average method when they sell shares, of course, they\u2019d have an average. But you can use a specific identification method, so you could choose to sell the shares that you had in your portfolio before the new dividend shares. And those shares will likely have a much higher basis than the new issued shares. So you would have a capital loss in that respect if you had held them for the holding period.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And again, without being too technical here, do you have a view, Patty, on whether the wash sale rules would be triggered with the IRS on the capital losses?", "Patrica Bedient", "I really wouldn't want to give individual or corporate tax advice for\u2026", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Fair enough. You mentioned that the cash balance is $1.8 billion in the quarter. What do you view as the optimal cash balance going forward?", "Patrica Bedient", "Well that's a really good question, Pete. Because it really depends, in terms of what your view of the outlook is from a economic climate perspective. Historically, ourselves and probably most others in this industry and others wouldn't carry the amount of cash that they have on their balance sheets today, but the uncertainty in the economic environment certainly has led us to carry a higher cash balance. The other piece that comes into play would be what debt maturities are. And as you know, we did retire just about half of the 2012 debt maturity tower, but we still have just over $500 billion of that in 2012 as well as just under $200 million of RECO debt. So I think as we go forward, as we look at the $1.8 billion, we have some reduction in our gross debt. We also have $560 million of cash of a special dividend that we\u2019ll be issuing in the quarter as well. So we\u2019re balancing all of those pieces in our outlook for cash. In addition, to the renegotiation of our $1 billion line of credit that we have today, that expires at the end of 2011. So I think your cash balance is just a mix of all of those factors, but clearly the amount of cash at $1.8 billion on a go-forward basis would be higher than we normally would have.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Tom, can you remind us what the headcount is in the Wood Products business? I know it's come down, but can you remind us what it is today? And if you were to look for housing starts to potentially be in a $1 million or even a sub-$1 million level for an extended period, can you comment on the fixed cost footprint do you have in that business? And whether you think you\u2019re competitive enough?", "Thomas Gideon", "Sure. Headcount, we're approximately, I believe, about 6,700 in Wood Products, which as you know is down substantially from what it has been. At its peak it was closer to 14,000. In terms of sub-$1 million, as we\u2019ve looked, again, profitability is going to be a combination of price and volume as we go forward. We saw April and May be very profitable months for us even [indiscernible 1:02:43] sub-$1 million housing starts. So as we look forward and we get closer to $1 million, we do have the cost structure that will allow us to do well. But again, you need some level of reasonable pricing along with increased demand in order to make that a fact. So as you know, we've worked very hard over the last year to reduce our cost structure. We're not finished yet. It's a never-ending battle, and we're going to continue to improve our margins by looking for ways to not only improve our sales, but also to reduce our operating cost.", "Operator", "The next question will come from John Tumazos.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, it's actually Joseph Ferrata [ph 1:03:25]. A quick question on the pulp. A couple of local producers announced price cuts starting August 1, and I was wondering if you guys expect to see similar situations where you guys cut back and end up with a slightly higher than last quarter average price as opposed to a significantly higher?", "Daniel Fulton", "Well, John (sic), again I\u2019ll just go back and mention we don't talk about price action up or down. And I would just say going back is we have a very strong order file, we\u2019re well positioned in the markets in which we serve with our growing set of customers, and as Patty mentioned in the outlook, we\u2019re going to see stronger realizations. And we see strong positioning for ourselves where we are in MBSK and, of course, we\u2019re very strong in the fluff market, which remains strong and very tight inventories and good demand. So we feel good about where we're going to be in third quarter.", "Operator", "And the final question will come from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "This question\u2019s for Dan. Dan, as you've now made the decision to convert to a REIT, will there be any significant changes in your strategy across either each of the businesses, either from an operating standpoint or how you look at the portfolio longer-term for Weyerhaeuser?", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks, Rick. Our core asset is our Timberlands, and we\u2019re focused on growing Timberlands\u2019 earnings, and the REIT structure supports that strategy. Our other businesses, which are held in the TRS are positioned to benefit from the recovery as we\u2019ve talked about before, and they will generate cash flow. That cash flow will then be available to us to service our debt, to supplement our dividend and to position us for future growth, all to the benefit of our shareholders. So as we look at the portfolio, each piece has a place. And I want to focus on the fact that the core asset is our Timberlands. You know we've got over 6 million acres of some of the most valuable, sustainably-managed timberland in the world, and we're focused on growing the earnings from that segment. We believe strongly that the shift to the REIT structure will significantly enhance the opportunities that we have for Timberlands both in day-to-day operations but also in our ability to grow that asset.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Daniel Fulton", "Let me just, as we close the call, I\u2019d like to summarize key themes for the second quarter and some of the themes that we\u2019ve talked about as we enter the third quarter. When we entered the second quarter, we had positive momentum in all of our businesses. Our Wood Products, Real Estate and Timberlands businesses capitalized on improved conditions early in the quarter. But then as we\u2019ve spoken this morning, faced challenging conditions after the housing tax credit expired at the end of April. We reacted quickly to the slowdown in housing and effectively managed our operations through this uncertain climate, and I'm encouraged by our profitability for the quarter and the significant improvement over prior periods. As we enter the third quarter, housing activity remains at near record lows. Recovery trajectory continues to be uncertain, and Wood Products prices are back to levels seen at the beginning of the year. Business conditions in our Cellulose Fibers business continued to improve through the end of the second quarter and our earnings reflected the resulting increase in prices and with no planned maintenance in the third quarter, we're now able to return to full production and take advantage of current market conditions. As our business teams focused on improved business operations, we made great progress in moving to a REIT structure by declaring our special dividend to pay out earnings and profits. Our focus now is on completing the conversion with payment of the special dividend on September 1. And so in summary, as I look back on the quarter, we made good progress on three important fronts: Operating earnings, cash flow and REIT conversion. For everybody on the call this morning, we appreciate your attention. And we look forward to continued dialogue and your involvement, and as usual, Kathy McAuley will be available later today to help with any further questions or comments.

Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I am Kathy McCauley, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com.

Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this call.", "Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Today, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $1,116,000,000 for the third quarter or $3.50 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. This compares with essentially break-even results on net sales of $1.4 billion for the same period last year. In the second quarter of 2010, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $14 million or $0.07 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion.", "Earnings for the third quarter included $1,035,000,000 from income tax adjustments primarily related to the reversal of deferred taxes as a result of Weyerhaeuser's conversion to a REIT. Excluding the income tax adjustment, Weyerhaeuser reported Q3 net earnings of $81 million or $0.25 per diluted share, a $137 million increase compared with last year's third quarter.", "On our website, we provided an earnings information package, which includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items. You will notice that we had added new information to this package. We hope you find this information useful. We begin our discussion this morning with a review of Chart 4, the waterfall chart in the earnings information package. A discussion of each business covering Charts 5 to 10  will then follow.", "Turning to Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment. Weyerhaeuser's segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 to the third quarter were as follows beginning with the first bar on the left-hand side of the page. In the second quarter, Weyerhaeuser earned $168 million before special items, interest and taxes. Timberlands ended Q3 with earnings $5 million higher than in Q2. Wood Products earnings were $89 million lower than in the second quarter. Cellulose Fibers contributed $107 million more to earnings in the third quarter. Earnings from Real Estate were $7 million lower than second quarter, and Corporate & Other contributed $2 million more in Q3.  The final bar to the right of the page is Weyerhaeuser's third quarter earnings of $186 million before special items, interest and taxes.", "Turning next to the business segments, we begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. Timberlands contributed $75 million to pretax earnings in Q3, $5 million more than in Q2. The Q3 disposition of non-strategic Timberlands was $34 million pretax compared to $14 million pretax in Q2. This increase was partially offset by lower log price realizations as illustrated on Chart 6. Log prices in the West declined 7%. Export sales realizations were down 5% due to mix. Log prices in the South were flat.", "Chart 6 shows fee harvest volumes in the West and South. The fee harvest was seasonally stronger in the third quarter. Western harvest volume rose a modest 3%. Southern volume increased 10%. Year-to-date, the Western harvest is down 18%, and the South is down 15% from last year. Harvest deferrals continue. Spending for road and silviculture was seasonally higher, silviculture spending including a catch-up from activities deferred as a result of poor weather earlier this year.", "Turning next to Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Market conditions rapidly deteriorated at the end of second quarter and difficult markets persisted in Q3. Wood Products lost $100 million, $89 million worth in the Q2 lost before special items of $11 million. As indicated on Chart 8, lumber prices declined 18% or $61 per thousand board feet and OSB prices plummeted 30% or $81 per thousand square feet. Engineered Wood Products prices increased slightly, but engineered I-joist shipments fell 24%. The Wood Products business reduced working capital by $54 million during Q3 and ended the quarter at cash breakeven.", "Turning to Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. In third quarter, Cellulose Fibers on a pretax basis earned $181 million, contributing $107 million more to earnings than in second quarter. During the quarter, pulp prices reached a 15-year peak. Pulp price realizations increased by $70 per ton, 8% higher than in Q2. Pulp sales volumes increased 8% in the quarter. There were no maintenance outages in Q3, resulting in $30 million less of maintenance spending and an improvement in productivity. There had been three maintenance outages in the second quarter.", "Real Estate, Chart 10. In third quarter, Real Estate contributed $20 million to pretax earnings, including income from partnerships. This contribution from Real Estate was $7 million lower in the third quarter from the second quarter. The volume of single-family homes closed declined 20% from 625 closings to 501 closing. However, due to mix, average prices improved 8% and gross margins modestly increased. Land and lot sales were fewer in the quarter. Land and lots sales were $4 million in Q3 versus $13 million in Q2. The backlog of homes sold but not closed declined in the quarter and stands at 660 units. The cancellation rate edged down 20% from 22%. I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy, and good morning to everyone who is joining us today. I'm pleased to provide my comments this morning on the quarterly results, as well as a review of current market conditions. We have some good news to share regarding the record performance of our Cellulose Fibers business and the ability of our Real Estate business to produce its third consecutive profitable quarter in a very weak market. However, we continue to face challenging market conditions for Wood Products, which requires our continued focus on improving the performance of this business.", "Before I comment on market conditions and our financial performance, I want to talk about the management changes we announced on October 1. Leadership is a critical element of business success. The changes I've recently made will accelerate our rate of improvement in our overall competitiveness. First, I've eliminated the role of Executive Vice President for Forest Products and the leaders of each of our four major business segments now report directly to me, increasing my direct involvement in our operations. Our most important asset is our Timberlands, and that's why I've placed Tom Gideon in our Timberlands lead role. Tom has deep experience in Timberlands management having previously led the business. I expect Tom to apply his broad set of experiences to managing our core Timberlands assets and our new structure for the benefit of our shareholders.", "Wood Products has been our greatest challenge during the housing recession, and I have asked Larry Burrows to lead this business. Larry has been leading our Real Estate business since April of 2008. The last three years have been the most challenging period WRECO has ever experienced. During this difficult time, Larry provided strong leadership as WRECO repositioned land and product, reduce construction costs and significantly reduced SG&A. These changes in strong local leadership resulted in WRECO returning to profitability this year, outperforming much of the industry. I expect Larry to apply his strong operating skills, his intimate knowledge of the housing market and the homebuilding industry to improve profitability in our Wood Products segment. With Larry moving to the Wood Products business, I've chosen Peter Orser to lead WRECO. Peter, most recently, has been the President of WRECO's Puget Sound base subsidiary, Quadrant Homes. Under Peter's leadership, Quadrant became the largest homebuilder in the Pacific Northwest through its focus on manufacturing efficiency and profitably serving the needs of entry-level buyers.", "Our Cellulose Fibers business segment continues to be ably led by Shaker Chandrasekaran. As an introduction to the market conditions affecting our company, I remind you that three of our major businesses, Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate, continue to be impacted by conditions in the U.S. housing market, which are very challenging. We commented in this morning's release that the direction of the housing market remains uncertain.", "On our second quarter call, we noted that the improved momentum that began last year and carried through the first quarter suddenly turned to negative following the expiration of the housing tax credit at the end of April. These negative housing trends continue as evidenced by our own third quarter performance metrics compared with the third quarter one year ago.", "In WRECO, our quarterly new home sales declined 30%. In our Wood Products business, sales of our TJI joists, which primarily are used in new construction, decreased 28%. And in our Timberlands business, combined external and internal domestic log sales volume was 9% lower with export volumes helping to partially cushion the full impact of the drop in domestic demand.", "Housing fundamentals remain weak as we enter the final quarter of the year when construction activity is normally lower. This is a result of the lack of job recovery, low consumer confidence, stagnant home prices, the overhang of known and shadow inventory and this week's front page story, the growing uncertainty related to home foreclosures.", "New single-family starts for September were 452,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, a slight improvement from the low levels in the summer, but unfortunately well below the 600,000 level that we assumed as we entered 2010. So let's discuss how these housing dynamics played out for us in the third quarter.", "Starting with our biggest challenge, Wood Products. We expected a significantly larger loss in the third quarter as compared with the second quarter because of rapidly deteriorating prices. Unfortunately, this is how the quarter played out. Comparing quarter-over-quarter segment results for Wood Products, 90% of the decrease in contribution was the result of price decline with lumber and OSB realizations dropping significantly from their second quarter peaks.  On balance, quarter-over-quarter sales volume also suffered somewhat with lumber and OSB volumes roughly flat, while engineered wood product volumes were dramatically reduced. Despite these headwinds in the U.S, our three Canadian lumber mills ran at over 90% of capacity during the quarter, performing well, aided by lower lot costs, good operating metrics and improved export sales. Timing and pace of housing recovery are still not evident, so we continue to match our production capacity with demand.", "During the quarter, we closed our Albany, Oregon engineered lumber mill. We reduced the size of our sales and marketing staff by consolidating sales regions. We're dealing with cost for a number of closed and underutilized Wood Products facilities, especially in our OSB and Engineered Wood Products businesses. Currently, 30% of our total OSB capacity is indefinitely curtailed. 19% of our I-joist capacity and 45% of our engineered solid section capacity is shut down. Even with this level of indefinitely closed facilities, operating rates at the remaining mills were low. And given the slow pace of housing recovery, we will be taking further action in the fourth quarter.", "In our Timberlands business, as a result of continued softness in housing demand, we continue to defer harvest in both the West and the South in order to optimize longer-term values. Year-to-date, harvest volumes in both regions are down approximately 16%, and compared with 2008, they're down 42%. Looking forward as supply becomes constrained and demand and prices improve, we have the ability to increase our harvest.", "In addition to revenues from logs sales and energy and minerals related income from our lands, we continue to see potential to generate additional revenues in the future as markets develop for biomass once we have some clarity around U.S. climate and energy policies.", "Our Real Estate segment was one of the bright spots in the quarter. Though we expected break-even results, we turned a profit for the third consecutive quarter. Closings were lower quarter-over-quarter, while average prices increased due to mix and we remained profitable. Margins were slightly higher, the result of our continued actions, which include repositioning product and managing costs. Activity across our WRECO markets is mixed. California's inland Empire, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas markets are operating at low rates and are extremely competitive. After outperforming the country for the last couple of years, Houston has started to move downward. And in the Puget Sound area, most communities are slow with the exception of those located near military installations.", "On the positive side, in San Diego and the Washington DC suburbs, activities is relatively strong. Winchester's Poplar Run project in Silver Spring, Maryland, just opened its new models two weekends ago, attracting over 1,000 shoppers, evidence that there is still a market for well designed homes in an attractive community where employment is improving.", "I'll complete my remarks in business performance with the discussion of our one segment that is not tied to the U.S. housing market, and that's Cellulose Fibers. This business is affected by global macroeconomic conditions, foreign exchange rates and the strength of demand for our differentiated Cellulose Fibers products, especially absorbent fluff pulp from the U.S. South. We expected earnings from this sector to be substantially higher than the second quarter, and as reported in our release this morning, Cellulose Fibers turned in a record performance for the quarter due to higher prices, lower maintenance cost and strong operating performance by all of our mills. Our key customers are all growing, especially in emerging global markets, and they acknowledge their reliance in our  product to meet their growth opportunities.", "In addition to the record performance in our pulp mills, segment earnings were enhanced by continued strong profitability from our Liquid Packaging business. We certainly benefited from continued pulp price improvement over the past six quarters, and we've have coupled that with steady improvements in safe, reliable operations across the entire business system, manufacturing, as well as sales. I want to recognize Shaker and his team for this record performance.", "Before turning the call over to Patty, I want to comment on one other significant accomplishment during the quarter. Though it may already seem to be old news, I'm pleased to report that our special dividend payment was completed on September 1. Our conversion to a REIT structure supports our strategy to enhance the competitiveness of our core Timberlands business, increasing cash flow available for distribution to our shareholders. This transaction was unprecedented in terms of size and complexity given the historic nature of our Timberlands assets, and I want to thank the entire Weyerhaeuser team who managed the process to a successful conclusion. I'm looking forward to sharing our ongoing dividend decision in December following action by our board.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call to Patty, who will provide fourth quarter outlook and financial comments. Patty?", "Patricia Bedient", "Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. I'll start the outlook with Timberlands, and my comments are summarized on Chart 11.", "In the West, our export and domestic log volumes and realizations are expected to decrease in the fourth quarter compared to the third. In the South, great log realizations are projected to be flat to slightly lower compared to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes in both the west and south are scheduled to declined seasonally. Costs should includes increase slightly, as a result of catching up on some cultural spending in the South.", "Excluding the effects of non-strategic land sales, earnings in our Timberlands segment are anticipated to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third. Wood Products average sales realizations and sales volumes will likely decrease across all our major product lines in the fourth quarter. Log costs are expected to decrease somewhat, which will offset some of the decline in revenue. The seasonally slow nature of the fourth quarter combined with lackluster housing demand will likely lead to increased downtime as we match production with demand.", "In addition, we are reviewing our capacity plan across the system, including operations that are now indefinitely curtailed. As a result of this review, we may make decisions that could lead to additional impairments to facilities in the fourth quarter. Before the effect of any impairment, we anticipate the fourth quarter loss to be comparable to the third quarter.", "In Cellulose Fibers, we expect average sales realizations to soften somewhat compared to the third quarter, although demand continues to be strong. We have a short scheduled annual maintenance shutdown at one of our facilities, so we will incur increased maintenance and somewhat lower production relative to the third quarter when we had no maintenance shutdown.  Overall, we anticipate fourth quarter earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment to be very strong although lower than the record earnings of the third quarter.", "Dan has already described the challenging market conditions facing our Real Estate business. Traditionally, the fourth quarter is the strongest quarter of the year for home closings. While we do expect to close approximately 100 more homes in Q4 compared to Q3, the number will likely be fewer than the 625 homes closed during Q2, which was aided by the housing tax credit. We expect margins to moderate somewhat in the fourth quarter compared to the third, and we don't anticipate any significant land or lot sales in the fourth quarter.", "Overall, earnings in our Real Estate segment are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third. In addition, our backlog will likely decline during the fourth quarter from the already low level of 660 homes at the end of the third quarter.", "As Dan mentioned, I will review some of the changes to the third quarter as a result of our special dividend and our conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust or REIT structure.", "On September 1, we made a special distribution to our shareholders. This distribution accomplished the payout of our accumulated earnings and profits, which was the last critical milestone to enable our conversion to a REIT. This payout was made by distributing $560 million of cash and approximately 324 million new shares. To help you understand the reporting implications of the dividend, we have included a couple of additional charts in the packet.", "Chart 12 lays out the reconciliation of the changes in our share count as of the end of the third quarter, as well as the computation of the weighted average shares outstanding used for the calculation of our earnings per share. Accounting rules don't allow for retroactive restatement of the historical EPS for the new shares issued in the dividend.", "On Chart 13, we have provided the pro forma EPS as if the shares issued in the special dividend had been outstanding for all of the periods presented. Looking forward, we anticipate using approximately 537 million shares for the EPS calculation in the fourth quarter.", "As a result of REIT conversion, we also made a number of tax adjustments in the third quarter. These are illustrated on chart 14. Our effective tax rate for the year is estimated to be approximately 18.5%. Applying this rate to our third quarter earnings before taxes of $91 million, we have a tax provision of $17 million for the third quarter. The year-to-date benefit from the true up of the tax rate for the first and second quarters is approximately $7 million.", "We also have an adjustment during the quarter for the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with our book [ph] tax basis difference in our Timberlands of approximately $1,043,000,000 and the charge of $8 million primarily as a result of Medicare Part D plan changes. These adjustments net to the $1,025,000,000 benefit as shown as our third quarter tax benefit.", "While we're on the topic of taxes, I'd like to comment on the effect of the recent IRS clarification regarding the cellulosic biofuel producers tax credit. Earlier this year, the IRS released a memo, which allows black liquor to qualify for this credit once companies are registered with the IRS. We received our registration in the third quarter. On October 5 of this year, the IRS provided guidance allowing black liquor to qualify for both the biofuel producers tax credit and the alternative fuel mixture credit in the same year, but not on the same gallons of fuel.", "During 2009, we produced 238 million gallons of black liquor, which did not qualify for the alternative fuel mixture credit. This equals approximately $240 million of potential cellulosic biofuel credit at $1.1 per gallon or $149 million net of tax. We anticipate recognizing this quarter in the fourth quarter. Since this credit offsets income tax liability, we will carry the credit forward.", "At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $1,370,000,000 in cash. This is a decrease of approximately $480 million from the end of the second quarter, primarily as a result of the special dividend of $560 million. We have included a full cash flow statement in the materials that we released this morning.", "Capital expenditures for Weyerhaeuser Co. for the first three quarters of this year are just under $150 million. For the full year, we expect net capital expenditures to be just over $200 million. We continue to have strong liquidity with minimal near-term debt maturities and no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion line of credit. Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. Given the weakness we're seeing in today's housing market, we will continue to take aggressive actions across the company to reduce costs and improve profitability. In WRECO, we'll continue to adjust product offerings. We'll adjust pricing as dictated by market competition. We'll continue to seek opportunities to reduce construction and operating costs, and we'll continue to review and adjust our land and lot positions as necessary.", "In Timberlands, we'll continue to seek opportunities to increase revenues by leveraging our experience in relationships and export markets. We'll carefully manage costs, adjust harvest levels and exploit revenue opportunities from our mineral rights, as well as emerging markets for biomass.", "In our Wood Products business, we're committed to improving profitability at today's level of housing starts. We need to improve margins using all available levers by enhancing revenues, reducing operating costs and adjusting capacity.", "In our Cellulose Fibers business, we'll continue to focus on operational improvements as we serve the needs of our key customers as they take advantage of global growth, especially in emerging markets.", "In sum, we're committed to improving our performance in today's level of demand. And with our scale, we'll be prepared to take advantage of an economic recovery when it comes.", "And now I'd like to ask Kathy to open the call to your questions.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Thanks, Dan. Nicole, could you please give instructions for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "I wanted to ask on your fee harvest for 2010, roughly how much would you characterize to be sawtimber versus pulpwood? And how does that compare to a more normalized harvest?", "Daniel Fulton", "Sawtimber in the West is roughly 90%, Pete, and 65% in the South. There's been a bit of a shift towards fiber, especially in the south, but no significant change beyond that.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And, Dan, on your mineral rights strategy, can you remind us how you're thinking about the strategy for the business? And what kind of earnings or cash flow have you been generating in that business and how do you think about it going forward?", "Daniel Fulton", "We have approximately 7 million acres of mineral rights. So we have mineral rights on land that we own, as well as land that we have sold in the past where we've retained the mineral rights. The way we manage that is that we have our own minerals group. We are generally entering into operating leases with those that are exploring and exploiting the resource, whether it's gravel, oil or gas. Those would be the primary resource that have come off of our land. Generally, those leases are entered into, we receive an upfront lease payment that ends up being amortized over a period of time, and then we have the ability to collect royalties if they are successful. Over the last several years, our minerals earnings have been running roughly in the $50 million a year range. In the quarter just completed, minerals earnings were just a shade under $15 million. The opportunities that we have are to continue to exploit the resources that we have on the lands that we have under our control. In addition to the existing materials, we also have that group managing some of the newer resource, which would include wind and geothermal energy. The most significant resource that we have in the minerals group is in Louisiana, where we have land as part of the Haynesville shale play, and though prices are down a bit of natural gas, we continue to generate good earnings and the operators that are operating under the leases seem to be having some success. So we're optimistic about being able to maintain and grow that over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Dan, can you give me a little bit more color on the Timberlands you sold in the first quarter? Is that sort of the 88,000 you've been marketing in the west?", "Daniel Fulton", "It is not 88,000 that we have been marketing, Gail. We had several sales during the quarter, the most significant was a property that we call Copper Creek, which is located in the Western Oregon region. That was a sale of about 12,500 acres. It was non-strategic for our purposes, roughly 65% doug fir, 35% hemlock. It was lower value land in terms of what we would like to see long-term in our portfolio, and it was sold at a price that we felt was very competitive. With respect to the property you referred to, what we call for LeBeau, which is the 80,000 plus acres that we have been marketing on west coast of Washington, we have had a wide variety of interest from, quite frankly, wide range of buyer tights. We are in active discussions, and we are optimistic that we may be seeing values that would cause us to transact that sale, although I wouldn't expect anything to happen until early 2011.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Can you give a quick update on assets sales outside of Timberland? I guess Cosmopolis, an update on the railroads and any other assets that could be on the market?", "Daniel Fulton", "Sure. As you noted, we did sell Cosmopolis. That's a dissolving pulp facility that has been shut down for a number of years. We found a good buyer, and we are pleased that they're going to be able to reopen that facility and create some employment in a town that really needs it. We do have a transaction on our railroads that we are in the midst of. It's subject to federal approval, and we hope to receive that approval before year end. In addition to those, we've have a number of non-strategic assets that we identified overtime, that we seek opportunities to monetize. We are engaged in some discussions at this point evaluating strategic alternatives for our Hardwoods business, which is a small niche business that reports up to our Wood Products segment. But that's just the process that we're going through right now in evaluating alternatives.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "In terms of the Wood Products business. Can you talk a little bit more about what you can do there? Is this all about just shrinking the footprint or do you think there are other things that you can do to improve results?", "Daniel Fulton", "Improving the results in our Wood Products business is our highest internal priority right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are looking at all levers that we have. Improving revenues, reducing operating costs, both in the mills, as well as SG&A, and then we are taking a very hard look at our capacity. As I mentioned in my remarks, we already have a significant amount of capacity that's indefinitely curtailed, but of those mills that are still operating, they're operating at generally low levels. And so you should expect to see some activity in the fourth quarter related to capacity, which would position us to be more profitable in the current market because even for these facilities that are shut down, there's operating costs associated with just maintaining them for security purposes and maintaining the equipment. So it's a full-court press in that business, and I'm confident that Larry Burrows taking a fresh look at it and taking a very strong hand off on Tom Gideon will produce some results.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Chun with Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just following up on the last question regarding Wood Products, can you talk a little bit more about what the magnitude of that cost cutting opportunities might be and what kind of year-over-year improvements we might see if markets fail to improve next year?", "Daniel Fulton", "I can't give you specifics, Chris. We have, over the last two years, been focused on this business. We've taken out a lot of manufacturing costs. As I mentioned, we have indefinitely curtailed a significant number of facilities. But at today's anemic level of housing starts, we still have too much capacity. As we enter this year, early in the year you may recall that we were anticipating single-family starts at a level of about 600,000. We're falling well below that. As we move towards 2011, we commented this morning as we talked about WRECO that WRECO is entering 2011 with a low backlog. I think WRECO is representative of other large homebuilders in the U.S. I would expect that the entire homebuilding community will be moving into 2011 with a lower backlog than they entered 2010 with. And so given the nature of low level of backlog at the beginning of the year, we're anticipating that 2011 will be another very challenging year, and so we are sizing our activities to address today's level of demand and not counting on that improvement in 2010. I would say that's a significant change year-over-year in the way we were looking at that business. We had anticipated recovery. We started to see it in the first quarter. It collapsed after the end of April. We believe long-term that single-family housing starts will return to trend levels, but it is going to be a slow climb out of where we are today. And so we are addressing that in Wood Products business.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank AG", "Are you operating under the assumption that we're going to have another 600,000 type year next year or do you see at least modest improvement at this point?", "Daniel Fulton", "We don't have a forecast yet for next year. We generate our own forecast, but we look at that of others. We'll share that later in the year when we have another opportunity as we get closer to 2011. We are planning for flat activity year-over-year and hope to be pleasantly surprised with recovery.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then, Patty, can you tell us about what percentage of Timberlands earnings are REIT-qualifying earnings?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, if you think about our Timberlands earnings, probably the way to think about it is what we generated so far from the first three quarters. So I think our overall Timberlands segment earnings are about $225 million for the first nine months, and our qualified earnings are just over $70-ish million. So how do you get from that number to the $70 million? You first have to back out the non-strategic plan sales, which are about $80 million for the first three quarters. And then you would also have to back out the mineral income, which is down in the TRS, which Dan just mentioned is about $15 million a quarter. So that would be $45 million a share today. And then we do have some additional SG&A that we do have to charge to the REIT restructure, which is about $10 million to $50 million a quarter. So let's call that a $10 million a quarter, so that would be $30 million. So if you back out, take the $225 million, back out the $80 million, back out the $45 million, back out the $30 million, you'll get around to the $70 million number.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank AG", "You mentioned that 2010 CapEx is looking like just over $200 million. Do you view that as a sustainable level or should we expect that to go up in the coming year?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, it will probably go up modestly in 2011. We haven't set those numbers as we sit here today, but I would say that somewhere in the $200 million, $250-ish million range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Credit Suisse.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Looking at the results, I was actually quite surprised and encouraged by how strong the Cellulose segment came in. It seemed to be a lot better than I think we were looking for, although maybe I missed a black liquor credit or something in there. Was 180 the actual number?", "Daniel Fulton", "No, there was...", "Patricia Bedient", "That number doesn't have any black liquor credit in it, Chip. That segment performed very well during the quarter. All the mills ran very well. We didn't have as we have said any maintenance downtime, but we took no black liquor credit for that segment in the third quarter. And you might recall that last year, of course, we did have black liquor in the third quarter. And if you compare year-over-year even with black liquor in the earnings for last year, the earnings this year are greater than a year ago third quarter.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And as you think about looking ahead, you've seen Proctor and Gamble come out with a very thin diaper that might now finally be getting some traction, the Dry Max. And, of course, that diaper doesn't include hardly any if any fluff pulp. And as you think about that business, which has been very strong, are you concerned about a further thinning of the diapers, if you  will, across the marketplace where fluff pulp might not be used in that product? And obviously, there are some offsets I guess with adult incontinence and other products. But how do you -- any early read on how you see the demand side there for fluff?", "Patricia Bedient", "Chip, I would say that we work very closely with P&G as one of our largest customers. And as we look at their demand, and the demand for fluff overall, it continues to be a very growing market. And not only just a strong market this year, but as we look forward in demand. So I think we are very pleased with the outlook that we hear from P&G, as well as our other customers in that business.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Did you have a view sort of how we should roughly look at the maintenance schedules? Since, I know, it can make the numbers kind of lumpy in this segment. As we look out at the fourth quarter and maybe the first or through the fourth quarters of 2011, sort of when will you take a lot of maintenance and when will you take a little, and I guess the third, you don't take any at all?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, those maintenance shots are scheduled on an annual basis. And this year, we had two in the first quarter, three in the second quarter, none in the third, and as I mentioned, we have one now in the fourth. We plan those annual maintenance around when we need to do things like boiler inspections or put in additional capital plans. So we have not set that schedule and communicated the schedule for 2011. But I wouldn't see that it wouldn't  be terribly different from what you saw in 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Just a little bit more on the Cellulose Fibers business. You gave us the pricing being up $70, and I think you had indicated that the maintenance downtime had been about $30 million in the second quarter. So if I add those, the impact from those two, I get somewhere between $65 million and $70 million of improvements, and you got $107 million. Is that all from the mills just running better, which would then kind of be the question of was the third quarter truly exceptional or were the mills just not really running as well  perhaps that they could have been in prior quarters?", "Daniel Fulton", "I think the primary difference quarter-over-quarter, Mark, is the lack of maintenance downtime. These mills have been running well, and so third quarter happened to be a time when we didn't have any  scheduled shutdowns. They all ran full. And as you know, we got the benefit of price improvements. So it was an across the board accomplishment of just great operations.", "Patricia Bedient", "I think also, Mark, the $30 million that Kathy gave you for the quarter is maintenance spend. And it doesn't account for the fact of the downtime that happened in the second quarter.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Do you have a sense as to how much the downtime costs? And perhaps another way to come at it, it seems like you -- would it be fair to say you roughly took half your annual maintenance downtime in the second quarter? And so roughly how much is full year annual maintenance expense last downtime? How much does that cost the company typically in a given year?", "Daniel Fulton", "I think your assumption about roughly half in the second quarter is correct. As Patty said, we had downtime in the two mills in the first quarter, three in the second quarter. We got one coming up in the fourth quarter. I don't have the numbers that you're asking for, specifically, but we can get back to you.", "Patricia Bedient", "Some other things in the quarter, Mark, was we had somewhat lower fiber costs, lower chemical costs, and, as I've said, the productivity impact from just not having those mills down were really the primary reason for the improved performance of third over second quarter.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "And just switching gears to building products. With prices having been falling during the quarter, I imagine that makes it very difficult for the Distribution business because effectively, they're chasing the price down. Were there significant losses in building products distribution be tied to that?", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes, that's part of the overall loss. You're right. We have a Distribution business that primarily services our Engineered Wood Products and OSB. So as products flow through that system, as prices are moving as quickly as they have been, we incur additional loss. Plus there's some loss in that business that is associated with low utilization. At the level of activity that we're at today, not only do we have underutilized manufacturing facilities, but our distribution system is underutilized. And all of that increases your operating cost.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Pension contributions year-to-date, I think we're running about $190 million. So that's roughly $60 million, a little bit more than that up for the quarter. Is that kind of a decent number on a go-forward or do you expect that's going to change significantly in the year ahead?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure, Mark. As you think about our pension plans, the largest plans are in the U.S., but we do have a number of Canadian plans, as well. As you look at the U.S. plans, we don't expect to have to make any contributions to those in 2011. The Canadian plans don't all have annual valuations. Some of them are done on a tri-annual basis. We do have a larger number of them that will need valuation this year, and we will likely need to make contribution to the Canadian plan in 2011. We would expect that when we add them all together. And we are doing those valuations beginning that process as we speak. So I don't have exact numbers for you, but I would expect that that could be up to $100 million for all the Canadian plans, but nothing anticipated for the U.S. plans.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Dan, maybe just on the Wood Products business for a moment. You talked about some closures in the fourth quarter. Are those likely to be temporary type of closures or indefinite closures?", "Daniel Fulton", "I can't comment specifically today, Rick. As I mentioned, we already have a number of facilities that are indefinitely closed. We have our operating facilities that have various levels of utilization. And so we're looking at the entire system, and we'll be taking some action, but I can't comment whether it would be temporary or permanent closures. We are taking shift downtime in our overall facilities based upon today's level of demand as we have throughout the year.", "George Staphos", "And can you quantify, Dan, how much the indefinite closures actually cost you in the quarter?", "Daniel Fulton", "I can, but I don't have that number today. We can get back to you. I mean we have closure costs where we provide security. When the mills close, we have some on-site people for some low levels of maintenance and security, and we have depreciation that's related to those mills. All of that runs through our P&L.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I guess the question that I'm ultimately trying to get out is as you look at your sort of your thought on the U.S. housing recovery being a gradual grind higher from here over the next number of years, if there's not a need to maybe take more permanent closures and take off some of those expenses that you're incurring each quarter?", "Patricia Bedient", "Rick, that is something that we're looking at as a part of this review. We don't have any decisions to share with you this morning. I think a way to think about that cost is at its differential, but it's probably in the neighborhood of $5 million to $10 million a quarter.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Dan, as you go to the board here in the next month or two talking about the dividend, can you just frame how you're thinking about that and some of the things that you're considering as you think about setting or proposing what the dividend should be as you go forward?", "Daniel Fulton", "Absolutely. Our boards intent is to set a dividend that is sustainable and one that we can grow over time. In considering the appropriate level of that dividend, we start by looking at the overall macroeconomic climate. We have an evaluation of our own forecast for your earnings over the next several years. We are looking at the level of dividend paid by other timber REITs. We're taking into consideration appropriate capital structure for the company, including appropriate level of debt, the need to maintain access to capital markets and have appropriate liquidity as we go forward and then longer-term, we need to plan for growing the business, especially the core asset of our Timberlands. So all of that becomes part of the calculus for determining what we believe is an appropriate level. And as I said, we'll be communicating that once the board makes the decision in December.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "My three quick question are all based on Cellulose Fibers. First of all, with respect to Cosmopolis, I assume there's a non-compete clause. They will not be doing anything that's [ph] (1:11:31:5) that you're active in?", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes, that's a dissolving pulp mill, and it does not compete with any of our pulp grades.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "And then could you characterize your 1.7 million tons of capacity, and how much is commodity, how much is fluff, and what volume do you have that's in higher-end products?", "Daniel Fulton", "We have five pulp mills. Four in the U.S. South and one in Grand Prairie, Alberta. The Mills in the South primarily produce absorbent fluff. Our Grand Prairie mill produces NBSK. And we have a facts book where we publish actually the capacity for each of these mills. They get you up to that $1.7 million capacity level. Fundamentally, the U.S. South product is heavily focused to what we would consider to be specialty pulp that's going to be large customers that are using it for absorbent products like diapers, feminine hygiene, adult incontinent. Roughly, if you think about our pulp business and the markets that we serve, roughly 1/3 is North America, 1/3 Asia, 1/3 Europe. Those percentages shift a little bit overtime, but the business gives us great exposure to global growth and, especially what we're seeing from our customers is that they have significant growth opportunities in emerging markets. The one consistent theme that we hear from our customers in the Pulp businesses is that they're growing, they need our product, and so we're really pleased with the performance, but also the outlook for that business.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "And I did think it was absorbent. So there is quite a bit of capacity coming on on stream. Do you believe that the demand is sufficient to absorb that capacity? No pun intended.", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes, long-term, I love the pun. Long-term, very confident of the need for that capacity. When it comes online, you're referring to a couple of conversion. So we got Alabama Pine and also the Domtar Plymouth mill that are converting to fluff. That will create in the short-term some new supply. And so there may be a short-term disruption in the market. But long-term, all of that supply is needed. As long as we have this unique characteristic of fiber coming out of the U.S. South from southern yellow pine that's manufactured into that fluff. That is the desired product worldwide for the absorbent products. And so what we're seeing is we're seeing this very strong growth globally as our customers penetrate new markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Atkinson with Bank of Montreal.", "Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "With relates to the credits by alternative fuel credit versus the cellulosic credit. If I understand it correctly, you have $149 million relating to the cellulosic credit. Are you allowed to use the same two in one year or do you have to return the alternative fuel credit you've already received and then redo the process?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, the number I referred to was the number for the credit for primarily the black liquor produced in the first quarter of 2009. And in the first quarter of 2009, we were not lending for the alternative fuel mixture tax credit. So that gallon, gallon each of about $238 million, I think it was. With all the available for the sale of cellulosic producers tax credit. Now what you're referring to is that is there's a potential to unwind the alternative fuel mixture tax credit that we already took and replace it with the biofuel producer's tax credit? And that's something that I think still from a procedural standpoint is being worked out with the IRS. But the numbers that I referred to are for a period of time where we did not have the alternative fuel mixture tax credit.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos", "I'm guessing that you've already answered several questions on Wood Products. My question would be, Dan, if you haven't already answered it, the changes that you're making in the quarter, and as you're thinking about the business relative to your operating stance within Wood Products, is it just a reflection of a deeper cyclical downturn or a more pernicious recovery? Or do you think that you will be changing your overall philosophy regarding Wood Products businesses that you're in and how they fit within the portfolio going forward?", "Daniel Fulton", "We have two issues, George. One is the depth of the housing recession and the slow recovery that I referred to. So even if we were to go back a year ago and look at our housing forecast and that of most economists, what we're experiencing is 2010 was a lower level of starts than anyone anticipated and a longer climb out of this for a variety of reasons. I talked this morning about we still have an issue with consumer confidence, we have an issue with employment, we got an issue with an overhang of inventory, and then we have this new event, which is the foreclosure problem and the documentation related to mortgage security. So that causes us to need to react to a more pessimistic near-term forecast. And what that means for us is we need to adjust capacity to today's level of starts. As we do that, we're also taking the time to evaluate all of our operations. We believe we have opportunities to both enhance revenues as well as to take out operating costs both in our mill and in our SG&A. So it's a full-court effort on all fronts, and as I mentioned earlier, it's the priority we got right now.", "George Staphos", "So you feel in total you have these stable of businesses perhaps that you will have into the recovery, it's just a combination of the cycle just being a little more difficult to climb out of and ways to optimize cost within that stable of business? Would that be the fair characterization?", "Daniel Fulton", "That's a fair characterization, but as I've said before, all of our businesses need to be operating over the cycle at the top quartile levels of performance within their respective industries. And we are not operating at that level in our Wood Products business today. So that's why we need to address it, and we need to improve it.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Joshua Zaret with Longbow Research.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Dan, I read in the press that you either have restart or about to restart two lines at your Hudson Bay OSB mill. What's the thinking there? And would you be closing down something somewhere else to compensate for that? Given this market, it's kind of surprising.", "Daniel Fulton", "Our situation at the Hudson Bay is that that mill has been shut down for an extended period of time. And were we to leave it in its current state, we would be subject to additional costs including severance. And as a result, we made a decision to restart the mill, and we'll be aligning its posture as we go forward in a disciplined manner with production across all of our operations. There will be a slow start. We'll have little production this year. We'll start to see some next year, and then we'll balance it across a system. But fundamentally, it was a decision related to cost of extended shot versus reopening.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "On second, export log volume. Can you give us your volume year-to-date this year versus the year-to-date last year, assuming there's be a big step up, and if there's been any shift in mix there?", "Daniel Fulton", "I don't have that number right in front of me. Let we just talk about the nature of it a bit. One of the things that we've seen over the past year is that there has been a mix shift. So as we think export historically for us, that's Japan. But over the last couple of years, export off of our Western Timberlands operations includes not only Japan, but it is China and Korea. We've said seen a pickup in logs going to China. That, for us, really started two to three years ago as we were harvesting storm damaged wood off of the west coast of Washington and Oregon. That was low quality, low-priced, but it was a great takeaway. And what's happened is that we have been able to develop an improved position in that market. The quality of logs has increased. We are shipping douglas fir logs to China. We got white wood going to Korea, and then as you know, the long-term quality doug fir continues to go to Japan. The amount of export volume is up out of the West about  15%. And as I mentioned that's really favorable for us. We have long-term relationships in the export markets. We got great logistics coming out of our Western Timberlands, so we're well-positioned to take advantage of that. And with domestic markets, which continue to be slow, it has been beneficial for us as a takeaway for the logs coming out of our Western Timberlands. And we would expect that that will continue over time.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "In the old days, there used to be about a $400 at a thousand [ph](1:22:58:4) board foot premium for Japan over the domestic market, then it evaporated. Has that ever come back?", "Daniel Fulton", "Can't comment on the specific spread.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Let me give you my last question because I think its an important one. Everyone's danced around the maintenance, for cellulose, the maintenance charge spent. You gave us guidance in the second quarter of $30 million, zero in the third quarter. What's it going to be in the fourth quarter?", "Patricia Bedient", "The shut in the fourth quarter, Josh, is a short shut at one facility. So it will just be up probably a little around a week or so. So it won't be as significant in terms of relative to the second quarter where we had most of our annual maintenance downtime. And the lost tonnage won't be a significant item.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Thank you very much for joining us this morning. I'm going to turn this call back to Dan.", "Daniel Fulton", "Just some concluding comments. I wanted to just close the call and summarize our key themes for the third quarter and our current view of the fourth quarter. So as we entered the third quarter, we anticipated improved performance in our Cellulose Fibers business, and we delivered record results. Our Wood Products business, we we're already feeling the pain of rapidly falling prices, and it was a very difficult quarter for us. With housing activity near record lows, as we entered the quarter, we expected break-even results for WRECO, then we turned in our third consecutive profitable quarter. And in Timberlands, operating earnings were lower as expected, and our non-strategic land sales enabled us to increase earning next quarter-over-quarter. So as we move to the fourth quarter, we are especially cautious about the near-term direction of the housing market, and we're planning accordingly. We are committed to improving profitability in today's level of demand and we'll continue to take necessary action to reduce costs and improve profitability. And with that, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning, and we look forward to talking to all of you in December. Thanks very much.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Thank you for joining us this morning. If you have any additional questions, please contact me at (253)924-2058.

At this time, I would like to Welcome Everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to introduce Kathy McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I am Kathy McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release and materials for this call can be found at the website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937. ", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q4 2010 net earnings of $171 million or $0.32 per diluted share, a net sales of $1.7 billion. Fourth quarter earnings include after-tax gains of $119 million from special items, an after-tax gain of $31 million on the sale of five short line railroads, an after-tax charge of $89 million for restructuring, closures and impairment. Income tax adjustments of $177 million, which include benefits of $149 million from the Cellulosic Biofuel Producers Credit and $22 million from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to the company's REIT conversion. ", "As we commented last quarter, the Cellulosic Biofuels Credit offsets income tax liability. We will carry the credit forward. Excluding these items, the company reported Q4 2010 net earnings of $52 million or $0.10 per diluted share. ", "For the full year of 2010, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $1,281,000,000 or $3.99 per diluted share on net sales of $6.6 billion. Full year 2010 earnings, include $1,064,000,000 from income tax adjustments related to Weyerhaeuser's conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust. ", "The financial data accompanying our earnings release has been redesigned. We hope you find this new format useful and welcome your comments. Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special item. In our discussions of the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. ", "Turning to Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We began our business segment discussion of the fourth quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. ", "In the fourth quarter, Timberlands contributed $56 million pretax to earnings. The Q3 pretax contribution was $75 million. Earnings from non-strategic Timberlands disposition declined from $34 million in Q3 to $19 million in Q4. ", "Sales volumes declined 3%. Costs were higher due to seasonal downtime in the West and slightly higher fuel costs in silvicultured spending in the South. Key depletion declined 3% in fourth quarter as we continue to defer the harvest. In 2010, the fee harvest was down an additional 10% from the already reduced level of 2009. ", "Western log prices rose 4% while Southern log prices declined 4%. Japanese log export softened in Q4. However, log exports to China increased 10% in the quarter. Japan continues to be our largest log export market. ", "Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Seasonally slower demand and continued difficult market conditions affected the fourth quarter. Before special items, Wood Products lost $85 million. In the previous quarter, the segment lost $100 million. Log cost were slightly lower in the quarter and SG&A cost decreased. Total sales realizations were flat in Q4 with slight increases in lumber prices offsetting decreases in OSB and plywood prices. Lumber sales realizations increased $6 per thousand board feet or 2%. And OSB prices decreased $7 per thousand square feet or 4%. ", "Engineered Solid Section and I-joists sales realizations were flat compared to Q3. Lumber sales volume was down 8% and OSB sales volume decreased 5%. Volumes for Engineered Solid Sections declined 13% and Engineered I-joists volumes decreased 10%. Asset impairment, closures and restructuring charges of $103 million pretax were recognized in the fourth quarter. These charges were for the rationalization of capacity, which includes the permanent closure of three Wood Products facility. ", "Turning to Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. In the fourth quarter, on a pretax basis, Cellulose Fibers earned $138 million. In the third quarter, the business earned $181 million. Costs increased and productivity was lower due to the impact of an annual maintenance outage at the New Bern North Carolina mill. There were no maintenance outages in the third quarter. ", "Pulp shipment volumes declined 2% due to the timing of shipments. Pulp prices were flat in the quarter. ", "And finally turning to Chart 10, Real Estate. Before special items, WRECO contributed $13 million pretax to Q4 earnings. In the third quarter, the business contributed $20 million. ", "The quarter included a $20 million charge for asset impairment and restructuring. 606 single-family homes were closed in Q4, a 21% increase from Q3. The fourth quarter is typically the highest quarter for closings. ", "The average closing price rose to $439,000 from $400,000 due to mix. The margins on single-family homes sold increased to 26.1% for 24.3% in the previous quarter also due to mix. The quarter included $6 million in land sales and related activity. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed decreased to 439 units, a backlog of about 2.5 months. At the end of 2009, the backlog was 3.5 months. ", "I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Last year was one of continued market challenges but also a year where we enhanced our ability to return value to our shareholders and saw the benefits of the work we've done to improve our operations. ", "The most noteworthy event of 2010 involved the completion of our conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust. In the process, shareholders received a $5.6 billion special dividend. ", "Going forward, we are targeting a dividend payout ratio of 75% of funds available for distribution over the cycle. Our Board will determine and declare the actual dividend on a quarterly basis, but beginning in March, we anticipate paying a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share or $0.60 per share on an annualized basis. ", "Converting to a REIT enhances our ability to operate and grow our core asset. The more than 6 million acres of valuable, sustainably managed timberland that we hold and it provides significant benefits to our shareholders. ", "Throughout 2010, market conditions required our business segments to adjust their strategies and their focus. Timberlands continue to defer harvest to preserve the long-term value of our core asset. As Kathy noted, harvest levels dropped 10% compared with 2009. ", "We took advantage of our strategically located Western lands and export facilities to grow Pacific Rim export volumes. Increased exports helped to offset weak domestic demand, which is primarily linked to U.S. housing markets. In 2010, our export volumes grew 18% year-over-year and export share of our total volume increased from 14% to 19%. ", "Increases in shipments to China slightly exceeded increases to Japan for the year though Japan still represents over 75% of our total export volume. ", "Wood Products fades to highly volatile market in 2010 as prices rose sharply in the first four months of the year before experiencing a precipitous decline beginning at the end of the second quarter. As you know, on October 1, I asked Larry Burrows to lead this business. ", "While performance is still unacceptable, our focus on controlling costs, improving cash flow and rightsizing capacity for our long-term needs has begun to show some progress. Wood Products loss narrowed in the fourth quarter even though that quarter is typically our weakest of the year. ", "WRECO is one of the most profitable homebuilders in the country in 2010 despite another extremely challenging year for the U.S. housing market. For the year, we increased margins from 18% to 24% by aggressively cutting costs and leveraging the unique value propositions and local market knowledge of our experienced managers. ", "Our Cellulose Fibers segment set both earnings and production records in 2010. These achievements are the result of our focus on meeting the needs of our global customers by improving mill system productivity and reducing operating costs, actions that positioned us to take full advantage of strong market conditions for pulp. ", "As we mentioned in December, we expect similar housing market conditions for our businesses in 2011. This will continue to present challenges for our Timberlands, Wood Products and Homebuilding segments. ", "In December, our outlook for Cellulose Fibers assume some weakening in pulp prices in 2011 but we're pleased that pricing so far in 2011 has remained relatively stable. Despite continuing market challenges, I expect improved performance from our businesses due to progress that we made in 2010, and our ongoing improvements, operational changes and enhanced cost efficiencies. ", "We expect to continue to defer a portion of our timber harvest although volumes will increase over 2010. In addition, we will flex our harvest in response to market opportunities, including meeting the growing demand from the Asian export market. I expect our Wood Products segment to be cash flow positive. I expect that WRECO, our Homebuilding segment, will continue delivering strong delivery performance relative to its peers. And finally, I expect continued strong operating performance from Cellulose Fibers. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Patty, who will provide our first quarter outlook", "Patricia Bedient", "Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. The outlook comments for the businesses are summarized on Chart 11, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. ", "In the West, export and domestic log prices are expected to increase somewhat due to continued strong demand from China. Southern log realizations may be down slightly. Fee harvest volumes are anticipated to increase seasonally in both the South and the West. We don't expect to incur any downtime in the West as was the case in the fourth quarter. ", "Cost will likely increase in the West due to higher road costs. But in the South, they should decrease due to seasonally lower silviculture cost. Earlier today, we announced the closing of the sale of approximately 82,000 acres of non-strategic plans in the West. This sale represents results in a pretax gain of approximately $150 million in the first quarter.  The transaction represents the sale of the remainder of the storm-damaged whitewoods that we had on the market during 2010. We're pleased with the sales price of approximately $200 million or $2,400 per acre, which is good value given the mix of species and age classes. ", "Before the effect of this sale, we expect that earnings in the first quarter will be higher than the fourth quarter. In Wood Products, we expect that prices and volumes for lumber and OSB will increase over the fourth quarter. Engineered Wood realizations are likely to be flat. ", "Manufacturing costs should be lower for all product lines due to less downtime and obtaining the benefits of recent capacity rationalization and cost reductions. While the first quarter is traditionally a seasonally slow quarter, we do anticipate the loss to decrease significantly compared to the fourth quarter.  ", "Market conditions for our sale of Cellulose Fibers segment continued to be favorable. Global inventories for pulp were at low levels as we entered the quarter. The weak U.S. dollar, strong Chinese demand and a steadily improving global economy should result in continued strong pricing in the first quarter. ", "Our pulp shipment volumes are expected to increase modestly compared to the fourth quarter. Manufacturing costs will likely increase in the first quarter due to higher fiber and chemical costs. Increased scheduled annual maintenance outages will result in higher maintenance costs and decreased productivity compared to the fourth quarter. ", "We expect earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. In our Homebuilding segment, we expect margins and prices to decline due to mix. As Kathy has already discussed, we entered the year with a low backlog and market conditions remain challenging. ", "The first quarter is seasonally a slow quarter for closings and we expect to close approximately 200 fewer homes than in the fourth quarter. We anticipate a slight loss in our single-family homebuilding operations for the first quarter. ", "Now I'll turn to some overall financial comments. As we previously announced in December, we anticipate that the Board will declare quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share to be paid in March. This payout will be approximately $80 million. ", "Following our December announcement, we were pleased that S&P issued a report raising the outlook for our credit rating from negative to stable. We ended the year with strong liquidity, including cash balances of over $1.4 billion and an unused line of credit of $1 billion. We will be focused on renewing this credit line, which expires at the end of this year. ", "Our scheduled debt maturities for 2011 are approximately $30 million, although debt maturities at the beginning of 2012 are over $700 million. Capital expenditures for the company totaled $234 million in 2010 before consideration of cash receipts for government credits of approximately $25 million. ", "For 2011, we expect to spend approximately $250 million. In addition, we expect to receive approximately $15 million of additional government credits for energy-related products -- projects at our Grande Prairie, Alberta pulp mill. Net of these credits, our cash spend is estimated to be $235 million. ", "We anticipate that we will have a seasonal working capital build in the first quarter, primarily related to our Wood Products segment. The amount will depend on market conditions and we will continue our focus of matching supply with demand. During the first quarter, we will also make our semi-annual interest payments of approximately $130 million. We received the proceeds from the 82,000-acre timber sale yesterday and those will help offset these cash outflows. ", "So economic conditions may be challenging in 2011, we are focused on increasing our financial and operating performance and creating value for shareholders. ", "Now I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward your questions", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. In summary, as I reflect on 2010 performance, I see improvement in all businesses shown overall by our swing to profitability. Our 2010 results were positively impacted by actions that we took and improvements that we made. ", "Clearly, I'm not satisfied with where we are but we're headed in the right direction and are well positioned to produce improved operating results. In 2011, our continued focus on improving what we control, while being ready to take advantage of any uptick in market conditions, is the right strategy for achieving improved 2011 financial results. ", "And now, Kathy, we'll move to Q&A.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Nicole, could we please open the floor for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Can you talk a little bit more about the restructuring activity in Wood Products and help us understand the opportunity there, perhaps discussing the benefits from the closures that you received and any potential targets that we can kind of get our heads around as we model 2011?", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes. So within our Wood Products business, our primary product lines, as you know, our lumber, Oriented Strand Board, Engineered Wood Products. And then we have the Distribution business, which is primarily focused on distributing and marketing our engineered product. Our focus in Wood Products starts with a review of capacity utilization. That led us to take the impairments that we announced in December where we took a permanent closure in several facilities that we had shut down previously but determined that at least in the next two to three year period, we would not need that capacity. So our focus is on managing our capacity to deal with today's level of demand and that we anticipate in the next two to three years. We're focused on improving capacity utilization that will bring down our manufacturing costs. But in the shutdown of those facilities, we'll also be saving some noncash expense in the form of depreciation but also security and maintenance costs that are related to those facilities. In all of our product lines, we are focused on improving margins, both from improved pricing opportunities, as well as continued cost reductions both through our operating and manufacturing costs but also in our SG&A. We took G&A out in the fourth quarter. We expect to take out some more this year as well as selling cost. So Gail, our focus in Wood Products is to respond to the market that we have today, to be prepared to respond when the market recovers but in fact, be cash positive with the demand that we have today.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "And are there incremental savings I see the impairment positions in December, there would be some savings that you expect to see in the first quarter from those?", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes, they will start to show up in the first quarter both SG&A, as well as you'll see some reduction and depreciation. And we should expect to see manufacturing costs start to fall a bit as a result of higher utilization in the facilities that we are operating.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "And Dan, can you give us a sense of what operating rates were in the fourth quarter?", "Daniel Fulton", "You're going to have to give me a minute to respond to that, Gail.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "While you look that up just another generic question, I know it's a little bit early, but can you talk about what you're hearing and obviously, your WRECO's backlogs are pretty thin right now just what you're hearing about the spring selling season?", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes, I'll talk about WRECO and then I'll come back to our operating rates in our Wood Products facilities. With respect to the whole market, we and others, entered the year with lower backlogs than we had one year ago. That's an impact primarily of the housing tax credit that was in place at the beginning of 2010 that as you know, went away at the end of April. So we're entering the new year and other builders entering the year with low backlogs. Normally, the spring selling season starts to kick in following the Super Bowl weekend. So don't count on it this week. But believe me, we are going to be looking for traffic signs and sales signs in our own Homebuilding business. But I think what we do is reflective of what other builders do. So what we and other builders would expect to see is some pick up in activity but traffic has been relatively anemic. Homebuyers are still challenged with qualification for mortgages, if they're a first time buyer. If they're a move-up buyer, they are challenged by: number one, the ability to sell their house; and secondly, a number of these move-up buyers may have mortgages that are underwater so that makes the market relatively sticky. And so as we look at 2011, we and others, think of 2011 as a bit of a mirror image of 2010. So 2010 started out more strong, ended up weak. We would expect 2011 to start out weak and then be stronger as we go through the year in order to get to the numbers that are forecast by most economists for 2011 starts. In terms of operating rates in the fourth quarter, in our Lumber business that we were operating at about 60% of capacity. In our OSB business, we were operating at 49% of capacity. In our Engineered Wood Products business, it was more in the 30% range. So Engineered Wood Products, as you know, primarily go into new home construction. Lumber, we've got a number of different markets, including the repair and remodel market. OSB has some alternatives other than just new home construction but the Engineered is focused on new home construction.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "I guess for Patty, can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the tax rate for 2011?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure, Gail. As you know, the tax rate as we go forward is pretty sensitive to the blend of income in the REIT versus the TRS. And of course, the income in the REIT is not taxable. So as we sit here today, we would look at the blended tax rate being something just a little over 20% for 2011 as we go forward maybe around the 22%, but it'll change depending upon how that mix changes as we go out in the year, but that's our best estimate at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "I was curious on the land you sold in Washington, can you comment on the average age of the inventory?", "Patricia Bedient", "I would say, Pete, I don't have the average age overall but the whitewood that were predominantly on that land were more of the merge. There were doug fir some but it's pretty merged that's on there. So the whitewood stance would be a higher age class than the lesser amount of doug fir that was there.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "So is it fair to characterize as mostly pre-merge or is it not necessarily the case?", "Patricia Bedient", "There was some but remember these are the storm-damaged lands that were damaged by the storm in 2007. So we had salvaged. This particular track I think didn't have I think as much as some of the others but we did salvage a lot of wood off those storm-damaged lands that we sold.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And Dan, I was curious if you could comment on Shipping, remind us what you have in terms of assets in that business. And does it provide a competitive advantage to your Pacific Northwest timber as you look at the Asian opportunity?", "Daniel Fulton", "We have a Shipping business, Westwood shipping. The primary business of Westwood is really container trade, Pete. And our largest log customer in Japan operates its own ships into our West Coast operations. And so our logs are going out on their ships. As we shipped to China and Korea, some of that log volume goes out in containers, some of it goes out on a bulk [ph]. We are not dependent on our own ships although some of them are used for that purpose. So it's not a critical strategic need for us as it might have been in the past given that there's a range of alternatives for exporting those logs.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Patty, can you update us on the underfunded pension balance at the end of the year?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure. Our funded status has improved year-over-year. Just going back to last year at this time, we were underfunded about $600 million on a PBO basis. And as we sit here today, we're just under $500 million underfunded. Now this includes the liability for our nonqualified plans as well as our qualified plans. And as you know, we don't fund the nonqualified plans. That's about $200 million of that balance. As we look at underfunded status, it improved as a result certainly of the contributions that we made, also the return on the assets that we have invested in those funds. So our investment return was probably on the order of around $500 million. Benefit payments out of those plans were around $330 million. And then the other big piece that moved in a negative way in terms of this funded status would be in the actuarial assumption around discount rate. Now the discount rate in the U.S. for example, we moved from 5.9 down to 5.4.. In Canada, from 6.1 down to 5.3.. The interest rate assumptions increased the underfunded status by about $370 million. So that was a negative factor as we look at the funding. So those are some of the puts and takes. And as we filed the 10-K later this month, you'll see all of the details of it, but those are the main swings in the underfunded status. One thing I would point out as you look forward into 2011, the noncash expense associated with these plans will change. In 2010, we had a $47 million pension credit as we amortized the actuarial assumption changes. As we go into 2011, that will swing to a $60 million noncash expense, as we amortize the actuarial losses that are on our balance sheet today and but they sit in other comprehensive income. So as we amortized those through the P&L and expense, we anticipate about a $60 million pension expense.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "First question just to make sure we have this right. You mentioned, Patty, a $60 million expense of noncash for this year. What was it in 2010?", "Patricia Bedient", "2010, it was for pension, it was a $47 million credit.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "So that will be a swing that we'll see sort of on ongoing earnings of $107 million then?", "Patricia Bedient", "Yes. So remember, that's as I said, that's a noncash charge that runs through the P&L. The other piece that you're probably interested in would be the pension contributions that we anticipate in 2011. I had said on the third quarter call that we thought that we would be contributing about $100 million in 2011 to our Canadian plan. That looks like it'll be probably more on the order of $80 million as we finalize the numbers. We don't have to make a contribution to our U.S. plans in 2011. Any contribution that we would make would be not have to be made until 2012. But if we make a contribution at all, it likely will not be of any significant amounts because our U.S. plans are just slightly underfunded. The other payout will be in our nonqualified plan, the ones that I said that we don't fund and that runs around $20 million pretty much year-to-year.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And Patty, as we look at that $107 million swing, that doesn't occur on the corporate line, right? It actually is in the segments and can you give us, if that's true, what the rough breakdown is?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure. What we do for pension expense, we take the pension expense through the Corporate segment and we allocate out to each of the segments their portion of the service costs. So they don't get the whole expense. They do just get the service cost going forward and the offset comes into the corporate line. So for example as you look on Page 9, I think it is of the analyst package, we've mentioned that we have about $74 million of credit in the Corporate segment in 2010. That $74 million is higher than the number I gave you before because the offset to it is the expense that's charged in the segment. And we'll give you a breakdown of that. I think it'll be about the charge that will go into the segment line. It's about $48 million. So we'll charge expense of $48 million into the segments and then we'll offset that credit in the Corporate segment to get a total net expense of $60 million.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "In the Timberlands, you mentioned you sold or had HBU sales or land sales of $131 million in '10 up from $77 million in '09. If we exclude the deal you just closed today, what is a good guess as to both the land sales, these exchanges and the HBU sales in 2011?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, those sales since they are non-strategic, they come about as a part of upgrading our portfolio. So they're not all necessarily even HBU sales. They really are sales of Timberland, where we believe we can trade out of what we have currently for a better value in terms of those exchanges. So I think as we look over the course of the last few years. If you back out the sale that we announced for the 82,000 acres, it'll probably be something less than what we have had on an ongoing basis. And I think historically, those run in the realm of around $100 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Dan, is it possible to get some sort of sense of the benefit that you think you'll get from this pickup in Chinese purchases of logs and lumber? Because it sounds like what they're buying is kind of below what you typically try to sell.", "Daniel Fulton", "It is below what we try to sell in lumber. So let me take them in two parts, Mark. In terms of logs, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen a dramatic pickup in exports to China. It is still only about a fifth of the volume that we're sending to Japan but this has all happened over the last several years. For us, the pickup in exports to China started as we started to harvest the storm-damaged woods on the west side of Oregon and Washington following the December 2007 storm. So at that point, they were taking storm-damage wood as well as some of that was going to Korea. And over time, what we've seen is a steady upgrade in the value and the quality of the wood that they're taking. It's still not the same grade as the Japan log but there has been really a steady increase in both volume as well as the quality of the logs that they're importing. As you know, some of that's related to the slowdown in exports from Russia. But it seems like it's a combination of slowdown in Russia and perhaps some other markets that may have been exporting into China plus the general pickup in their economy. Still going into what we believe are industrial grades and industrial applications, concrete formwork et cetera, but there's been steady improvement. With respect to lumber, they started taking lumber primarily out of British Colombia, build damaged wood, and that continues to be the case. We are further away from the coast in D.C. and so that's not a primary market. But the benefit that we see is to the extent that any volume of logs or lumber is being exported to China, on a marginal basis creates more opportunity for us in North America.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Second question I had is just generally any thoughts about kind of the potential for more non-strategic asset sales in 2011 whether that's likely to be a material amount for you guys?", "Daniel Fulton", "We have some non-strategic assets we've identified in the past, as you know, we had identified the railroads. We had identified some of those non-strategic Timberland. We evaluate opportunities all the time and our goal was to monetize them when the market's appropriate but I can't give you any guidance for specifics for the balance of this year, Mark.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then the other thing I was curious about is just your Specialty Cellulose business, because it seems like a lot of your competitors have been making moves here over the last six to 12 months. GP acquired a pretty large producer and is converting to fluff. Rayonier is looking at investing to kind of go up the value chain and Domtar is getting in the -- how do you think about what you want to do in that business going forward?", "Daniel Fulton", "We like the Fluff business. We've got strong customer relationships with customers that are growing globally that need the product that we produce. We have seen some shift to fluff as you identified both with Domtar as well as GP. But at the same time, there is this increased interest in dissolving pulp with some manufacturers talking about converting some of their fluff capacity to dissolving pulp. So we view that as positive because there may be some existing fluff that may be converted and that will create some opportunity for us. We have customer relationships globally and we'll continue to seek out opportunities to improve the mix that we produce in the overall margin that we're able to gain out of selling to those customers. But the market is in flux a bit as you know, with this heavy demand for dissolving pulp driven primarily by, what I believe, are about 140 year-high prices for cotton.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Could you see putting a lot more capital into the Cellulose business?", "Daniel Fulton", "I can't see putting a lot more capital in the near term. We are investing to maintain the effectiveness of our mills. A lot of the capital that we put into our mills is targeted at projects that will reduce cost, primarily energy. So we've got some green energy projects and those that will improve our cost of production but we're not anticipating any significant increase in capital spend.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Is it possible, Patty, to just help us kind of bridge on the maintenance in that business as we go from fourth quarter to first quarter? It sounds like it's going to be up but I'm not sure how much it's going to be up, and then what kind of a drop-off we might see as we go into the second quarter?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure, Mark. Let me start by saying, as you point out, the maintenance outages are lumpy in that business. So last year, we had two in the first quarter, three in the second and then shorter one in the fourth, which was our New Bern, North Carolina mill. So as we go moving from the fourth to the first quarter now, we will have two outages in the first quarter. Those outages will be longer and somewhat more extensive than the New Bern shutdown in the fourth quarter. I think the way to think about it is that in terms of increased expense over what we spent in the fourth quarter, for maintenance spend itself, it will probably be on the order of say, $25 million to $30 million additional maintenance expense. And then we'll also have an impact to productivity of those two mills being down and some additional chemical costs. So I think that's the way to think of going from Q4 to Q1. And then in Q2, it depends on how many mills will be down in Q2 but if it was similar to last year, for example, where we had three, we actually had more maintenance in the second but I don't have that maintenance schedule in front of me.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "When we look at your changes you made in the Homebuilding offerings, you made a lot of changes in price points and value propositions. And it looks like that has paid off nicely when I hear your comments and think about what's happened to margins. Can you give us a sense, Dan, of whether we're going to see another shift like that this year or should we be thinking of this as more of a slowly evolving shift in trends? Because the last one was sort of a big discrete step change, I'm just wondering if we should be anticipating something like that again.", "Daniel Fulton", "You should not anticipate a significant step change. This is really an ongoing process that all of our subsidiaries are engaged in, not just because of the market that we're in today but they continue to adjust their value propositions over time. We do have an evolving market today and there has been a shift to somewhat smaller product. Although ironically, our one operation in the Pacific Northwest Quadrant Homes, which is a first-time buyer of Homebuilder has actually upgraded their product in today's market and that seems to be a more effective value proposition than their old ones. So what you see in the results is a function of, I think, our local operators are finding to opportunities and competitive niches in their own market places. And it's also a function of the markets in which we operate, our land position, which as you know, is significant as compared to some other homebuilders, and we've been able to capitalize on that in this market.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So overall, are you saying that you're pretty happy with the propositions across all the markets right now?", "Daniel Fulton", "We are. These are all very competitive markets. And if you were to think about longer-term shifts in product type, I don't think we would see anything radical in WRECO. There may be some greater shifts in some of the national homebuilders as they have downsized product and everyone is searching for a formula that will make them successful and fundamentally make them profitable. We watch that from the perspective of our Wood Products business because to the extent that higher density product is being built, that has some implications for Engineered Wood Products. Square footage changes have an implication on the amount of lumber and Engineered Wood Products, which is used in every single house.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "On the book tax rate, you gave us that, thank you. Is it fair to say that your cash taxes would be a lot lower because of being able to use Biofuel Credits et cetera? Can you tell us what cash taxes would likely be?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure, Mark. You're exactly right. We will utilize the biofuel tax credit going forward. So cash taxes for 2011, I would anticipate would be significantly lower than our book tax.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "And then second, you talked about over the course of the cycle paying out roughly 75% of funds available to the dividend potentially. Should we be thinking about things like the Washington sale as a part of those funds available? Or do you think of that as something separate and then how about the other $100 million or so of land sales that you would typically have in the year? Would that be something that would be included in your thought process of funds available or not?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure. Let me think about or talk about 2011. So as we said the dividend, talked with the Board and they determined the final dividend for 2011, we did have knowledge about these asset sales at that point in time. And as we said on our dividend call, they were included in the numbers in the consideration for setting the dividend in 2011. I think as we go forward past that, it's the large numbers that if we were to have additional non-strategic plans of a really significant amount that we deal with that at that point in time, we don't have any identified at this point. In terms of an ongoing just the normal timber sales that we do on a regular basis, those would be included in our funds available for distribution. But remember that a lot of those, we do with 1031 exchanges to avoid having to pay the tax on them because even though we are in the REIT for the next 10 years, we will have to pay tax on any timberland that we sell. So I'd anticipate that just as a course of business to the extent we can, we would try to do those with 1031 exchanges.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "On the Timberland harvest for 2011, can you give us a sense of what you expected it to be relative to 2010?", "Daniel Fulton", "We expect it to be up. You would like a percentage, wouldn't you?", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "I'd love it.", "Patricia Bedient", "I don't think it's up probably any more than 10%, Mark, but let us take a look at that and get you a more...", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Just one last clarification, on the pension. If I understand it rightly, since service and cost would probably stay roughly the same in 2011 to 2010. So for modeling purposes, effectively that $107 million swing would basically run through the corporate line. Is that the right way to look at it? And if so, what should we use in order of magnitude for corporate expense for the full year?", "Patricia Bedient", "That is it pretty close to the right way to look at it. I think, Mark, we're going to be charging about as I said before right around $40 million or $50 million to the segments. So if you took that -- and last year, I think we had roughly the same number, maybe just a little lower than that but it was in the low to mid-40s. So I think your analysis about all-in, year-over-year in the segment is going to be pretty similar. So last year, for example, we had a net credit of $47 million. We charged the segments about $42 million, I think. And so the additional credit that you see on the analyst package on Page 9 for the Corporate segment I think was $74 million. That $74 million also includes an offset of about $16 million that for the post-employment benefit costs. So you've got two things going on there. You've got pension and other post-employment costs and we don't charge the other post employment out to the various segments. So that would stay in the corporate. So going forward then into 2011, we'll have about $16 million for pension and another $16 million again for other post employment. Those will run through the corporate line and then we will also charge out to the segments about $48 million, I think it is, and that credit will come into the segment line at Corporate.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "So will Corporate be roughly $20 million, $25 million a quarter in 2011 for everything?", "Patricia Bedient", "For everything, it'll be about $16 million, for other post-employment benefits. And for pension, it'll be about another $10-ish million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chercover with D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Going back to the Pulp business a little bit, you're old Cosmopolis mills now coming back as a desolving pulp mill. So when you see assets coming back, does it make you change your view on whether to close or sell them and that could be applicable to building materials as well?", "Daniel Fulton", "It hasn't changed our view with respect to the Cosmopolis mill. And in particular, let me just talk about that. That was a business that we decided to exit. It was a mill that took a significant amount of capital to maintain and operate over time. And we were pleased to sell it. The impact of that mill coming back is actually positive because it creates some additional demand for fiber in the region and puts a number of people back to work in that community that were long-time Weyerhaeuser employees. As we look at other facilities, we look at the impact of the mill if we were to sell it, becoming a competitor. So the Cosmopolis mill is not a competitor of ours. If we were to be exiting other manufacturing facilities, including some in the Wood Products business, we would certainly evaluate the impact on our position in the remaining facilities in that sector and make a determination accordingly whether or not we wanted to sell it or shut it down.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Could you just confirm that the 82,000 acres that you're selling was part of your 2011 expectations when you establish your dividend policy in December?", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes, it was. We had talked last year about the fact that it had been on the market for a period of time. The last guidance that I provided about that was that we had increased interest and we thought that we would have a transaction that we might be able to execute really in 2011. So it was factored into our expectations when we provided our dividend guidance.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your cash position given what we've seen recently in the credit markets? Cash net of or including the Hancock sale this morning seems to be closer to $1.6 billion and you have some pretty modest capital spending targets for '11 and even taking into account the 2012 debt maturities, at what point I guess, the question is, what level of cash balances do you feel comfortable running at for the next couple of years? And would you feel comfortable with your refinancing prospects in 2012 that you're sufficiently comfortable using some of that cash today for other shareholder activities?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, as we go in into 2011, I think as we talked about on the dividend call, we knew that we would have this cash coming in on the sale. As we look forward, the 2011 environment is pretty uncertain in terms of the housing market. And as we think about our cash balances, we were very comfortable looking at dividend-ing out pretty close to 100% of our funds available from distribution in 2011. We're in the process of looking at renewing our credit line of $1 billion that expires at the end of this year. So I think as we go forward, we'll continue to think about what the best use of cash is and how the markets unfold in terms of economic recovery in 2011. So what we said in terms of a debt balance was that we thought that given the cyclicality and the makeup of the portfolio as we sit here today, that's something under $4 billion of total debt would be appropriate. Now as you point out, on a net debt basis, we are there as we sit here today and that really depends on what we do with our cash going forward. But we're very comfortable that we can deal with those maturities, we're comfortable that we can deal with the economic scenarios as they unfold. And how much cash we will need will be a function of all of those as well as renewing our bank credit line, which I think will be a very favorable development.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "You had referenced before some increasing manufacturing costs and chemical costs on the Fibers business. Can you talk a little bit more about that maybe in percentage terms, what you're seeing there and what the expectations are for the first half of the year?", "Daniel Fulton", "Expectations, Josh, are that those costs are moving up a bit. In some locations, we've got fiber costs also increasing. I don't have a specific percentage that I can provide you at this point.", "Patricia Bedient", "I don't have a specific percentage for you, Josh. Part of the chemical cost increase also in the first quarter over the fourth quarter is a result, I think of additional maintenance because we tend to use additional chemicals when we take the mills down for maintenance. So I don't know that, that was necessarily a long-term chemical cost but it really will be a function of what happens to oil prices as we go forward and how that impacts the rest of the chemical costs. So we don't have a longer-term forecast on the first quarter for you.", "Daniel Fulton", "So as we close the call, I'd just like to summarize our key theme for the new year. And that is that as we and other builders enter 2011 with lower sales backlogs in the year ago, we'll need housing sales to gain momentum throughout the year in order to reach forecasted annual levels. ", "Our focus therefore, in our Timberlands Wood Products and WRECO businesses is to continue to improve profitability in today's level of demand, while being prepared to take advantage of our significant operating leverage if the pace of recovery picks up. ", "In our Cellulose Fibers business, we'll continue to focus on operational excellence, while meeting the needs of our growing customers. The closing of our approximately $200 million sale of non-strategic lands in the West that we announced earlier today is a solid start for the year and we look forward to building on this base with improving operational performance.

Ma'am, you may begin your conference.", "Kathryn McAuley", "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. I am Kathy McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release and materials for this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937. ", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. ", "Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q1 2011 net earnings of $99 million or $0.18 per diluted share, a net sales of $1.6 billion. First quarter earnings include an after-tax gain of $96 million on a previously announced sale of 82,000 acres of nonstrategic Timberlands in Southwest Washington State. Excluding this special item, the company reported net earnings of $3 million, break-even on a per share basis. ", "Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussions of business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. ", "Chart 4, Changes in Contribution to Earnings by Segment. This chart illustrates the changing contribution by business segment from fourth quarter 2010 to first quarter 2011. ", "We begin our business segment discussion of the first quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the first quarter, Timberlands contributed $89 million to pretax earnings before special items, $33 million more than in Q4 2010. Third party sales volumes rose 4% from Q4. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Japan remains our largest export market accounting for approximately 70% of export volume. ", "Third party average log price realizations increased 5% in the West and declined 2% in the South. The fee harvest increased 11% from the fourth quarter, most of the increase occurred in the West and was driven by export demand. ", "Higher volumes resulted in lower costs in the West. Costs in the South were lower due to less silviculture spending. Some of the cost improvement was offset by rising diesel prices. ", "Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Excluding special items, Wood Products narrowed its loss from $85 million to a loss of $36 million, an improvement of $49 million. Lumber and OSB sales realizations increased 8%. Lumber volumes were flat. OSB volumes increased 9%. Operating rates for lumber and OSB were higher in first quarter. Log costs rose in the West. Solid section volumes were flat and prices declined slightly due to mix. TJI volumes fell 10%, prices modestly increased. ", "Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $86 million to pretax earnings in Q1, $52 million less than in Q4. Maintenance costs increased and productivity was lower due to two scheduled annual outages in the quarter. In addition, we also had $7 million of spending in first quarter, preparing for the annual maintenance outages scheduled for the second quarter. ", "Fiber costs were higher in the West and chemical costs increased. Pulp price realizations declined $14 per ton. The majority of our pulp production, fluff and fluff pulp prices were slightly lower. Pulp volumes were flat. ", "Real Estate, Chart 10. WRECO lost $1 million in the first quarter. First quarter is the seasonally weakest of the year. Single-family closings were down 40% from Q4 and 8% from the first quarter a year ago. The average closing price declined $20,000 to $419,000 due to mix. The gross margin was 22%, down from 26% in Q4, also due to mix. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 611 homes. ", "And finally, Corporate & Other. Before special items, Corporate & Other contributed $43 million less to earnings in first quarter. Pension and postretirement expense held in corporate was a noncash charge of $12 million in Q1. In Q4, it was a credit of $19 million. Share-based compensation expense rose $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the increase in our stock price. ", "I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy. And good morning, everyone. Over the last several earnings calls, I've been reporting on how we're doing as we battle this dismal housing market. I'm glad to report that we continue to make progress during the first quarter. ", "Our top line grew year-over-year, as well as our bottom line. And I remind you that this occurred while U.S. housing softened. While margins and returns are still not where we want them to be, we continue to act on the items that we control and take advantage of every opportunity. ", "In my remarks this morning, I will comment on three subjects. First, I want to talk about general economic conditions, with a particular focus on the U.S. housing market since new home construction has such a critical impact on our company's overall performance. Second, I'll discuss the performance of our businesses during the first quarter, adding some color to the information that's already included in our quarterly analyst package and to the summary that Kathy just provided. ", "And finally, I want to discuss the effect of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami on our business. Although I'll address the importance of the Japanese market to us, I want to emphasize that this tragic event had no material impact on our first quarter financial results. We do expect that rebuilding needs in Japan will likely lead to opportunities for increased log and lumber exports over the midterm, but it's too early to tell if there will be any material impact this year.", "I'll start with general economic conditions and their effect on our first quarter performance. With respect to the U.S. economy, GDP growth has been trending up slowly, but downward revisions of projected growth in 2011 announced earlier this week by the Fed indicate that the recovery may be stalling. Additional comments by Fed Chairman Bernanke further confirmed that there continues to be an abundance of caution. ", "Increasing oil prices are a major concern for us because of the impact on our manufacturing cost, as well as how they affect disposable income and consumer confidence. In Timberlands, for example, increases in diesel prices result in higher harvesting and hauling costs. In our other businesses, higher oil prices result in increased cost for raw materials and energy. ", "At the consumer level, increases in oil prices translate quickly to rising gasoline prices which directly affect the pocketbook of potential homebuyers who may have been ready to reenter the housing market. ", "As contrasted the GDP growth in the U.S., global growth is increasing at a faster pace, especially in emerging economies. This faster-paced growth has had a positive impact on our Cellulose Fibers business, which supplies global customers, and our Timberlands business, which leverages the geographic advantage of our Western forests, as well as our long-term trading relationships in key Asian markets. ", "Turning to the state of the U.S. housing market, the Fed this week described conditions in the housing sector as depressed. In our press release this morning, we used the medical term anemic to describe current conditions and the medical analogy seems appropriate. The U.S. housing market has been in intensive care for the last couple of years. We moved to the recovery room last year, boosted by both federal as well as some state housing tax credits, but then the markets suffered a relapse in the second half of 2010. ", "As we entered 2011, we were planning on single-family starts recovering to an annual level of approximately 525,000, certainly not an aggressive number at that time. But March data shows starts at a seasonally adjusted rate of only 422,000, 21% lower than one year ago. ", "On the positive side, housing affordability is at an all-time high and we did see a slight improvement nationally in new home sales in March, up from the February level which was the lowest since World War II. Perhaps the worst is behind us but our experience from the last several years causes us to be cautious, and we're focusing on being profitable at today's level of starts while maintaining our ability to respond to improve demand signals. ", "To get housing back on track for a slow, steady recovery, our economy still needs to work through the challenges of continued foreclosures, as well as the clear direction from Congress on resolution of the still uncertain future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. ", "Despite the continued drag on our company by the slow recovery in housing, I'm pleased with the progress that we continue to make in improving performance at today's level of starts in our Timberlands, Wood Products and WRECO businesses while taking advantage of continued strength in global demand for our Cellulose Fibers. ", "In Timberlands, the big story this quarter is the Chinese demand for logs. One year ago, China represented 6% of our total export volume, and in the first quarter, the Chinese share of our exports increased to 24%. The location of our Pacific Northwest Timberlands, our extensive logistics systems, our strategically located port facilities and our long-term trading relationships uniquely allow us to take full advantage of the Asian market, helping us to offset the continued softness in U.S. housing. ", "Though Chinese demand is relatively small in the context of our overall volume, this increased demand has led to rising log prices in the West for both export as well as domestic logs, resulting in higher log realizations for the quarter that Kathy highlighted. ", "Turning to our Wood Products business, mill productivity increased as operating rates for lumber, OSB and engineered solid sections all improved as a result of steps taken in 2010 to further rationalize production capacity. The net result of ongoing improvements across the business, including customer selection, pricing improvement and the lower cost structure was an increase in our gross margin and positive cash flow before seasonal build up in working capital. We're still not where we want to be but we are seeing noticeable improvement. ", "In our WRECO business, as expected, earnings were approximately breakeven despite very weak demand. We did, however, see evidence of improvement in some market indicators. Though year-over-year traffic levels are down, our conversion rate of turning shoppers into buyers increased significantly and our cancellation rates dropped to levels we have not seen since 2003. ", "Comparing market conditions across WRECO, the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. show the greatest improvement, followed by Phoenix and the Puget Sound region. Houston sales remain stable and California and Nevada activity declined year-over-year, in part because last year's first quarter included several new project openings which generally boost sales activity. ", "Shifting to our Cellulose Fibers business. The softwood pulp market remains tight, driven by increased demand for dissolving pulp. For the quarter, earnings were up significantly year-over-year but fell from our record fourth quarter levels, primarily due to increased expense and downtime related to scheduled maintenance at our mills in Flint River and Longview. ", "We are seeing opportunities in Cellulose Fibers for new products that are the outcome of our strategy of continuous innovation to serve the needs of our growing global customers and we expect that the percentage of revenues from these new products will increase over time. ", "Let me close with the discussion of Japan, a trading partner dating back to 1923, when we first entered the market to supply lumber for rebuilding, following the Great Kanto earthquake which devastated the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama. ", "Since 1923, our relationship has grown to the point where sales to customers in Japan represented approximately 10% of our total revenue last year. While we do not have any manufacturing facilities in Japan, whereas our products sold to Japan include pulp, liquid packaging board, newsprint, logs and lumber, and Japan is the primary market for our Westwood Shipping line. ", "While Japan is an important market for us, we've seen only a small impact from the March 11 earthquake. Our sales to customers in the impacted zone are roughly 2% of our total revenues and most of these customers were able to shift production to other parts of the country. ", "Immediately following the earthquake, our attention turned to the safety and welfare of our employees and our ship's crews, and thankfully, everyone is safe. We have focused on our ongoing efforts to meet the needs of our customers, redirecting supply lines to address shortages and adjustments in operating projects. ", "Mid to longer term, once essential infrastructure needs are met, there should be an increase in demand for logs and wood products which would be used to build permanent housing to replace the housing that was lost, and we are well positioned to work with our long-term customers and trading partners to provide materials for rebuilding, just as we did in 1923 and again in 1995 following the Kobe earthquake.  ", "And now, Patty will discuss our outlook, and then I'll provide a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?", "Patricia Bedient", "Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the second quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. ", "Export log demand in Asia is anticipated to remain strong. In the West, sales realizations and volumes are expected to increase somewhat but this will likely be offset by rising prices for diesel fuel and seasonal increases in road and silvicultural costs. In South, we anticipate slightly higher sales volumes and flat sales realizations. Earnings in the South will also be negatively affected by rising fuel. ", "Overall, not including the effect of any nonstrategic land sales, we expect Timberland earnings to increase somewhat in the second quarter compared to the first. ", "Market conditions in Wood Products for the second quarter are very uncertain. We have yet to experience normal signs of the spring building season. However, our forecast does include somewhat higher sales volumes for all products. Sales realizations for most product lines are expected to be flat. ", "Higher productivity as a result of increased production volume should lead to more favorable manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by increased log costs. We expect the loss in the second quarter to narrow compared to the first quarter and we should be cash positive. ", "Global demand in our Cellulose Fibers segment continues to be robust. We expect sales realizations to improve in the second quarter compared to the first. Sales volumes are anticipated to also increase slightly. Freight costs will likely be higher during the quarter. ", "Additional planned maintenance outages will lead to higher maintenance costs and additional lost productivity for the second quarter as compared to the first. After the second quarter, our planned outages will be complete for the year. Despite these increased costs, we expect that overall, earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will increase compared to the first quarter. ", "In our Real Estate segment, we expect our single-family homebuilding business to improve seasonally during the second quarter. Homes closed are anticipated to increase to approximately 500 closings compared to 363 closings in Q1. The average closing price will likely decline slightly due to mix. However, we anticipate margins to continue to be strong at around 20% to 22%. ", "We remain focused on actions within our control despite the continued headwinds of weak consumer confidence, only modest job growth and buyers challenged by mortgage qualification issues. We expect to earn a small profit in the second quarter in our single-family homebuilding business. ", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. Our cash balance as of the end of the quarter was just under $1.5 billion. Capital spending during the first quarter was approximately $47 million. For the full year, we expect to spend between $250 million to $270 million. We anticipate receiving approximately $15 million in credits from the Canadian government for projects at our Grande Prairie Alberta pulp mill. ", "Our current bank credit facility of $1 billion expires at the end of this year. No borrowings are outstanding under the agreement and we anticipate replacing this facility by the end of the second quarter. We have $30 million of debt payments due in the second quarter which completes our scheduled debt maturities for the year. ", "Our noncash pension expense and postretirement expense in the first quarter was a charge of about $24 million. This was slightly higher than what we anticipate on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year. ", "Based on updated estimates of the funded status of our U.S. qualified pension plan, we will not be required to make a contribution for 2011. At year end, we had estimated that the U.S. planned contribution could have been as much as $20 million. We still do expect to fund approximately $80 million into our Canadian plan later this year. ", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. In summary, despite challenging conditions in the U.S. housing market which are worse than one year ago, we continue to make progress during the first quarter to improve our financial performance. We're expecting improvement in all businesses in the second quarter based upon actions that we've taken and improvements that we have made in order to increase our competitiveness. ", "We're focused on making the most of existing market conditions and we're prepared to leverage our scale to take full advantage of any market improvement. ", "As we now get ready to turn to questions, I want to make one final comment in anticipation of perhaps questions about weather events this week in the South. We've all heard and seen on TV stories of tornadoes throughout the South that's affected some of our operations in both our Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products business. ", "First of all, I want to say that all of our employees and their families are safe. We are assessing damage as we speak. We suffered some limited power outage at our Columbus Modified Fiber facility but our pulp mill is operating. We've had some limited damage of Timberlands, but we won't have any full assessment until we're able to get up in the air and survey the damage. ", "We've had some property damage in some of our Wood Products facilities and some minor power outages, but at this point, it's likely that there will be no material impact on our activities in the second quarter, and we'll have further reports as our people are able to get back out to the field. I just wanted to provide an additional assessment of how we've come through this past week. ", "So with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Patty and invite your questions.", "Patricia Bedient", "Nicole, we'd like to open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Wanted to start with a few questions on the Wood Products operations. Your volumes were up reasonably year-on-year, and I'm just wondering, do you think you took some market share or do you think customers were building inventories because that seems a little out of line with the underlying demand?", "Daniel Fulton", "I think, Gail, in the first quarter, there is some build in inventory in anticipation of a building season. We talked on the last call about waiting until after the Super Bowl to see if there's a spring selling season. Based upon what we reported this morning and what we see certainly reported nationally, the market is still very soft but we, as you noted, did have some increase in activity. More importantly, for our Wood Products business, we've seen increase in margins which is related to the focus that we've had on focusing on our pricing as well as cost management. But as I noted in my comments and I spent a fair amount of time talking about it, we are concerned about U.S. housing recovery. The first quarter numbers are not healthy, and so we're managing our business based upon the volume that's available today and positioning ourselves to grow with the recovery.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just following on, on that, your second quarter guidance were fairly flat realizations in Wood Products. Have you -- was there a lag in pricing that would give you confidence in that? Because current prices would suggest a reasonable decline.", "Daniel Fulton", "Well, there's a bit of a lag. We're already one month into the quarter, and so the guidance that we've provided is the best information that we've got.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just thinking, can you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the West Coast in terms of the trends in Chinese demand? Has it continued to grow? Is there any fund that's slowing in either kind of the U.S. Northwest or British Columbia? And also, you've kind of referenced log costs being up in the West, and how you see that impacting domestically oriented sawmills in the West?", "Daniel Fulton", "So to answer the questions sequentially, talking about general Chinese trends, Gail, we've been watching the building demand over the last 18 months. Lumber demand has primarily impacted Canadian lumber producers in the West. In Timberlands business, the log demand from China has occurred primarily in operations in Washington and Oregon. As we noted, we've had a steady increase in the amount of export that we've been shipping to China. In the lumber business in Canada, it started several years ago with shipments of beetle-damaged wood, and gradually, the volumes have picked up and the quality has picked up. As we've noted before, the Wood Products are going into industrial uses, primarily forms for concrete work, shoring, pallets and packing. We don't see demand backing off at this point, and so we are taking advantage of the opportunity in our Timberlands business to increase flows to the market because we've got longer-term relationships and we've got strategically advantaged logistical facilities. And we are shipping some lumber out of Canada, but given the location of our sawmills, it's not a heavy percentage.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just a question in terms of margins for domestic sawmill and for sawmills in the West, given rising log costs, is that a major concern for you?", "Daniel Fulton", "It is a concern because as you know and as we've talked about, the U.S. housing market has been relatively weak, and so there's not a lot of pricing power for lumber producers. So log prices have moved up because of the demand from Asia and it is putting a bit of a squeeze on lumber producers.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. But no sign of that impacting log demands at this point?", "Daniel Fulton", "We have not seen it.", "Patricia Bedient", "So I think the whole question of the impact of China on the domestic market is difficult to dimension because we do have some logs that we sell domestically that could go to export, so others that are exporting as well, as well as some of the domestic producers are shipping lumber to China. So that helps the domestic market as well for domestic producers. So I think it's a little mixed in terms of the China impact isn't really all exported, it does flow over a little bit to the domestic market, which is good given that the U.S. housing market is weak.", "Daniel Fulton", "And then, I think as I mentioned related to the Japanese earthquake, we would anticipate that there would be a pickup in demand from the West Coast, not only for logs but for lumber. But at this point, it's too early to tell what the timing will be because they do have to work through their issues of infrastructure before they are ready to take on significant rebuilding of permanent structures. The focus right now is on temporary structures because of the incredible amount of damage that was done in the tsunami.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "So you're keeping the regular volumes to Japan at this point?", "Daniel Fulton", "We are. We've seen very little disruption, Gail, in shipments to Japan. Immediately after the earthquake, there was the need for some rerouting and some short-term disruption. In our log export business, we had some logs that were scheduled to be shipped to Japan and on a short-term basis, they were rerouted to China. But we expect that the Japan demand will come back.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Credit Suisse.", "Chip Dillon", "And again, we very much appreciate the new reporting format. I think this is the second straight quarter, and we look forward to that. I think the biggest question I had, just looking over the results, is trying to forecast the corporate expense line. And it looks to me from what you're saying is that we obviously would shave a little bit from this quarter. It was pretty high for the lower pension expense and I'm guessing that might be what? $5 million. And the other question is on the stock, $8 million you mentioned increase on the stock compensation, is that a number that is totally a function of the stock price or is there some fixed level that we should always factor in? So bottom line is, where do you see that corporate expense number going?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, Chip, as you look at that, you're right on the pension. And I would remind you that what's in the corporate segment is just pension and postretirement that doesn't get allocated to the segment. So in the reporting package to try to help you dimension that a little bit better, on Page 4 we give you the total company look by quarter. And then back on Page 9 in the Corporate & Other segment, we give you what portion of that runs through corporate. So that should help you with the pension and postretirement benefits. And you're right in terms of a go-forward number. It's probably $4 million to $5 million left on a per quarter basis than what it was in the first quarter. Now if you think about the variable comp expense tied to the stock, most of that really is a function of the stock price. And it runs in a couple of areas. One, we do have some stock appreciation rights that we use for our equity plans in Canada. And then we also have deferred comp that is ", "in share equivalent. The share equivalents are about, I think, roughly 1 million shares at the end of the quarter, and the stock price moved about $6 in the quarter. So that should help you dimension that movement quarter-to-quarter. And on a go-forward basis, I would say exclusive of those items, probably $10 million to $15 million a quarter in the Corporate & Other segment would be a good rule of thumb. As you know, the Corporate & Other segment is sort of the catch-all segment and it does get impacted by things like foreign exchange, stock price, et cetera. So directionally, keeping those things in mind I think will help you chart what that corporate expense will be on a go-forward basis.", "Chip Dillon", "So said differently, if we assume the stock price just didn't change in the given quarter, there would still be the pension expense. And that would be in addition to that $10 million to $15 million, correct?", "Patricia Bedient", "Yes, that's right.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. And then the second and last question is I believe I heard you say that as you forecast the second quarter for Wood Products, you expected realizations to be flat, I believe, sequentially. And just sort of looking at recent prints from whether it's the futures market or random links, I'm just wondering if that might be something that could be maybe a few weeks old or is that something that would, on the other hand, would anticipate some improvement as we go into May and June?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, we really haven't seen improvement as we go into May and June. Usually, we would expect to see some, and we held realizations flat in the forecast. As you appropriately note, in April, those realizations are a little softer. So if we don't get any pickup, then I would say that there's a possible downward pressure on the flat realization forecast.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos", "A couple of nitty-gritty questions, I guess, to start. Did I hear you say, Dan or Patty, that in Wood Products, while obviously still a relatively weak end market environment, you expected unit costs to be lower as you were going to be improving production. If I heard that correctly and you don't necessarily see the pickup, does it make for perhaps a weaker third quarter because at some point those costs have to come back to roost if you don't sell the product?", "Daniel Fulton", "Costs are coming down for a couple of reasons, George. Part of it is the higher utilization rate at our mills that is in part related to permanent closures that we took at the end of last year. So we are operating at a higher rate in lumber and in OSB, slightly higher rate in our solid sections. With respect to lumber, we got very high operating rates in Canada, somewhat lower in the U.S. But those utilization rates should be sustainable given the level of demand that we see today. We're also enjoying some benefits from reduced SG&A. As compared to fourth quarter, we brought our SG&A in the business down by 13%. So it is a focus on tightening up costs, as well as our general focus in our Wood Products businesses to work the margins very heavily and in some cases, we do have some pricing opportunity. But we've got to be working both price and margin.", "George Staphos", "Okay. That segues to my other questions. One, to the extent that you can comment -- and if you have it in the packet, I had missed it. What would you say your average operating rates are right now across your major product classes within Wood Products? And secondly, for your or for Larry if he's on the phone -- I'm sorry, go ahead, Dan?", "Daniel Fulton", "Larry's not on the phone, so you got me and Patty.", "George Staphos", "That's still good. Do you think the initiatives that you've taken in Wood and the actions that you've done to date would be sufficient to bring the business to breakeven on EBIT basis if we held prices in your major categories flat at the 1Q average, or would you need to embark upon additional actions to get to a breakeven on EBIT? So operating rates and further actions that are needed.", "Daniel Fulton", "Operating rates, let's take that one first. In lumber for the quarter, our operating rate approached 80%. In our OSB business, we were running at around 66% and in our engineered business, it continues to be in the mid-30s. As you know, engineered products go into new home construction, whereas at least with OSB and lumber, we've got some alternative outlets and potential export plus the home improvement warehouse business. With respect to the initiatives in Wood Products, we have a wide range of initiatives underway in every single one of our product lines: lumber, OSB, engineered and in our distribution business. We need to be making progress in all of those to get to the numbers that we're projecting, and we're making progress. So I'm really pleased with the amount of activity that we have ongoing in our Wood Products business to improve our competitiveness. But we have not completed the initiatives and they are ongoing and we need to continue to improve in every single one of those in order to hit the numbers that we projected.", "George Staphos", "So Dan, if I'm interpreting it correctly, your initiative would get you to breakeven on a cash flow basis but you really can't comment to whether they would get you to breakeven given the current market environment on an operating profit basis, would that be fair?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, I think that would be fair, George, to say that in our forecast, we said that we would be cash positive for the second quarter. We said that the loss would narrow on an EBIT basis, and our forecast was realization flat. So we would not be to cash -- or to operating breakeven during the second quarter but we do expect to be cash flow positive.", "George Staphos", "It's fair enough. I was looking at past flow 2Q, but I'll leave it there for now. The last question, working capital was up quite a bit in the quarter. Again around the same line of reasoning or questioning, is there a way that you can become even more cash efficient in the future, certainly you can't control that a bit more than you can, the markets are dropping and in terms of improving your turns?", "Daniel Fulton", "Working capital build that you see in Wood Products is seasonal. It is normal this time of the year that you would build first quarter. The utilization of our working capital has also improved over time. We continue to focus on increased inventory turns in our distribution business, as well as the manufacturing portion of our businesses. And I would not say that there's no opportunity there. We continue to work it not just in the Wood Products business but every business that we've got.", "Patricia Bedient", "Yes, I think as you think about working capital, especially in Wood Products, you're coming off a very low year end, the December and holiday season. So that's a good portion of that build as well and it is pretty typical year-over-year. I would say that if we had more confidence in the housing outlook, we would have built more working capital than what you see there although it is something that we monitor very closely. And we would not expect to be building additional working capital in the second quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "I just want to echo Chip's comments. I find this new layout with the results and the detail very, very hopeful. A couple of questions on Wood Products. I did notice that big drop in Wood Products SG&A, and I wondered, Dan, is that likely to go down any further? Is that first quarter level sort of the new run rate in that business? And can you tell us a little bit about what you did to bring that down?", "Daniel Fulton", "A lot of that, Mark, came out of selling costs as we looked at our business and evaluated what we really needed in operating. I would say, that there is -- that is the run rate that we've got today but we are looking for ongoing opportunities to bring it down. It was a notable change. And those were actions that we took last year in order to align our cost structure with the market situation that we find ourselves in.", "Patricia Bedient", "And a number of those costs, in addition to the selling, were actually costs that were cost at the corporate center in terms of allocated cost that historically kinds of costs that would be allocated to the segment for their use for things like IT and other services. And we have been working pretty steadily across the company to bring those costs down in line with Wood Products operating posture. So I think it's the combination of the selling, the G&A, the G&A that is direct into the business as well. And as Dan said, I think in that business, we're really trying to pull all the levers that we can.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. I will just start, Patty, when I looked at it across all the segments, that was the segment where you really saw the big decline both year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. One other question about lumber, Dan, and I think people have kind of gotten around this a little bit already, but we've seen this big drop in the lumber futures, and I wondered if you have any thoughts about what's behind that. One argument that I've heard is that the Chinese have backed away from the lumber markets up in Canada and elsewhere in the short term, and that's one of the reason we're seeing this. I wondered if you have any thoughts?", "Daniel Fulton", "We're not a huge seller of lumber into the Chinese market. We've got some production out of Canada.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "But you're a huge lumber player -- I was just going to say, you're such a huge lumber so you must have a sense of what's going on.", "Daniel Fulton", "We are. I think some of this is a reaction to anemic U.S. housing starts numbers. I mean, that's really the driver for lumber especially across the West. And in the South also. We're just not seeing the starts levels that had been anticipated as we entered the year. I made a comment that as we were entering the year, we were expecting starts at about 525,000 single-family. That was certainly not at the high end of the range of forecast. And what we're seeing now is those forecasts starting to drop below 500,000. Yesterday, NAHB [National Association of Home Builders] came out with a revised forecast at slightly under 480,000. And so I think that the Chinese demand for lumber and logs has been important but the main driver is U.S. housing.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes, okay. I wanted just to step over to Timberlands for a minute. I wondered, when we look at the details you're now giving us for the Timberland business, is there anything that you could do going forward that would give us a little more visibility inside the portion of that business that's export in terms of export volume and export prices? And it would particularly help us understand kind of how you're doing in the Japanese market because I think you sell a much richer mix of logs into Japan and say what you would sell into other Asian markets.", "Daniel Fulton", "Historically, that's the case. You used the comment, the term richer mix, and we've seen the quality of logs that are shipped to China increase over the last 12 months. Some of that is related to availability of logs out of the West. And we're working to try to improve the data that we do get to you so you have a better understanding of our business. So we'll take your question as input. And we got an Analyst Meeting coming up where we're going to talk about Timberlands and so we'll try to give you some greater visibility.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. Just one last question, Dan. Just it seems to me there are still a number of peripheral assets around the company. And just to take a single example, you've got a single bleach board machine up there at Longview. Just seems like you have to -- you have one machine in a market that you're not really in otherwise. It just doesn't seem to me that you're the natural owner for some of these businesses. Any kind of thoughts on that?", "Daniel Fulton", "The bleach board business is located in Longview. It's part of our Longview complex. And it starts to get relatively complex in terms of shared services and integration with other activities. That business is much improved, and in fact we are significant player in that market. There are only a limited number of producers of that product. We've got great long-term relationships, and we are a significant seller of that product in Japan so it's a significant contributor of cash. It's operating better than it has ever been for us. And at this point, it continues to be part of the portfolio.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, very good. I look forward to seeing you in a few weeks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "First, your comments about housing mix in the quarter and expectations that the mix will remain weak in Q2. Do you anticipate at this point that your mix is where it ought to be for the rest of the year if we don't see a housing pickup, or is it hard to see beyond the second quarter? And my second question, I was wondering if you could just give us an update on your overall energy cost sensitivities?", "Daniel Fulton", "So on housing mix, let me understand your question, Mark. You're reacting to our comment that margins shifted because of mix?", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Sure, sure.", "Daniel Fulton", "Okay. So that is a comment really around the relative mix of closings and where they came from. So fourth quarter, we would have had a higher percentage of closings coming from Southern California, in particular San Diego. First quarter, there were more closings in other markets. And so on the first quarter statement and as Patty said in her outlook for second quarter about margins, it is a function of where those closings occur. We would expect, as we have in the past, to see a pickup in mix towards California in the back half of the year. But as I reported when we talk about activity on a year-over-year basis, our sales activity is much lower in California than it has been. So somewhat of a concern as we look at what margins might be, and it's too early to tell what that would be in the third and fourth quarter. At this point, we've got a very good sense of what second quarter activity is going to be because those homes are fundamentally in escrow.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Right, right. Okay. And on the energy side?", "Daniel Fulton", "Could you restate your question?", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Yes. I'm just trying to get a sense of what your energy cost sensitivities are right now. Fuel costs are up, oil prices are up. Just trying to get a sense on both the -- whether it's significant enough for it to matter going forward in the Timberland business and also in your Fiber business?", "Patricia Bedient", "As you think about it in our Timberlands business, Mark, diesel fuel really is the biggest impact there. And it is a significant impact. If we were to take the prices that we have currently and have those for the rest of the year given where we were at the beginning of the year, it could be as much as a $20 million to $25 million impact for the rest of the year. So that's the primary piece. As it relates to sale of fibers, fuel, of course, impacts freight costs there. And then the other major impact, I would say, as you think about oil prices, flows over somewhat into our Wood Products business in terms of the cost for resin, et cetera. So those would be the major pieces.", "Daniel Fulton", "Just as a final comment, I made a note in my remarks that energy also does affect consumer confidence. The translation of oil prices into gas prices at the pump does have an impact on consumer confidence which affects the homebuilding business, which ultimately, as you know, flows back to the Wood Products business. When we get to $5 a gallon for gasoline, people start to change their habits and it makes them cautious.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Dan, you mentioned before some new products on the Cellulose Fibers side, and if I recall, you were doing something with a commodity viscose staple extender. Can you give some more details on that in terms of timing mix? How much that could potentially take out of your typical fluff pulp business and what your expectations are for those new ones?", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes. Patty talked about this about six weeks ago in a conference, and we are making a product, which has the ability to be an extender for dissolving pulp. It has a brand name called Pearl. And I think the estimate that we've made recently was that we may have as much as 60,000 tons this year. We've had very strong market response for that product. We've had a very limited number of shipments so far but we're building an order book for the balance of the year. It does give us the potential to increase average realizations across the pulp business. It's going to be a relatively small percentage of total production. But on the margin, it will give us some increased pricing power and it should benefit us. And you'll start to see that more in the balance of the year. Very limited activity in the first quarter.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Is there some rough estimate, if you get to 60,000 tons of production, about how much of that would actually take out of the existing Cellulose Fibers production capacity?", "Daniel Fulton", "Well, it's not a 1-for-1 substitution. So as we shift over to that product, we have a corresponding loss in fluff volume, slightly more than 1:1, but it is more than made up by the increase in price.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, but it wouldn't be like a 2 for 1?", "Daniel Fulton", "No, no, no. Nothing that...", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And on your Wood Products side, you touched on Japan and how much of that is actually mix of revenues. Is there -- would you be able to give us an estimate of how much Japan actually makes up of your Wood Products division itself? Or is that...", "Daniel Fulton", "It's a small percentage of Wood Products historically. They've been a major log customer. We ship to Japan primarily from Canada where we ship our J-grade product. And out of our operations in Canada, it is a small percentage that flows there. As demand may pick up for rebuilding, we would have the ability perhaps to pick up lumber exports not just from Canada but also the U.S. But primarily, they're a purchaser of spruce, and so that would be coming out of our Canadian operations. By and far, as we talked about Japan, it's a log market and it is a Cellulose Fibers market for us, both pulp and liquid packaging board.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Trying to get a handle on the potential of impact of increased purchases from Japan for your log business related to rebuilding. I realize it's very difficult to forecast especially on the timing. But if we look back to Kobe, can you give us a sense as to what type of impact that you think that that has on your log business? Did it perhaps increase your log sales to Japan by 50% versus where the run rates might have otherwise been for a 3- to 5-year period? Or how would you frame what happened in that prior situation? And if you have any perspective on how the current situation might differ that you'd share, that would be great, too.", "Daniel Fulton", "I don't have numbers on the impact on our log shipments from that period. The most significant aspect of the Kobe rebuild was that wood frame construction performed very well in that earthquake. And so following that earthquake, there was a more significant adoption of Western-style framing for the construction of single-family homes. And that's now part of their building code so that's not a barrier that we would have to overcome. Longer term, that may be an opportunity for us in China because the Chinese do not build stick frame homes. They build with concrete and brick. And so a terrific long-term opportunity if the Chinese would start to build wood frame houses. So I can't comment on the impact on our log exports. I can just tell you that we've got solid long-term customers that buy our logs, that convert them into structural wood frame products. And so we're positioned with those relationships, not only with the operators of sawmills, but also the trading companies that we've worked with over the years that to the extent that there's a market opportunity and a demand for those products, we'd be able to take advantage of that.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Maybe let me try and come out at a different way and perhaps you can provide some help. If we think about the Japanese housing market, order magnitude is 800,000 starts, maybe 450,000, 500,000 wood starts in the last year or so. If one were to make an assumption that there's going to be another 400,000 houses, but let's just say just pulling numbers out of the air, so it'd be 50% equivalent of one year. And you flow that over five years, then it would perhaps add 10% or so a year to Japanese housing starts, 10% to 20%, depending on how you calculate it. Would that translate to a 10% to 20% increase for you, or would it potentially be very different than the 10% to 20%? So the last part being kind of the question of, if we make a judgment on how much the impact is going to be on Japanese housing starts, how does that then flow back to you?", "Daniel Fulton", "I can't comment on your modeling and how you would approach it. I assume that we will receive our share of product demand for rebuilding. But remember, they get Wood Products from all over the world, not just North America sending either our finished lumber or logs to Japan. The key for us is to leverage the long-term relationships and the logistical advantages that we have and we will take advantage of this much opportunity as possible. And the timing will play out. As I said, they need to deal with temporary housing. There's about 150,000 homes that were destroyed, their focus right now is on temporary housing which is both steel and wood frame, and then they'll get to focusing on permanent rebuilding. And in some cases, some of the homes that were damaged are in areas where it's going to be a while before there's any rebuilding because they have concerns about radiation, of course.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay, great.  And then just one last real quick one. I guess I was a little surprised that we didn't see a bigger increase in the Pacific Northwest log pricing relative at least to the fourth quarter? Are those -- is that mix shifts that are offsetting what seem to have been even bigger increases by specific grade?", "Daniel Fulton", "Well, prices have been moving up and there is some mix. We also have some portion of our logs, as Patty said, that are actually sold domestically to customers that end up flowing them to Asia. So I'm not sure that I'm answering your question, Mark. Restate it one more time.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "If you look at your Pacific Northwest log prices, it was up 5% first quarter versus fourth quarter. And if you looked at what many of the movements on individual species of logs had been, it seemed to have been much bigger than that. So I was just trying to understand why there wasn't an even bigger increase 1Q versus 4Q in your average Pacific Northwest log realizations. And I wondered whether it was mix had something to do with that.", "Patricia Bedient", "So you do have some movement in mix, Mark, because Japan is still our biggest overall market. But in terms of movement quarter-over-quarter, I would say that China, which has a little bit lower price log, was a bigger -- had a bigger movement in the overall mix.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Right, that makes a lot of sense. And do the prices to the Japanese market, do you tend to have longer-term contracts that are much more stable or do they really move with the market as well?", "Daniel Fulton", "They move with the market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just wanted to focus on Cellulose Fibers just for a second. Can you just calibrate the outages in the first quarter and possibly the second quarter, either on a tonnage basis or what you'd expect the maintenance cost to be? And then I had a follow-up just on how you're seeing the trends in the fluff market and how you'd think those trends would play out through the balance of 2011?", "Patricia Bedient", "So Rick, this is Patty, why don't I take the maintenance outage question? As you think about your average outage for our mill sets, on average, they'll run about 10 to 12 days and it will be about $1 million a day, just round numbers. So let's just say that's $12 million a mill. In the first quarter, we had two mills that were down. So that would be a total of $24 million. And then as Kathy said in her comments, we did spend about $7 million in the first quarter on the outages for the second quarter, just getting ready for those outages. So that would be around just a little bit over $30 million for the maintenance cost itself in the first quarter, and we do expense maintenance as it's incurred. So as we move into the second quarter then, I said we would complete our remaining outages for the year. So that means we have four in the second quarter. So again, back to our $12 million a mill, that would be $12 million times four, it would be $48 million. And if you took the $7 million that we already spent on that, we'd be just over $40 million. Now those are for average outages. And we do have one mill in the second quarter where we will be installing a capital project. So its outages, a little over twice as long or about twice as long as our normal outage would be. So let's just say that's another $10 million. So roughly quarter-over-quarter, you're looking at probably just over $30 million for the first quarter and just under $50 million for the second quarter for an increase of a little under $20 million.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great. And just maybe just comment on how you're seeing the trends in fluff pulp because we've seen some certainly some tightening in paper grade pulp.", "Daniel Fulton", "There's been some tightening in paper grade fluff index. Prices have been off a bit. There is some substitution that's taking place where there's some fluff that is moving into the dissolving market and conversion of some machines. Our forecast that Patty provided is that we expect average realizations to be up. And that's a function of, in part, what we see as forward pricing but also there's some estimate of mix as we start to flow in some of our Pearl product.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Just on Timberlands, please. First of all, are you currently marketing any nonstrategic land or is there anything pending?", "Daniel Fulton", "We are always in the market looking at land, in large part, to improve the mix of what we've got. The nonstrategic land that we sold in the first quarter was whitewood land. And we have had a strategy of moving into land that was better suited for Douglas fir. And so on the margin, we are always in the market but we have no significant nonstrategic land parcels on the market today.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Great. And obviously, you've been in the timber business for 100 years. But now that you're REIT, do you contemplate stratifying your landholdings at the core, noncore and maybe HBU [highest and best use] categories and discussing it with us?", "Daniel Fulton", "We're absolutely prepared to discuss that. We've provided numbers in the past. If you look at our inventory, we have a relatively small percentage of HBU because we have, over time, been active in marketing HBU and disposing of it. In terms of core versus noncore. A majority of our Timberlands, we consider to be core. They're in our primary operating areas and so we don't have any significant amount of land that we would consider not to be core. But we're happy to share those numbers and we'll provide a little bit more color in May. We have done that in the past and our core lands are well over 90% if you look at our Timberlands.", "Kathryn McAuley", "I'll turn the call now back to Dan.", "Daniel Fulton", "Okay, just a final comment. As always, we appreciate your comments and questions. And as a reminder, our Annual Investor Meeting will be held at the Sofitel Hotel in New York, 9 a.m. on Thursday, May 19, and I hope that many of you on the call will be able to join us.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for this call can be found at the website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937.", "Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.", "Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q2 2011 net earnings of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Second quarter earnings include after-tax charges of $22 million for special items, $16 million for loss on the early extinguishment of debt and an impairment charge of $6 million for the expected sale of the Hardwoods business. ", "The company's cash balance decreased $582 million primarily due to debt repayment. At the end of the second quarter, Weyerhaeuser's cash and cash equivalents was $181 million (sic) [$881 million]. ", "Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes the GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussion of the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10. ", "Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment before special items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments from first quarter 2011 to second quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the second quarter refer to changes from first quarter unless otherwise noted. ", "We begin our business segment discussion of the second quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the second quarter, Timberlands contributed $112 million to pre-tax earnings, $23 million more than first quarter. Pre-tax earnings of -- were $89 million in the first quarter before special items. Average third-party price realizations rose 9% in the West, driven by Chinese demand. Southern third-party price realizations were flat in the quarter. ", "Fee harvest volumes increased 8%. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Export volume increased 31% from first quarter. Costs were higher in the West due to roads and diesel. Higher diesel cost also affected the South. Nonstrategic land dispositions were $34 million in second quarter. ", "Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Excluding a $9 million charge for the expected sale of the Hardwoods business, the Wood Products loss widened by $16 million in the second quarter to a loss of $52 million. In Q1, Wood Products lost $36 million. ", "Lumber price realizations declined 5% or $14 per thousand board feet. Oriented strand board prices fell 7% or $14 per thousand square feet. TJI sales realizations were 1% lower than last quarter, and solid section realizations were 3% higher. Sales volumes increased across all product lines except plywood, partially offsetting lower selling prices and higher cost. ", "Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $80 million to pre-tax earnings in Q2. This was $6 million less than Q1 pre-tax earnings of $86 million. There were 4 scheduled maintenance outages in the quarter compared with the 2 in the first quarter. The annual mill maintenance schedule has been completed for the year. Maintenance costs were $18 million higher due to the annual outages, and pulp production was 6% lower. Pulp price realizations increased $48 per air-dried metric ton or 5%. Pulp sales volume decreased 2% due to weakening demand from China. ", "Real Estate, Chart 10. Second quarter pre-tax earnings for WRECO was $8 million, a $9 million increase in the contribution to earnings. In the first quarter, WRECO had a pre-tax loss of $1 million. Closings of single-family homes seasonally increased 26% from 363 units in the first quarter to 459 units in the second quarter. However, closings declined 27% from the year ago quarter. Last year's second quarter benefited from the housing tax credits. ", "Average single-family prices declined 7% from $419,000 to $391,000 due to mix. Gross margins increased to 22.4% from 21.7% in the first quarter. The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 673 homes. ", "And finally, Corporate and Other. Before special items, Corporate and Other contributed $19 million more to earnings in Q2. Corporate and Other includes net pre-tax charges of $11 million related to discontinued operations. This includes operating earnings of $2 million for Westwood Shipping Lines and charges of $13 million for other discontinued operations, primarily in environmental remediation reserve for a previously divested facility. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Fulton.", "Patricia Bedient", "Dan, before you start, this is Patty. I just want to make one clarification to Kathy's comments on the cash balance. It sounded like she said $181 million. She meant to say $881 million. The cash decrease of $582 million for the quarter was correct. The cash balance at the end of the quarter is $881 million. Okay, Dan?", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks for that correction. Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Despite continued weakness in U.S. housing and the overall U.S. economy, we continue to make progress against our goal of delivering superior sustainable returns for our shareholders. ", "In addition to focusing on improving operating performance, we took steps in the quarter that strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity and announced 2 divestments of nonstrategic assets. Our overall financial performance is not where it needs to be, and we remain focused on those variables we can control to improve performance in today's difficult markets. ", "In my remarks this morning, I want to provide some context related to broader macroeconomic conditions that affect our results, in particular U.S. housing conditions and demand from China. Then I'll discuss highlights of our quarterly progress in each business segment and key strategic goals before turning to Patty, who will cover our outlook for the third quarter plus financial comments. ", "Conditions in the U.S. housing market continue to be weak. Growth in GDP, employment and consumer confidence are all necessary for a housing recovery, and unfortunately, we saw little progress during the quarter on any of those indicators. ", "GDP growth was less than 2% for the quarter, slightly worse than the first quarter and weaker than expected. Employment growth has stalled as evidenced by the recent June figures of over 9% unemployment. Consumer confidence remains weak, affected by high unemployment, increasing gas and food prices and the budget deficit debate. ", "Facing these headwinds, we find ourselves in a housing market that is no better than last year's very weak market. In light of continued sluggish conditions, 2011 estimates for single-family starts have decreased to fewer than 500,000, and forecasters are now pushing the beginning of the housing recovery out to 2012. ", "Although we faced challenging near-term market conditions, we continue to be bullish on housing demand over the longer term as the U.S. returns to trend demand levels. We're well positioned to take full advantage of the housing recovery in the U.S. as well as to build on our unique strengths to participate in the growth of global markets. ", "As I've discussed before, Asia has long been an important market for Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products businesses. China's recent dramatic growth makes this market even more attractive to us. ", "Last quarter, we discussed the positive effect of strong Chinese demand on our first quarter results, particularly in our Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments. Demand from China continued to be an important force in the markets early in the second quarter, but late in the quarter, there was a noticeable reduction in both price and volume. Some of this change shows up in our second quarter results and will affect our outlook for the third quarter. ", "Despite this recent pullback, overall demand is still higher than a year ago, and we believe China will continue to be an important growing, long-term market for our products. ", "Let me now turn to a discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter. Earnings from our Timberlands segment were stronger than anticipated as we took full advantage of the opportunity presented by strong demand from Asia. Harvest volume and prices were up from Q1 in response to strong export markets off the West Coast. Our logistically advantaged Western Timberlands allowed us to capitalize on these strong market conditions, resulting in a 31% increase in export volume from Q1. ", "During the quarter, the Chinese share of our export volume increased to 26% compared to 15% one year ago. Although we are now seeing somewhat of a retreat in demand from China from the first quarter high, our Japan market continued strong even after the tragic earthquake and tsunami earlier this year. Our Japanese export business continues to benefit from our close, long-term customer relationships, our premium Douglas fir logs and a highly efficient supply chain. ", "Despite continued operating improvements on our Wood Products business, our financial results were weaker than we expected, largely caused by continued softness in U.S. housing, which translated into overall decline in product prices. ", "Sales volumes increased versus the first quarter across all major product lines even with a weak seasonal increase in housing starts. This allowed us to reduce inventory as we produced less than we sold in the quarter. Sales volume increases were offset by lower realizations in all products except engineered solid sections. In addition, log cost increased in the West. ", "Though performance in this business is still below our expectations, we generated $23 million in cash as we began to work down the seasonal first quarter buildup in working capital. We continue to pull all levers to improve performance at today's low level of housing starts, including expanding our customer base into new geographies and markets outside of U.S. housing, while continuing a relentless focus on improving costs and utilization of our operating facilities. We remain focused on the goal of being cash positive in this business for the full year, but it will be challenging in these difficult markets. ", "In WRECO, our homebuilding business, our performance in the quarter exceeded our expectations. Although traffic was down 15% year-over-year, our conversion rates have increased, and we continued to realize strong margins relative to our competitors. 4 of our 5 homebuilders increased sales year-over-year, and the business earned $8 million for the quarter. ", "WRECO remains focused on the basics: cost, cash flow and delivering homes to highly satisfied customers. Our customer satisfaction scores, measured by willingness to refer, are among the highest in the industry at over 95% compared to industry averages of 86% to 90%. ", "The primary story for the quarter in our Cellulose Fibers business is that we safely completed 4 planned annual maintenance shutdowns with 0 recordable incidents. With our scheduled annual maintenance now complete, we're positioned to run full for the balance of the year. ", "Increased price realizations for the quarter were anticipated, as were the expenses related to our planned maintenance. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw some price softening due to a decline in demand from China, which resulted in financial results slightly less than expected. ", "The decline in Chinese demand was especially evident in decreasing pricing relating to dissolving pulps and NBSK. This decline affected sales of our Pearl product, which is being used as a dissolving wood pulp extender. ", "Finally, I want to address progress that we continue to make during the quarter to implement our strategic direction. During the quarter, we reached agreement to sell 2 nonstrategic businesses: our Hardwoods business and our Westwood Shipping Line. ", "We have owned and operated these businesses for several decades, and as we assessed our future direction, we determined that neither were core to our ongoing strategy. By selling them to new owners, we will better be able to sharpen our own management focus on our long-term strategic direction. Both transactions are scheduled to close in the third quarter, so Patty will discuss more specifics in her outlook comments. ", "Although we are selling these businesses, I'm pleased that we will continue our relationship with our long-term associates as the Hardwoods organization will continue to be a customer for our logs, and we will continue to ship products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. ", "A final element of forward progress during the quarter was continued actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position by refinancing our credit facility, repaying our 2012 maturity notes and ending the quarter with a strong cash position.  ", "And now, I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary, and then I'll provide a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?", "Patricia Bedient", "Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the third quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. ", "Slowing export demand from China is expected to result in lower sales realizations and volumes in our Western operations. In addition, we expect domestic markets will continue to soften as sawmills take increased downtime in response to weakening lumber markets, also contributing to the falloff in volumes and prices.  ", "In the South, realizations for logs are expected to moderate only slightly as those markets did not experience the run-up in pricing during the second quarter that we saw in the West. Volumes may increase seasonally. We anticipate seasonal increases in cost for silviculture and road spending in the third quarter compared to the second. ", "Earnings from nonstrategic land sales are anticipated to be much lower in the third quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in the Timberlands segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second. ", "Average sales realizations in Wood Products are expected to be 3% to 4% lower for both lumber and OSB compared to the average for the second quarter as market trends reflect soft demand in most geographies. Realizations in engineered wood products are estimated to increase around 1% to 2%, reflecting a July 1 announced price increase. ", "Sales volumes are expected to decrease across most product lines, although OSB volumes may increase somewhat. Log cost should decrease, especially in the West, and we expect to take more downtime in the third quarter in lumber due to weak market conditions as we continue to focus on matching supply with demand. We've already taken 6 weeks downtime in July compared to 3 weeks in Q2. ", "Excluding the results of the Hardwood business, we expect overall operating results in our Wood Products segment to be comparable to the second quarter. ", "In Cellulose Fibers, pulp sales realizations are expected to decrease as the pullback in demand from China continues. However, this should be partially offset by somewhat higher shipment volumes. ", "We had completed all of our planned annual maintenance outages for 2011 by the end of the second quarter. As a result, we will have a significant improvement to maintenance cost and productivity. ", "In addition, we expect lower cost for operating supplies and contract services, primarily related to the reduction in maintenance outages. We also anticipate slightly lower seasonal energy costs. ", "Although market conditions have softened, we expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will increase significantly compared to the second quarter. ", "Markets in our Real Estate segment continue to be very weak. While we do believe that markets have reached their bottom, we don't see any near-term catalyst that would overcome the continued lackluster job growth and low consumer confidence. ", "Despite these market challenges, we expect closings to increase seasonally in the third quarter. We anticipate closings of over 500 in this quarter compared to 459 in the second quarter. Prices are expected to be flat to slightly lower due to mix, and margins should remain relatively strong at 20% to 22%. ", "We expect slightly improved earnings in our Real Estate segment compared to the second quarter, and we have not assumed any land transactions in our third quarter outlook. ", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. During the second quarter, we used $551 million to retire debt, which was originally due in March of next year. This amount includes principal, interest and the premium paid on the early extinguishment. While this was a significant use of cash in the quarter, we anticipate an overall interest savings in excess of the premium by executing the May call.", "In addition, we paid $30 million of regularly scheduled debt maturities in the quarter. We ended the second quarter with cash of over $880 million. Debt maturities for the next 5 years total just over $600 million, with $200 million due in 2012. ", "Also in the second quarter, we replaced our bank credit facility, which was set to expire at the end of this year. The new facility has a 4-year term and retains the $1 billion of credit availability. We have no borrowings outstanding under this agreement, and so we have substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet despite challenging market conditions. ", "Capital expenditures for the first 6 months totaled just under $100 million, and we still estimate expenditures for the full year to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. ", "As we have previously disclosed, we estimate pension contributions this year for our Canadian plant of approximately $80 million, and most of this will be paid in the third quarter. ", "As Dan discussed, we are scheduled to close the sales of our wood -- Hardwood and shipping businesses in the third quarter. We expect to receive total proceeds of approximately $160 million plus transfer of long-term lease obligations. Total proceeds for the Hardwoods business will be approximately $108 million, of which $25 million is a note receivable and the remainder in cash. ", "In the third quarter, we will recognize a noncash pension charge of approximately $10 million to recognize amortization of previously deferred cost. ", "Upon the sale of our shipping business, we anticipate cash proceeds of approximately $53 million, and we will book a pre-tax gain of approximately $45 million. ", "Now I'll turn the call back to Dan for some closing comments, and I look forward to your questions. Dan?", "Daniel Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. Before we turn to your questions, I want to make a few comments about the current demand for Timberland, since we often get questions from you about what we are seeing in the market. ", "After several years of relatively quiet market conditions, we have seen increased interest from a wide range of investors in the South as well as the Pacific Northwest. Recent interest has come from what I consider to be traditional timberland investors, including other forest products companies, TIMOs and high net worth family interests. This year, we've also seen interest from a variety of conservation-oriented investment funds. ", "We are routinely engaged in smaller timberland transactions, normally structured as exchanges, through which we are working to improve our overall returns by blocking up land adjacent to existing ownership where we can benefit from management efficiencies. In the case of the Pacific Northwest, we're continuing a long-term strategy of shifting our ownership to land best suited for Douglas fir. ", "Our sales of non-strategic coastal properties over the last few years is a result of our strategy in the Northwest of moving out of land that was primarily hemlock and expanding our Douglas fir ownership. As an example, earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of approximately 6,300 acres of prime Douglas fir timberland in Washington that is adjacent to our own logistically advantaged holdings using exchange proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic acreage in Arkansas that closed in the second quarter. ", "We've described our long-term strategy to target profitable growth in our Timberland holdings, and we'll continue to explore opportunities to leverage our Timberland's management expertise to add shareholder value. ", "And now, we welcome your questions.", "Patricia Bedient", "Sylvia, would you please open the floor for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Patty, can you just help us to size the kind of quarter-to-quarter impact from no maintenance in the pulp business?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure, Mark. I think as we talked about on the second quarter call, maintenance costs run about $1 million a day, and we had just over 50 days of downtime in the quarter related to maintenance. So -- and we had prepaid some of that maintenance in the first quarter. So the effect is -- of the maintenance cost itself would be somewhere just a little under the $50 million number.  And then you have increased productivity, because we will be running those days instead of paying the maintenance cost. And as I said, we also have a little bit less cost in the way of operating supplies and contract services all because of the maintenance. So I think that will give you a delta.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "All right. That's -- net-net, that's a number that's going to be north of $50 million, maybe well north of $50 million?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, I wouldn't want to put a point on it any finer than what I just gave you.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. All right. That's fine. Dan, just a question about your building products business, especially the distribution business over an eye level.  And I'm just curious about how you think about that business, whether it's just a channel market for Weyerhaeuser products or a little bit more. I had heard that you've moved away from selling non-Weyerhaeuser products and have now moved back to selling some of those. So maybe you can just walk us through how you think about that business.", "Daniel Fulton", "Before we moved into our eye-level strategy, the distribution business had a much broader range of products. And as we set up our eye-level strategy and brought all of the businesses under that brand, we turned it into more of a channel market, as you note. And fundamentally, it's been a channel for our engineered wood products business. As we've evaluated that business over the last 12 to 18 months, especially in this continued downturn in housing, we have decided to take on some additional third-party distribution and sale of the products that are related to new home construction, where we can improve our efficiencies and logistics in selling those products out of those yards, where we can put them on a truck. It's already going to a job site with our engineered wood products, and it will make a contribution against our fixed cost and help to improve the margins in that business. And so what you observed is an evolution where we used to distribute a number of third-party products. And as you observed, we moved away from that, and now we are taking on some strategic third-party products, not at the scale that it used to be but those that are complementary to our own.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then my last question. Any thoughts on whether we may see significant further nonstrategic asset sales over the next 12 months?", "Daniel Fulton", "We have nothing to announce. We had earlier talked about our shipping business and the Hardwoods business. We're pleased that we found good buyers for those businesses. And we'll be closing those transactions, as we said, in the third quarter, but we have nothing else planned at this point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Dan, 2 things. I'm trying to get a handle on the difference between the fee harvest volume growth and the price movement in the West versus the South. I mean, obviously, it's not quite apples-to-apples, I realize that. But the prices in the West have moved up nicely. Prices in the South are going absolutely nowhere. Are we really just looking at a Southern market that's super badly oversupplied? Or is there more going on in your price realizations? And understanding there's mix in there too.", "Daniel Fulton", "The most significant difference between the West and the South is the fact that in the West, we have a strong export market. And so that has driven volumes in the West, but more importantly, it's driven price, Mark. So the demand -- and it's not just China. It is the steady demand from Japan. China has been, on the margin, the most significant factor, but in our export business, we also saw, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, a doubling in the percentage of exports to Korea. So that has caused price movement on the West Coast. In the South, the South is truly more dependent upon U.S. housing. And so...", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "But Dan, when I look at the data more broadly, I mean, I'm seeing -- granted stronger volume growth in the West, but volumes in the South are up pretty good too, and that's what surprises me.", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes. No, our volume was up, as you see in the charts accompanying our release. Our volume is up in the South, both on a quarter-over-quarter basis but also on a year-over-year basis. So we've had opportunities to expand third-party sales at stable prices, and we've taken advantage of that.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay. One more question and I'll be done. Just a sort of a theoretical question. How much more fiber do you think you have in your system in aggregate as the result of the reduced harvest since 2008? Dick always used to remind us that if you don't cut the trees down, they grow every year. So I'm just trying to gauge how much more fiber you've been able to accumulate over this period relative to where you might have been otherwise.", "Daniel Fulton", "I can't give you that number just because I don't have it available to me right now, Mark. I mean, clearly, we had significant deferrals, 9 and 10, because of the slow market. As you observed, our volumes have picked up. And as you note, the trees do continue to grow. And so the fiber volumes, in large part, have increased during the period of deferral. But I don't have a number that I can provide to you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Just a quick follow-up to the question about the swing in the Cellulose business. Could you give us, Patty, an idea of what the maintenance costs were last year in the second quarter, 2010?", "Patricia Bedient", "I don't have that in front of me, Chip, but we also -- quarter-over-quarter, you really have to look at how many maintenance days we had and how many mills were down and then what the nature of the maintenance was. And just by way of illustration, as we talked about in the second quarter last call, we had 4 mills down, but we had an extended maintenance at our New Bern mill because we were actually putting in a capital project. So they're really -- they're not quarter-over-quarter exactly the same and year-over-year. That's why I've tried to give you sort of the amount of maintenance days and to give you some information that would help you with that. But we don't have any maintenance left for the rest of this year.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Got you. Okay.  And secondly, you mentioned you had $34 million in strategic land sales in the quarter. What should we -- and I know they're very lumpy, but what should we, at this point, consider to be kind of a normal rate? And you can either give us an annualized number, because it is lumpy or what you think it could be per quarter.", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, we don't have a set budget for those, because they are nonstrategic land sales. As we look forward to the third quarter, I wouldn't anticipate we would have any significant level of land sales or at least at this point. But as Dan said in his comments, we are in the market all the time to be opportunistic up to -- as we find places where we can upgrade our portfolio. And to the extent that we can transact those, we will act on them. That's why they are lumpy and why they're hard to forecast. But probably, as you look back over time, excluding the large land sales like the 80-some thousand acres we transacted in the first quarter, they're probably in that ballpark of $80 million to $100 million of -- as an annual basis.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Got you. And then just lastly, Patty, on the 2 transactions we -- you all announced for the third quarter, can you give us the magnitude of the lease assumption you're giving, your obligation you're giving up, as well as sort of the maturity date of the note for the Hardwoods business?", "Patricia Bedient", "Yes. The lease obligations have to do with the ships. They're operating lease obligations, and they go over a number of years, so I don't have that number for you, Chip. Your second question was, I think, the term of the note on the Hardwood business, and that's a 5-year term.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Yes. 5 years?", "Patricia Bedient", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos", "Quick question first back to maintenance. As we think to next year within Cellulose Fibers, should there be any material difference between the amount of maintenance and downtime you take next year versus 2011? As we think longer term, obviously, you've got this change in maintenance scheduling that you're planning. But as I recall, that will tend to start helping your earnings in '13 and '14. So any details and confirmation, that will be appreciated.", "Daniel Fulton", "George, you're correct. When we met in May, we talked about our longer-term initiative of stretching out the normal planned maintenance schedules from 12 months to every 18 months, and it will take several years for us to be implementing that. That will start to show up really late 2012. But in terms of showing up in the P&L, it'd be 2013, 2014. As we take our normal annual shutdowns today, we are making some incremental improvement that help to move us along the path that will allow us to implement that change. But as you know, that's going to be several years before we see the results of that.", "George Staphos", "Okay. Dan, you mentioned a couple of times that China had slowed in its purchases of your products, whether it's timber or cellulose fiber, towards the end of the quarter. Is there a way to put a figure on what the change or rate of change was at the end of the quarter?", "Daniel Fulton", "I don't have a specific number that I can give you for that. Let me just talk about how it showed up in each of our businesses. In the case of our export log business, we were able to make most of our shipments during the quarter. And so it's more of a prospective change both in volume and the anticipated price. So we've seen some price drops for logs that are being exported. Most of that will start to be evident in the third quarter. In our Cellulose Fibers business, the most dramatic change occurred with our Pearl product. That is small tonnage for us but has been very high margin. And what happened there, it was really early June that Chinese government fundamentally started to tighten credit for businesses in China. They cut back purchases. We think that's a shorter-term phenomenon, but it's playing out in the third quarter forecast that Kathy provided. So the good news, let me -- just talking about Pearl a little bit. That's a product that we make by swinging production from our normal fluff production. And so it's not a dedicated facility to the extent that prices fall back, there's still an attractive margin, but we can swing that volume back to fluff, which is a big advantage for us. So we are opportunistically taking advantage of pricing opportunities in that product, but we have plenty of demand for our fluff production.", "George Staphos", "Okay. Last question, I'll turn it over. Your cash flow in the quarter was better than I initially thought. Nonetheless, the markets that you're in, obviously, are not giving you any favors in terms of your ability to improve returns. So if we think about the next 12 to 18 months, Dan, what do you think will be the source of the most meaningful return improvement within your business? Will it be addressing capital structure? Will it be potential return of value? Will it be further portfolio moves? Or do you think it will be on improving your operation to cost? What do you think are the most likely source of return improvement?", "Daniel Fulton", "So we are focused on improving cash flow generation from our Wood Products business. As we noted, we are in challenging markets. We had targeted that we would be cash breakeven for the year. Our focus is to continue to reach that goal, but in the market that we find ourselves, that will be very challenging. But our Wood Products business, the focus is to generate cash and to improve margins and to improve revenues. In our homebuilding business, our focus has been to generate cash through normal operations of building homes. Plus we are an opportunistic seller of land and lots to other builders. We've had some success in doing so. And we expect that activity to continue as the housing market starts to recover, and many builders will find themselves being land short. And they will need to purchase lots, and we'll have some to sell them. In our Timberlands business, we do generate significant cash there. And what we would be looking at in our Timberlands business is some market recovery, especially in the South. In the West, we benefited in cash flow because of the run-up in prices coming from the export markets. As we mentioned, that's softer now, but we would expect that to recover. China will continue to be a strong buyer of products off the West Coast, and we'll be ready to supply them. And then our Cellulose Fibers business, we have been on a relatively steady capital spend, where we're improving our facilities. Those spending initiatives have been bringing down our cash reduction cost. They have been reducing longer-term or maintenance cost, and so we will be better positioned to generate cash in the future because of those. So to your question, what is our focus, it's all of those.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman from UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Dan, can you talk a little bit about, I guess, what you're seeing in WRECO market by market? And also, on your comments about improvement in 2012, can you maybe -- I know it's early, but give a little bit of color how you might see 2012 playing out at this point?", "Daniel Fulton", "Sure. Let's talk about individual markets within WRECO. Strongest markets within WRECO have been Washington D.C. and Houston, and it's no secret why that is. It's because they have relatively strong employment. Washington D.C. went into the downturn earlier. It's come out ahead of some of the other markets. There's not a significant overbuild of inventory. Volumes are not what they used to be, but prices are recovering, and we're actually seeing some incremental improvement in price. Houston is an energy economy, and so they've come through this market in relatively good shape. We're seeing improved activity on our Trendmaker operation, both from our routine activity with our Trendmaker Homes, plus we have some product enhancements and extensions that have helped us to increase market share and increase volume. Phoenix is a market that's actually showing some growth now. And it -- once again, it's an employment story. Relatively strong employment, our activity is up in Phoenix, and we're starting to see some improvements in margins in that market. In Southern California, we've enjoyed, during the downturn, relatively steady demand in San Diego, and we've had high margins in San Diego because of our historic land position. That continues to be the case. Market's a little bit softer than it was 6 months in -- 6 months ago in San Diego, but that's more of a relative comment. We're seeing some improvement in the Pacific Northwest, which had been soft for a period of time, and that's, once again, related to job growth. So relatively more improved job picture in the Pacific Northwest related to the Boeing airplane company and their ramp up in production plus other new employment. In Las Vegas, we're still struggling. It's a tough market, but the inventory is being worked down, and we are starting to see some improvement in that market. And then the last submarket is the L.A. and the Inland Empire. I think we're doing better than others in the Inland Empire, and we're expecting that market to pick up a bit. So it is a slower recovery than what we had anticipated, Gail, but we're seeing some positive movements. And as we talked and I mentioned in my comments, we had -- 4 of our 5 homebuilders had greater sales in the quarter than they did a year ago, and one year ago, we had the housing tax credit. So that's good news. The market where we did not see improvement was Southern California and Las Vegas. And so that's the one that is our big engine, and we need to see some improvement in order to see a real significant pickup in the WRECO activity. But we've been pleased that WRECO were profitable. Our results, generally, are better than those of our peers, and as Patty mentioned, we're expecting a bit of improvement in the third quarter.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just 2 things. One, just any thought -- early thoughts on how 2012 plays out? And then a quick question on fluff pulp.", "Daniel Fulton", "At this point, we look at a number of housing forecasts. We prepare our own, but we look at others. Just to give you a range, Gail, in 2012, we have outside forecast that ranged from total housing starts of 630,000 to over 1 million. So there is a wide range of uncertainty related to 2012. We are planning conservatively on the low side and sizing our operation for a slower market, but we -- because of our land position, we're able to respond relatively quickly if we have market opportunity. So we're focused on maintaining margin. We're not chasing volume, but all of the forecast that I see, which suggests that we are expecting to see recovery to start in 2012, clearly didn't happen in 2011. When we went into the year, we were expecting 2011 to be somewhat of a mirror image of 2010. 2010 had a strong first half, a very weak second half. We were expecting a weak first half of 2011 with improvement in the second half of the year. At this point, we're not expecting to see significant improvement in the back half. And so we're planning for that, and we're focused on recovery starting to take shape in 2012. We do need to see improved consumer confidence. We need to see improved employment. And longer term, we need to have a resolution of the mortgage securities market, in particular, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick question. You talked about the dissolving pulp and a little bit about NBSK. A competitor yesterday was talking about seeing spot pricing and fluff up pretty significantly, as much as $100 a ton. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing specifically in fluff and kind of what your outlook will be over the next quarter or 2?", "Daniel Fulton", "The fluff market has been certainly more stable. The reason I talked about dissolving pulp and NBSK is I was trying to focus on the impact of China, because those products were going into China, really as substitutes for cotton. And because of steps that the Chinese government took to tighten credit, prices dropped significantly. In terms of fluff prices, Patty provided our forecast for the third quarter in terms of what we're seeing directionally. There has been some additional supply that's come on with Domtar at Plymouth and the Alabama pine facility. That's had some impact in putting more product on the market. On the other hand, the fluff market continues to grow globally. And all of our large customers are concerned about maintaining supply because they have ambitious growth plans. And so longer term, we're really positive about fluff.  And then we have some fluff capacity that's been shipped to dissolving pulp, and so we see the market stabilizing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "You had your comments about the Cellulose Fiber outlook, especially given the weakening in China, your comments mostly in late June and into the third quarter. Could you remind us how much or what percentage of that division sales actually comes from China?", "Patricia Bedient", "We have about -- as you think about our Cellulose Fibers business broadly, our pulp business, we had about 1/3 of our production is sold domestically, about 1/3 to Europe and about 1/3 to Asia.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And Asia would be split somewhat evenly between Japan and China? Or there would be a much bigger China focus?", "Patricia Bedient", "It would be -- there's a significant focus on Japan. And China would also be an important market, but Japan, overall, is a very important market to us.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So China's just going to be the biggest market for Pearl, basically?", "Daniel Fulton", "China has been the market for Pearl. When we look -- and Pearl is a very, very small percentage of our production. But on the margin, it has been a significant contributor. Once again, at the margin, our Asian sales, our pulp, both NBSK and fluff. But also Asia is a major market for our liquid packaging board, which comes out of our Longview facility, so -- and that is primarily going into Japan. So Japan's our largest market by far in Asia. We talked about Japan on the last call, because it was right after the earthquake and the tsunami, and we had, had some disruption. For the most part, all of our customers' operations have stabilized. They've shifted production between their own facilities, and Japan remains very stable for us. It's also an important consideration not just in Cellulose Fibers, but as we talk about our export log business. Once again, to make the point, China has been terrific for us as well as the rest of the industry, because it's been new demand from the West Coast. But our large long-term export market has been and will continue to be Japan.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That's helpful. But following up on Japan, have you seen any pick-up there lately just a result of some earthquake rebuilding start? Or do you think that's still going to be pushed out another 6 to 9 months, maybe more?", "Daniel Fulton", "We have not seen a pick-up yet. Initially, the focus in Japan was on emergency housing. We saw some initial disruption in our log shipments. Those have all recovered. We would be expecting, longer term, to see a pick-up in lumber exports, but lumber would be primarily going into new construction. We think new construction will be delayed another 3 to 6 months before we start to see that impact, because they are still dealing with infrastructure. They're completing their temporary housing initiative, and they will shift now to longer-term production of permanent housing. And that should benefit the West Coast markets for lumber, perhaps some panels for those that are equipped to deal with metric sizes as well as logs.", "Joshua Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And last question regarding WRECO. Have you -- another one of the homebuilding competitors, that's a partner of yours in South edge, had taken a pretty sizable write-down in the second quarter. Do you guys have any remaining exposure that or do you think that the continued settlements there could end up being an issue in the third and fourth quarters of this year?", "Daniel Fulton", "We are a very small partner in that enterprise. And we believe we're fully reserved, and we took those reserves some time ago. So we're anxiously awaiting the settlement, but we think we're fully reserved now. Once a settlement is finally agreed to, there'll be some cash implication. We built that into our cash forecast for the balance in the year. So we're not expecting any surprises at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Changing gears a little bit. I guess, via your Catchlight joint venture, you've entered into a relationship with KiOR biofuel. But can you elaborate on this relationship? I'm sure you'll be selling the biomass, and Catchlight will funnel the fuel back to Chevron. But what kind of volume is committed? And is it a needle mover? Will we see more of these?", "Daniel Fulton", "It is too early to tell whether it's a needle mover, Steve, and I think we will be likely to see more of these. So we do have a joint venture with Chevron. It's called Catchlight Energy. That joint venture has been operating for about 3 years. The initial focus in that joint venture was to combine the expertise and intellectual capital of Weyerhaeuser. If you think about the oil analogy, as the upstream provider of biomass and then Chevron is downstream in the refining business. We have, over time, looked at all of the technologies that are out there and have determined at this point that we will form more relationships with those like KiOR that bring in some unique technology. Weyerhaeuser's role in that relationship will be providing biomass. Chevron's role will be to take away the product that would be manufactured or refined by the KiORs. Because ultimately, the challenge in this business is you have to distribute it to get it to an end user. And so the strengths of our partnership are that we, better than anyone, I think, understand the upstream challenges and opportunities. Chevron covers the downstream, and we are likely to be entering into a number of agreements in what we would call a wraparound strategy, where we have the opportunity to work with those that have a variety of technologies. We think there's great long-term potential, but it's too early to tell, and I would not be able speculate at this point timing for those technologies. But we're excited to be working with something that I've been able to get funding, and we're going to try to move the dial here and develop some renewable fuel alternatives for this country.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "So we should look at KiOR something as the outsourced refinery?", "Daniel Fulton", "Yes. Not as refining. They are a converter of biomass into a product that then would go into a refinery.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. Because I guess at some point...", "Daniel Fulton", "That is a 3-step process.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "I naively thought that a pulp mill would be a lot like a refinery as well, not being an engineer or anything. Is that still a possibility? I mean, as you move more of the black liquor perhaps out of your process. Or it's good how it is where it's just your source of energy.", "Daniel Fulton", "Right now, we're using the black liquor to provide energy for our own facilities, and that is the best use. The advantage of our pulp mills is that we have zoned entitled locations with boilers and equipment that can handle some additional biomass. Plus we are located in areas where we have logistics and sourcing, and the challenge in the biomass business is really logistical. How do you gather it on an economic basis in order to get it to a point where it's competitive with alternative fuels? So pulp mills are great sources of energy. Black liquor, in the near term, is likely to be used by the pulp mill for its own energy.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Great. Okay. Well, keep us posted.", "Daniel Fulton", "The other thing that we are doing is -- where we had the opportunity, Steve -- we have some facilities where we have turbine generators that are installed, where if we have excess black liquor or biomass, we can generate power. And the amount that we don't use, we sell into the grid. So it helps to bring down our overall energy cost as well as create new markets for power.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Well, some of your friends in the -- of the timber REITs have signed some pretty significant deals for volume even offshore. So keep us posted as these things materialize.", "Daniel Fulton", "We'll do so.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier from Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "I wanted to come back, if I could, to Japan for a minute, Dan. And I was curious if you have the high-level view of how you think about the rebuilding affecting housing starts, seeing pretty modest expectations of 5%, 10% but then it goes up from there. And are you seeing any -- recognizing this could take 3 or 6 months before we get to the front end of this, do you anticipate any different types of demand, in other words, similar order patterns for logs and lumber? Or do you expect a shift one way or the other?", "Daniel Fulton", "It's too early to tell, Pete. There are a number of initiatives underway in Japan in order to position their homebuilding industry to be able to respond to the needs. And we're -- we have customers that are home builders to whom we sell lumber, engineered wood products. We expect their activity to begin to ramp up. There has been some demand on panels, often to the West Coast, more coming from Canada than the U.S. The issue on panels, historically, has been the metric size versus a 4 by 8 panel. On a temporary basis, they've been taking some 4 by 8 panels. There may be some code changes in Japan that would allow more imported product from the West Coast. Our initiative is really to be working with our existing customers. So we've got long-term relationships with sawmill operators and with homebuilders, and our goal is to provide them products so that they can participate in the rebuild.", "Patricia Bedient", "One area, Pete, that we might see late in the quarter or fourth quarter would be in the area of the plywood operations in Japan which were hit pretty hard by the earthquake, and some of those are starting to come back online now. So we would see -- it's not a huge market for us, but on the margin, that would be another area of increased activity.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that's helpful. And then shifting gears back to timber. I think you mentioned previously, I think you said that your harvest plan for the year would be up in the order of 10%. I'm curious if you have any update on that. And maybe against the backdrop of what you're seeing in the South in terms of the dry weather, increased availability of logs and the lower prices, are you thinking about throttling back at all because of the prices to defer? Or what's your outlook?", "Daniel Fulton", "We evaluate harvest levels on an ongoing basis. We talked about our second quarter harvest levels having been up. As we look out third quarter, Patty had comments in her outlook. We have had dry weather that allows more activity. But one of the problems with that weather is it's been so bad that, in fact, productivity levels are down a little bit, because it's just difficult to work in the woods. So we will continue to match our harvest levels with profitable demand. We'll gauge pricing as we look forward and move our harvest. What we do is, fundamentally, we're always looking to the future, making judgments about future demand and future pricing, and so that's just an ongoing process. And I don't have any more information for you today, Pete, other than we'll continue our normal process.", "I'd like to just close the call. We've gone a little bit long, and I'm glad that we were able to take the time to answer your questions. We appreciate all of your comments and questions. And as always, if you have further questions or comments, you can follow up directly with Kathy McAuley. I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today, and we appreciate your ongoing interest.

McAuley", "Thank you, Ashley. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for this call can be gathered at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937.", "Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.", "Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter 2011 net earnings of $157 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, on net sales from continuing operations of $1.6 billion. Earnings for the third quarter include after-tax gains of $91 million from special items. These items include: a benefit of $83 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, related to foreign tax credits; a gain of $32 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, on disposition; a charge of $24 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for impairments and restructuring in wood products. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $66 million, or $0.12 per diluted share.", "Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items. In the discussion of the business segments, I will refer to Charts 4 through 10.", "Chart 4, Changes in Contribution to Earnings by Segment before Special Items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segment from second quarter 2011 to third quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the third quarter refer to changes from the second quarter unless otherwise noted.", "We begin our business segment discussion of the third quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. In the third quarter, Timberlands contributed $62 million to pretax earnings, $50 million less than in Q2. $28 million of the decrease was the result of lower earnings from nonstrategic land sales. Third quarter land dispositions were $4 million compared to $32 million in the second quarter. Average third-party price realizations in the West declined 5%, as a weakening Chinese market exerted downward pressure on domestic and export prices. In the South, average third-party price realizations declined slightly. Fee harvest volumes were flat in the quarter. Volumes were down in the West as the Chinese export market softened. Volumes rose in the South. Costs were seasonally higher. These increases were due to road construction in the West and silviculture spending in the South. ", "Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Continuing operations in wood products lost $43 million, $10 million less than second quarter. Lumber price realizations were flat. Price realizations for OSB and engineered solid section declined slightly. Engineered I-joist price realizations rose slightly. Operating rates in Q3 were flat in lumber, improved in OSB and were slightly lower in engineered wood products. Restructuring and impairment charges were $38 million, primarily related to the permanent closure of 4 previously idled engineered wood product facilities. This was offset by a $5 million gain on the sale of properties. Charges related to the sale of discontinued operations were $13 million in Q3. ", "Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Third quarter cellulose fibers' pretax contribution to earnings was $135 million, $55 million higher than second quarter. Average pulp price sales realizations declined 4%, or $40 per metric ton. Pulp sales volumes were flat. Maintenance cost was lower and pulp production increased 13%. There were no maintenance outages during the third quarter. There were 4 scheduled annual maintenance outages in the second quarter. ", "Real Estate, Chart 10. Real estate contributed $10 million to pretax earnings, $2 million more than second quarter. Single-family closings increased seasonally from 459 homes in Q2 to 508 homes in Q3. The average price on homes closed during the quarter increased $12,000 to $403,000. This increase was due to mix. Margins on single-family homes closed also increased due to mix. ", "Corporate and other. Excluding discontinued operations, Corporate and Other was $5 million lower in Q3. Foreign exchange charges, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, reduced corporate and other by $18 million. This was partially offset by $7 million of additional gains related to share-based compensation. A decline in the company's stock price during the quarter resulted in a larger mark-to-market adjustment. Discontinued operations included a loss from operations of $4 million and gains of $58 million on the sale of Westwood and properties in the third quarter. Discontinued operations had a charge of $11 million in second quarter. ", "I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than we anticipated just 3 months ago, I'm pleased to report that our quarterly performance improved as increased earnings from 3 of our 4 businesses offset an anticipated earnings decline in our Timberlands business. In addition to overall factors affecting the U.S. and world economies, the 2 most significant external factors affecting our quarterly performance are the same as they were last quarter, U.S. housing and China. I'd like to comment on these overall themes first, and then I'll discuss activity in each of our businesses during the quarter. Following my remarks, Patty will provide our business outlook on the fourth quarter, as well as financial comments. ", "First, let me talk about housing. Three of our 4 businesses, Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate, are impacted in varying degrees by current conditions in the U.S. housing market, which I described in this morning's release as languishing. As we entered 2011, our planning assumption was that U.S. single-family housing starts would total 525,000 for the year, which would have been a modest increase over 2010 construction levels. As we sit here today in late October, we currently estimate that we'll end the year at a level of about 425,000, approximately 20% below that planning assumption.", "Long-term demographics continue to be compelling, but prospective homebuyers today exhibit little sense of urgency. This is a result of a lack of consumer confidence, continued high unemployment rates, concern about potential downward price risk related to an overhang of foreclosed homes and a desire to maintain employment mobility. ", "One last factor affecting home sales is interest rates. Because of Chairman Bernanke's statements, the market now expects mortgage rates to remain low for an extended period of time. And while low rates are generally a positive for home sales, the expectation of continued low rates give buyers yet another reason to put off a purchase decision. ", "Once a purchase agreement has been signed, prospective buyers face an increasingly difficult mortgage underwriting process that causes many motivated and qualified buyers to move back to the sidelines and wait. Our political climate has only added to uncertainty and we see little evidence at this point that conditions will improve before next year's spring selling season. ", "The glass half-full side of me, nevertheless, sees some good news on the housing front. First, although we generally don't highlight conditions in Canada, housing activity north of the border has been relatively stable at about 185,000 starts for the year. We produce for this healthy housing market through our lumber, OSB and engineered wood products mills, several of which are located in Canada. Our Canadian mills also serve export markets, particularly off the West Coast. Second, although U.S. single-family housing starts are stagnant, multifamily rental construction is relatively strong in response to low vacancy rates and rapidly increasing rents. Rental units are generally smaller than single-family homes. But for the most part, they are wood-frame construction and use the full range of wood products that we produce: lumber, OSB and engineered wood. That's good news for our wood products and our timberlands. ", "Third, inventory levels of new homes are at an all-time low, so any pickup in new home sales will quickly lead to increased construction activity. Although our forward planning assumptions are based upon today's level of starts, we have the ability to flex all of our operations as markets improve, homebuilding, wood products manufacturing and in the woods. ", "Let me turn now to China before I provide some specific comments about quarterly performance in each of our business segments. Growth in China affects 3 of our businesses: Timberlands, Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers. We have long-term experience selling products to China. Today, we sell logs, lumber and cellulose fibers to a range of Chinese customers. And although Japan has long been our primary Asian export market, sales to China have increased significantly over the past 24 months. On the last quarter's call, I noted that we were beginning to see some pullback in both price and volume from China. Those early indications of softness were realized in the third quarter as credit tightened and demand slowed. Our view is that the slowdown is temporary, and we expect Chinese demand to return and to continue to grow over the longer term. In the meantime, we should expect a greater level of volatility than in our more traditional markets. ", "I'll begin my discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter with Timberlands. During the quarter, the impact of slowing Chinese demand led to price declines. Volumes were relatively steady, but the falloff in Chinese log prices had a ripple effect on the entire Western log market. Export activity from our Western timberlands during the quarter was 40% of total volume, a split among Japan, China and Korea. Our ability to access export markets from our Western lands has long been a significant source of revenue and competitive strength and reduces somewhat our reliance on the U.S. housing market. During the quarter, we made some progress towards additional market diversification from our other timberlands. We tested sales of southern yellow pine logs from the U.S. South to Turkey and pine logs from Uruguay to China. These sales pale in significance compared to our long-term West Coast Asian markets, but they're a step in the right direction. ", "Turning to land transactions. The $28 million quarterly decrease in timberland dispositions, which was due to transaction timing, negatively affected quarter-over-quarter timberland earnings. ", "Our Minerals business remained a steady performer during the quarter, contributing approximately $15 million. We continue to receive royalties from hard minerals and from our oil and gas properties. These include both our Haynesville gas shale acreage -- shale gas acreage in North Louisiana and bonuses from new leases with shale oil potential in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale play, that crosses Southern Louisiana. ", "In our Wood Products business, our initiatives to lower costs and improve performance are beginning to show results. Even with weaker market conditions, our EBIT before special items improved $10 million over the quarter and $59 million over the prior year. As we entered the year, I told you that it was my expectation that our Wood Products segment would be cash positive for the year based upon our housing construction forecast. The business was cash negative during the first quarter due to a seasonal buildup in working capital, but we were cash positive in the second quarter and in the third quarter as we continue to reduce working capital. Given the downturn in housing that we've experienced, it is unlikely that we'll meet our cash breakeven objective for the year, but we're making progress, and it continues to be our focus as part of our return to profitability in this segment. ", "We are pushing all levers available to us to improve our performance in Wood Products, focusing on revenue enhancement, as well as cost reductions. As in our Timberlands business, in Wood Products we continue to find opportunities to diversify our sales outside North America, especially from our Canadian mills. Export represents 38% of our Canadian lumber volume. Japan is our largest export market with over 60% of export sales. Shipments to China have nearly tripled this year. ", "I noted earlier that we're well positioned in all of our wood products to meet the growing activity in multifamily construction and we're focused on growing share where we have competitive advantage based upon our products and our geography. I'm impatient, but encouraged with our progress. This morning we made the decision to permanently close our 4 previously curtailed engineered wood products facilities: LBL facilities in Albany, Oregon, and Simsboro, Louisiana, and veneer facilities in Pine Hill, Alabama, and Dodson, Louisiana. This is another step in reducing the costs associated with closed facilities that we concluded we will not need in the future based upon the pace of the housing recovery. ", "In our Real Estate segment, we turned in another profitable quarter on the strength of our single-family operations. During the second half of the year, when we normally have increased closing activity, closings were up 11% over the prior quarter while margins increased slightly due to mix. Although traffic during the quarter declined 27% year-over-year, sales increased 5% as we continued to experience higher conversion rates. Local market conditions are mixed. Our most active markets are Houston and the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. Our weakest markets are Southern California and Las Vegas. ", "The most significant indicator of market strength today is employment. To give you a little local flavor, in Phoenix, where single-family permits are down 19% year-over-year, our sales are up 42%. The longer-term good news for Phoenix is that job growth will approach 2% in 2011. And the existing home market is remarkably strong, on track to exceed 95,000 transactions compared with the prior peak of 92,000 in 2006. In Houston, where home prices are stable, new home sales are down 30% from last year, but our sales increased 21%. Similarly, in Washington D.C., new home sales activity is 20% lower than a year ago while our sales are up 23%. ", "Turning to our Cellulose Fibers segment. We continued to run well and had no planned maintenance downtime. Revenue declined somewhat during the quarter due to price as well as mix. Even with pressure from declining realizations, the overall business result was a significant quarter-over-quarter earnings improvement. ", "I want to comment on progress on 2 other initiatives in our Cellulose Fibers segment. Both are examples of executing our strategy to grow with key global customers and to make disciplined investments to improve productivity of our mills. In early August, we broke ground on our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland. Upon completion and estimated start up in early 2013, this facility will convert fluff pulp from our mills in the U.S. South into a proprietary raw material used in diaper manufacturing by a key global customer, supplementing existing production from a similar facility in Columbus, Mississippi. At our Grande Prairie, Alberta, pulp mill, we're generating surplus green electric power from a new generator fueled by a sustainable black liquor, converting an energy expense into energy income. ", "Lastly, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of our hardwoods operations in our Westwood Shipping Line. The hardwood sale, which closed on August 1, included 7 hardwood mills. Year-to-date, revenues from these operations totaled $220 million and generated a $3 million operating loss. Our Westwood sale closed on September 30. Year-to-date, revenues from this business were $180 million with no earnings. The sale of these noncore businesses allows us to focus on our long-term strategic direction. As I noted last quarter, we'll maintain a relationship with our former associates as hardwoods will continue to be a log customer, and will transport products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. We wish our former associates the best of success with their new owners. ", "Now I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary, and then I'll have a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?", "Patricia Bedient", "Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the fourth quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with timberlands. In our Western operations, we expect lower selling prices for logs as a result of a softening export market, reflecting the backup of log inventories into China. Fee harvest volumes are also projected to be lower. In the South, we anticipate that selling prices and fee harvest volumes will be flat, as those markets did not experience the same price increases earlier in the year as did the West. We expect growth costs and silvicultural costs to increase seasonally. Excluding the effect of nonstrategic land sales, we expect that earnings in our Timberlands segment will be lower than the third quarter. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales will increase from the very low third quarter level. ", "Our Wood Products business is entering what is traditionally its slowest quarter of the year. Average sales realizations are expected to decrease for both lumber and OSB, as is typical of the seasonal slowdown in the housing market. Sales realizations for engineered wood products will likely be flat. Sale volumes across all product lines are projected to be lower. We expect additional production curtailments as we match supply with demand and incur the traditional holiday downtime, especially in our lumber system. As a result, per unit manufacturing costs are expected to increase throughout our product lines although log costs should be flat to slightly down. Overall, we anticipate the loss in our Wood Products business to increase in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year. However, we expect that it will be less than the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting the improvements we're making in the business, as Dan described. ", "In our Cellulose Fibers segment, global softwood pulp demand is weakening as a result of the high level of industry inventories and global economic uncertainty. We expect prices to soften in the fourth quarter, offset by slightly higher shipment volumes. Costs are likely to be somewhat higher for fiber, chemicals and energy due to seasonal increases. We will not have any annual maintenance shutdowns as we completed our scheduled maintenance in the first half of this year. Overall, earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should be slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third. And we expect to generate another record year of earnings in this segment. ", "In our Real Estate segment, home closings are anticipated to increase over the third quarter. The fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter for closings in our single-family homebuilding business. We expect approximately 600 closings compared to 508 last quarter. Prices will likely be lower, offset by slightly higher margins due to mix. Earnings in our single-family homebuilding business should be higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. In addition, we do have some land parcels for sale that have the potential to close in the fourth quarter. However, there are none of significance under contract at this time. ", "One of our WRECO subsidiaries is a minority party to litigation relating to a joint venture in Nevada known as South Edge. A reserve for this litigation of approximately $38 million was recorded in 2008. A plan of reorganization was approved a few days ago, and we expect to make a payment of approximately $30 million in November in settlement of the litigation. ", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments starting with a special tax benefit booked in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we made the decision to dividend earnings from our Canadian subsidiary to the United States. This decision triggered our ability to recognize a tax benefit for the difference between the net amount of taxes paid in previous years in Canada, which is allowed as a foreign tax credit in the United States, and the U.S. taxes due as a result of the dividend. Given our mix of taxable income in 2011, we will carry this benefit forward and anticipate utilizing the credit over the next 3 to 5 years. The full amount of the benefit of $83 million was recognized as a special item in the third quarter.", "We ended the third quarter with cash of $971 million, an increase of approximately $90 million. Cash flow from operations was $117 million, and cash from the sale of assets was $157 million, primarily resulting from the sale of our hardwoods and shipping operations. ", "During the quarter, we invested $66 million in capital expenditures, which brings our total expenditures through the third quarter to $159 million. We expect to spend approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter, which is in line with our earlier guidance of $250 million to $270 million for the full year. We paid $81 million in dividends and repurchased just under 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $29 million, at an average price of $16.41 a share. Approximately $5 million of the cash settled after the end of the quarter. These purchases helped offset the dilution from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock that took place earlier in the year. We did not have any debt repayments in the third quarter, and we have no further debt due until next year. Earlier this month, we did repurchase approximately 12.5 million of medium-term notes due next year for less than their face value. During the fourth quarter, we will contribute approximately $60 million to our Canadian qualified pension plans. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. Although the fourth quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter, as reflected in Patty's guidance, we have made significant improvement throughout the year. We're not satisfied with our level of performance, and every business is focused on improving results in today's market. That means getting the right facility set, controlling costs and growing the top line. This morning, you've heard examples of actions and the results in each of these areas, and I look forward to sharing continuing progress in future quarters. And now we welcome your questions.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Ashley, would you please open the floor for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple of questions on the progress that you still have ahead of you, Dan. You've done a nice job on SG&A, both sequentially and year-on-year. I think SG&A is down $26 million versus the year ago quarter. Wood products are nearing breakeven EBITDA right now, forgetting about the working capital source of cash. As we think about what is possible and if we hold the current environment constant, what further progress do you think you can make on either of those line items over the next 2 to 4 quarters, say?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "As I remind ourselves internally and I remind you, our focus is to improve operations at today's level of starts. We continue to be optimistic and bullish about long-term recovery, but our experience has shown over the last couple of years that we need to live with today's level of activity. And so that's been our focus. We have, as you noted, continued to bring down our SG&A cost. That continues to be an ongoing focus. And in our Wood Products business, our focus has been on, first of all, moving to cash-positive and then earnings-positive range. And in the Wood Products business, that takes both cost management but also top line growth. So just a couple of comments on SG&A. We made progress on SG&A as we continued to make decisions such as the sale of our shipping business and our hardwood operations that we concluded in the quarter. That allows us to focus on our ongoing operations. It does leave us with some overhead that we need to address that have supported those businesses but we've made great progress over the last several years in working down legacy costs and bringing down overall headcount across the company to become more efficient in everything that we do. In our Wood Products operations, our focus across the entire system is to bring down operating costs, and that includes manufacturing, where we need and have made progress in improving the operating efficiency and utilization of our facilities. That is, in part, related to the decision that we made during the quarter to permanently shut down these 4 facilities. We believe that we can move forward in the housing environment that we have with the facility set that we have in place. And then we have a number of initiatives to grow top line. Some of that comes from increasing markets offshore, as we discussed this morning. And some of it comes from finding opportunities where we have perhaps pricing power, where we have the ability to increase share based upon the products that we manufacture, based upon the location of our operating facilities where we may be logistically advantaged to serve some markets. And as we look at the Homebuilding business focused more on mid-size and smaller builders where we can provide products efficiently and cost effectively. We're also increasing some activity in repair and remodel market, and going back into some locations where we have not been active, where we have products that customers would like to sell and where we have an advantaged situation relative to our own manufacturing operations. So it's an ongoing effort, one where as I said this morning, I'm somewhat impatient but we're making progress and it continues to be a focus and will continue to be one. This is not a process where we get to a certain point and quit. This is an ongoing effort to improve our cost effectiveness and competitiveness, and I'm encouraged with the progress that we're making.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Maybe one follow-on and one additional question, and I'll turn it over. Given the fact that you may have some unabsorbed overhead, if I heard you correctly, might we see some temporary lull in your ability to reduce SG&A, either in aggregate or within wood products?  Or do you expect the trend, without citing it in dollar terms, to continue to be positive on a sequential and year-on-year basis?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "The trend should be -- should continue to be positive, George. I can't give you numbers and you're letting me off the hook on that one. I appreciate that. But it's going to be an ongoing effort. And every time we make some changes, we find more opportunities. So I'm encouraged that the organization is involved in a number of efforts in order to both reduce costs, but it -- also I would -- I would re-emphasize growing top line is equally important.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Quickly just on Chart 1, if I look at the detail there, I can come up with effectively an operating pretax of about $54 million. And I can come up with an operating income tax when I strip  out the gain of about $8 million. And when I add those 2 together, I get to your EPS. Considering how much earnings were contributed from Cellulose Fibers, I was just curious why you actually had a benefit in the quarter.", "Patricia Bedient", "Yes, George, we did have a tax benefit in the quarter.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "But the question, Pat, I guess, is why considering how Cellulose Fibers was such a big piece of it, of the earnings?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, I think the tax benefit is a function of 2 things. One, it's -- what happens in the quarter, as well as truing up the year-to-date effective rate. And maybe the way to think about the tax rate, it's a benefit of about 20% after you strip out the discrete items. So if you were to look, for example, on the analyst package, the first page that shows the consolidated statement of operations, you would see that year-to-date we have earnings of $202 million. That's the earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. So from that, take out -- we have 3 discrete items this year. The first one would be the large timberland sale. That was in the first quarter for $152 million. And then you would add back the second discrete item, which is the $26 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt. And then you would compare that to what we actually booked for income taxes, which is right below the $202 million, which is the $52 million. And that $52 million benefit, you would have to add back the third discrete item, which was the foreign tax credit. So it's the $52 million, take out the foreign tax credit benefit, take out the Willapa sale -- the timberland sale, and then also the effect of the debt extinguishment, and you'd get $15 million. So our effective rate -- benefit rate through the third quarter and for the year is just under 20% once you strip out those items. It's really a function of the year-to-date rate plus the discrete items that are in the year-to-date and truing it up. If you need -- if you want more detail, certainly give us a call after the call's over and be happy to walk you through it.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, it was more directional.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering, Dan, in light of your comments about a poor outlook going into 2012 and it sounds like the consensus. If you can tell us a little bit more about how inventories and log decks are looking going into that year, and how tight things would be even if we got a modest improvement right now?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I'm sorry, Josh, could you repeat the question one time, please?", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I mean, in light of your comments about nobody really expecting much from building season, this upcoming spring, where do you see log decks and overall lumber inventories being? So that if we got some modicum of recovery going into the year, how much slack do you think there is in the supply chain today to respond to that?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I really can't respond to overall supply chain slack. I think you highlight an issue, which is in the industry, people are cautious. We see these housing starts at relatively anemic levels. And so the concern that you raise is if we see a pickup, and when we see a pickup in the spring, do we have the ability to respond? We've had good weather this year and so log inventories should not be a problem in most areas. I think we, as well as others, are very careful in managing inventories of finished product. And the supply chain has shrunk during this entire recession. If you think about the supply chain from the manufacturers to the distributor and ultimately to the builders, we've had shrinkage in the distribution chain. Most distributors are managing their inventories much more tightly. And so as the market begins to recover, I think there'll be tension, and it'll tighten up relatively quickly. I do think the industry does have the ability to respond at a range that is likely to occur. I don't see a huge snapback in demand in the first quarter just because I think we would expect to see some seasonal improvement, unless there were some major public policy changes. I believe that the system will respond appropriately. Builders have the ability to put houses on the ground if they have sales. But I wouldn't expect a lot of speculative inventory, and I think that the recovery will happen in a measured basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "You discussed weaker Chinese demand in the quarter and your view that, that slowdown is temporary. I'm just wondering, are you seeing any buying or inventory trends in September or October that is kind of boosting that view? Or is that more kind of a general view based on longer-term trends? And then maybe to the extent that you can, if you can talk about how you would expect Chinese demand to go from 3Q to 4Q, granted that there's a kind of a seasonal slowdown there?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We started to see a slowdown in China at the end of the second quarter. And we commented on our last call and as I commented this morning, that played out during the third quarter. Our volumes to China were relatively unchanged in the third quarter, but would expect that there'd be some falloff in fourth quarter. Most of the slowdown has shown up in pricing. And the evidence is, if there's a buildup of inventory in China, some of that is seasonal.  Some of it clearly is caused by a tightening of credit in China that has slowed construction. There are some concerns that have been raised about overbuilding in the real estate market. We have to remind ourselves that the wood products and the logs that are being converted are not going into wood frame construction. They're used for industrial purposes, but they are used for construction forms, as well as pallets and packing. Long term, our view is that China is going to continue to grow. It's going to maintain its steady urbanization, and there would be like a continued demand for wood products coming out of North America. North America should realize its share as compared to other sources, which could be New Zealand, Russia, even Scandinavia. But we've been very encouraged by the pickup over the last couple of years. We view the current slowdown to be somewhat temporary, and we're bullish long term.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just turning to the U.S. side, just following up on the growth in multifamily homes, can you give us a rough sense of how much maybe less lumber and wood products a typical multifamily home would use than a single-family homes? Is it 20% less, or 30% less?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "First of all, we have to be somewhat cautious when we talk about multifamily. So when we see multifamily statistics, they would include both for-sale housing that's attached as well as rental housing. We happen to be a builder of some for-sale multifamily, and they would be townhomes in a market like Washington D.C. But the significant change in activity that I was referring to this morning was multifamily rental. That -- in this country, that's generally low-rise. It is generally built with wood- =frame material. There's a different mix of product that are used in multifamily units. First of all, the square footage for your average multifamily unit is smaller than a detached unit. There is a higher percentage of engineered wood products and especially engineered lumber that go into a multifamily unit. That favors Weyerhaeuser Company because of our significant presence in the engineered business. And then there are also uses of OSB. OSB is primarily used in flooring, more than wall sheathing in multifamily. So you have to actually drill down into the individual products, lumber, engineered wood products and OSB, in order to establish a relative range. I can use a rough number, but it is not exact because it does vary. But roughly, the square footage of a multifamily rental unit's about half the square footage of a single-family detached unit. And I think you can roughly apply that 50% factor across the wood products consumption, but it would vary dramatically by wood product type.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess just looking out to 2012, pulp markets seem to have come off fairly hard, so it's hard to see how they might get -- be a lot better. I guess there's some question about whether the export markets would be better than they were in 2011. I'm just wondering, can you foresee within your other operations an ability to kind of offset that type of decline next year within Wood Products, Timberlands, WRECO?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We're not at a point of where we're able to make a forecast for next year's operations, Gail. And at this point, we have seen softness, as you note, in pricing for cellulose fibers products. We've talked directionally about our Wood Products business and the path that we're on to return to cash breakeven and to profitability. We don't yet have a forecast that we're ready to share for planning purposes on what we're assuming for housing starts next year. I'd like to do that the next time we get together on a call because I think it's helpful to you to understand our planning process and what we're thinking. As I noted, we went into this year and we told you that we were planning on 525,000 single-family starts. We didn't see it, but that enters into our thought process, and each of our businesses are making assumptions based upon the factors that impact them. Single-family housing starts is a big one, but also as we look at our cellulose fibers market, we're looking at global demand, not just North America, but Asia and Europe. And so it's a little bit too early for us to give you guidance for 2012, but when we get together next quarter we'll talk about our view of housing starts and how we believe that plays out and also our sense of the cellulose fibers markets.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one other one on capital allocation. I mean, given the lack of recovery we've seen to date in U.S. housing, you guys have been pretty active doing lots of little things here and there, buying back debt, you've got a little bit land, you've bought back some shares. Can you just help us think of your policy and just how you plan to allocate capital moving forward given the continued challenges in housing?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We continue to be cautious as we gauge the pace of recovery for housing. And our focus in most of our capital spend over the last several years has been reforestation and silvicultural costs to maintain the quality and sustainability of our timberlands. We have continued to invest in capital-effective projects in our Cellulose Fibers business with the goal of driving down production costs, increasing productivity from our existing mills. And that's why I gave an example this morning of what we've just done in Grand Prairie. And we've talked on earlier calls about a longer-term initiative in our Cellulose Fibers business to be stretching out our planned routine maintenance from a 12-month schedule to an 18-month schedule. And so we seek high-ROI projects with relatively quick payback that have the benefit of increasing productivity, and also they improve our environmental footprint. We've been spending a minimal amount as necessary for safety and environmental compliance on our wood products facilities. And we've been cautious in our Real Estate business because we already have a large plan position and we're well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in real estate. So we're relatively well situated, as Patty said in her remarks. We've bought in a little bit of stock. We thought that, that was an appropriate use of cash during the quarter. And we'll continue to evaluate capital allocation on a go-forward basis strategically. The one business that we've talked before about long-term intent to grow is our Timberlands business. And so that will play into some of our thinking in the future when we look at how we allocate capital.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Patty, is it possible to get a sense of sort of the order of magnitude that we might see in the fourth quarter on those nonstrategic timberland sales?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, Mark, they are lumpy. We had, I think, earnings of $4 million in the third quarter, and they were down $28 million. I don't think they'll be as big as they were in the second quarter, but significantly greater than where they were in the third quarter.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So if we used something in the sort of $15 million to $20 million as just a placeholder, that would probably get us at least in the stadium?", "Patricia Bedient", "You'd be in the ZIP code.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, all right, sounds good. Another timberland question I had, I just -- in looking at a year-over-year comparison, your log realizations for the most part are up nicely as are your harvest volumes, yet your EBIT on a year-over-year basis is down. Is that just a timberland sale issue? Or is there something else going on?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I'd have to do a little bit of research on that one, Mark, because I'm not relating to your comment. Realizations have risen in the West. They've been relatively flat in the South. Volumes can be a little bit misleading in the South because we've got more commercial thinning happening, and the commercial thinning obviously brings a lower realization than log sales. So I think I want to get back to you on that particular issue. We'll provide more detail.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "All right, that's -- what I'm pointing to is just kind of -- it went from $75 million down to $62 million, yet it looks like the third-party log sales are up somewhere in the range of about 25%, as are prices. So I'm just trying to understand what else I might be missing there. Dan, one other question on timberland, if I could. I just -- I noticed that the realizations that you get down in South America are about half of what you get in the Southern U.S. on a per cubic meter basis. Is that a mix question? Or is that just the fact that we don't have kind of developed markets down there in the way we do in the Southern U.S.?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We have less-developed markets, and we have less mature timber. It's primarily the timber itself, Mark, because we're still growing out that forest. We are converting some of that in our plywood mill. As I noted, we are finding some opportunities -- limited opportunities to export, but it is more a function of the age and maturity of our timberland in South America.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the last question I had, you really have made great progress in improving wood products, but as you noted, you're still burning cash. Is it possible to give us some idea of just the particular areas within wood products that are drawing most of your attention right now as you try to improve performance further?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We are engaged in -- we're engaged in initiatives in every single one of our product lines, lumber, oriented strand board, our engineered wood products, as well as our distribution. And so we are focused on driving down costs. Some of that comes from increased facility utilization, and we've made progress there. And then growing the top line, as I mentioned, going into some new markets. And there's also some improvement that we've made even in just increased realizations in existing markets, as we understand our opportunity to price appropriately given our competitive advantage. So we have a tremendous number of initiatives across the entire organization, both on cost reduction, operating efficiency improvement and top line growth. And our goal is that they all come together, bring us back to cash positive but more importantly, return to profitability in this business. And we're doing this in an environment with incredibly challenged level of housing starts. And so the organization is responding well.", "Patricia Bedient", "Mark, this is Patty. As I think about your question about timberlands, I think there are probably 2 primary things affecting that comparison that you went through. One would be the nonstrategic land sales, which I think, if you compared the third quarter to date of this year and last year, are down about $25 million.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's the issue.", "Patricia Bedient", "And then the other would be also some cost increases, primarily in the way of diesel fuel, which ran up, as you'll recall, pretty significantly earlier in the year. So I think the combination of those 2 would pretty much get you where you -- in your analysis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Wanted to first ask Patty about the buyback in this quarter. We haven't seen you buy back stocks certainly in the last 1.5 years or so. And is that just merely planned to offset some of the options exercises we saw this year?  Or is there something more to it?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, Chip, it might be good just to step back from our overall share repurchase and just recap for a minute where we are on our authorization. So as you said, when we came into the quarter, we did have an existing authorization that really dated back to 2008 for about $250 million. And we'd only used a small of that authorization in prior years. Earlier in the quarter, we purchased about $20 million of shares under that authorization. And when we came into the August board meeting, we terminated that authorization and replaced it with a new authorization for $250 million and then purchased $9 million under that authorization in the quarter. So at the end of the quarter, we had a remaining authorization of about 241 million. So as we looked at uses of cash, we do believe that share repurchase is an important tool for returning cash to shareholders. And as we've said in the past, we'll utilize that share repurchase on an opportunistic basis. And given the fact that the stock price during the quarter had fallen and that we had received cash for the option -- stock option exercises earlier in this year of just a little over $30 million, we believe that, that share repurchase was a good value for shareholders. I wouldn't want to speculate on the amount or timing of what we would do in the future other than to say that we will continue to use that tool opportunistically where we can create additional value.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "That's great to know. And secondly for Dan, just as you look at your house -- your markets where you build homes and just your intelligence since you guys are on the ground in so many places, we're hearing that rents are going up even where there's not a lot of job creation because people just can't afford down payments. And in that spirit, are you -- or in that vein, are you seeing new projects for multifamily construction in some of these areas where you're seeing an almost shortage of rental property with people not being able to afford down payments and needing a place to live?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "The rental market is relatively strong across the country, and it's very strong in certain major metro areas. And it's a function, Chip, I believe, of a couple of things. One is some challenges in purchasing. But I think more importantly, the points that I summarized on -- in my comments this morning, I think that people are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the signal that it's okay to go back into the home purchase market. And so there is some concern overall about consumer confidence. There's some concern in some markets about employment. I think this mobility issue is a big one where people want to maintain their -- the ability to be mobile and to take a job in a different neighborhood or a different metro area if that's what it takes. The mortgage qualification process is much more difficult than it has been even over the last 2 to 3 years. Appraisals are a challenge. Down payments are a challenge. And I think that, that's an area where we have to address some public policy issues in order to break loose a bit of activity in the system. Rents are high. In many markets, it is cheaper to own than to rent. And so people are making a choice to maintain, in effect, an option by renting before they come back into the market. We do have land that we sell to multifamily developers in some locations. So we are not an apartment builder, but where we have a multifamily land, that's been a benefit because we can sell to institutional developers of multifamily property and participate in that market.  It's also putting some pressure on labor costs because we are seeing construction labor flow to multifamily projects.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And just real, real quickly, I know that FHA loans, you can get, with like 3% to 5% down. And you think of a -- let's just be practical [ph], a $200,000 home, and you need $10,000 down. After 3 or 4 years, if you've been able to keep your job, it would seem like you've got enough money for a down payment. Am I missing something? Do the houses you sell, do they not qualify for these FHA loans? Do you have to have the bigger down payments? Or maybe you could just give us a little color on that because we could be on the verge of a turn if we've seen a number of people save up the last 3 or 4 years.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We're going to put you in one of our sales offices, Chip. Because you have a compelling value proposition. And we do sell to some buyers that use FHA financing. The challenge, quite frankly, is not the down payment. The challenge is the credit underwriting process that has become overly burdensome. And then there's a problem with appraisals because we have changed the appraisal process. It's a much more difficult one. And in some markets, the challenge is you have a willing buyer and seller for a new home, they agree on a price but the house won't appraise for that price because the appraisal includes comparables that may be foreclosures in the same metro area although that buyer wouldn't want to buy that foreclosed home. So that's one of the things that is an impediment in the system today and needs to break loose. And I think that, to some extent, the buying public is looking for the green light to go on to say it's okay to go back in and start purchasing. And what we have seen in some markets is investors coming in from offshore that are purchasing multifamily units. And I think that's perhaps flight capital or capital that is attracted to current market opportunities because prices are significantly lower than they were at the peak.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "2 quick questions on cellulose fibers. First, I know that first half of this year, I think you had about $80 million of downtime costs and then nothing in the second half. You talked about trying to change the downtime schedules going forward. Are we going to have less than $80 million in downtime costs, maintenance downtime costs, in 2012? That's the first question.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We are on a longer-term path of stretching out our scheduled downtime, as we had talked before, from 12 months to 18 months. That process will take about 4 years to completely accomplish. And part of it is we have entered into some capital projects that will allow us to operate safely for longer periods of time. There's also certification processes that need to take place for those individual mills. And so 2012 and 2013 will be bridge years where we will start to stretch out the time frame on a mill-by-mill basis. It's probably a little bit early to be giving your guidance for 2012, but I wouldn't expect that you'd see anything significantly different in 2012 as compared to 2011. This is a longer-term process that we have a lot of confidence in, but we need to do it safely.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay, understood. And then -- and secondly, I guess I was somewhat pleasantly surprised that in the pulp business you thought that profits would hold up pretty well 4Q v 3Q, given that there has been some erosion in pricing. And I guess I was just trying to understand whether there's some lag that happens in the way the contracts are set up so that some of the price's duration [ph] shows up a little later as opposed to in the immediate. Is that what's going on?  Or is it just that the fluff pulp really has been holding much more stable?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Fluff pulp has been more stable than NBSK. And we have a mix of products, the primary one of which is fluff, and it's going to our large customers. So there is a bit of a lag, Mark. Fluff prices have come off their peaks. They haven't suffered as much as NBSK. And we are expecting a pickup of some of our specialty fibers in the fourth quarter. So generally, the -- we, in Patty's comments -- I mean, we talked about earnings being slightly lower as we look forward to the fourth quarter. And we'll have to see that play out.", "Patricia Bedient", "Mark, I think there is some softening in the quarter, but as I also said, we will have some -- a little bit higher shipment volume in the fourth quarter compared to the third as well. So those 2 are offsetting each other.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And so basically, there's not a significant lag effect to be thinking about for the first quarter?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "No.", "Patricia Bedient", "No.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Joshua Zaret of Longbow Research.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "2 quickies. First, I would like to get an explanation in wood products of what seems like an unusual sequential quarterly trend in shipments between softwood lumber, which was down about 3%, and OSB, which was up about 10%. So a diverging trend. And when you add to that, I'm really curious because the OSB is -- the volume was 28% above a year ago, and I'm wondering if there's anything pushing that up like hurricanes or something that we should deduct as we go forward to the fourth quarter.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Josh, softwood lumber is trending down. That's a seasonal factor related to construction during the fourth quarter. As we look at our OSB business, we've got 2 year-over-year changes as we would look back at last year. Number one, we reopened late last year our facility at Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan. We saw very little volume coming out of that in even late fourth quarter as we brought that mill online, and that had been shut down for a couple of years. It is still not operating fully given market recovery, but there is year-over-year volume coming out of Hudson Bay that you didn't see last year. And then we have a oriented strand mill at Grayling, Michigan, and we've increased production there. We're operating 24/7 because we've got good demand out of that geographic region.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "So that's a fair level, the 549, that -- relative to demand for the third -- as you see it for the third quarter?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Can you repeat your question?", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "In other words, there's nothing unusual in that 549 relative to demand. I mean, you brought your -- housing's done nothing. You brought your demand up quite substantially year-over-year and even quarter-over-quarter.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Right. There's nothing in terms of overall market demand, but we have increased production in those 2 facilities, number one, in Grayling, Michigan, because we have opportunities to sell more product. So if you think about my general comments on wood products, we're working on driving costs down, but we're also looking for opportunities to increase top line.  Where we have a product that's competitive, where we have logistical advantage, we're taking advantage of that. And so we've increased production and increased sales. And then the Hudson Bay mill will be brought back online, so we've got increased production this year that we didn't have last year. That's a mill that we hope to see increase production over time. We're going through a process now in certification for the Japanese market that creates some additional opportunity that perhaps could come out of Hudson Bay, but it's too early to talk about specifics.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then the second quick question. In timberlands, the margin for the segment really took a dive to 23%. It's typically in the 30% to 40%. Can you confirm that, that's overwhelmingly due to the less nonstrategic timberland sales and not to the other cost issues that you have mentioned?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "There have been slightly higher costs. Some of that is related to fuel. There was a drop in realizations, modest -- just because in the West as we talked about the Chinese market slowing down and the impact on pricing. And then the big factor in the quarter was the land dispositions.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Would the land -- the land -- I mean, the lack of land dispositions for the -- this quarter. But would that be the biggest factor, the lack of land sales in driving that down? Or would it be...", "Daniel S. Fulton", "That was the biggest factor in the quarter. Okay. So I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We always appreciate your comments and your questions. We invite you to follow up after the call with Kathy McAuley and she'll be able to answer follow-on questions.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. McAuley, you may begin your conference.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides of this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937. Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. Joining me this morning is Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. As summarized on Chart 1 on the package, this morning, Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter 2011 net earnings of $65 million or $0.12 per diluted share. Our net sales from continuing operations of $1.6 billion. Earnings for the fourth quarter included net after-tax charges of $12 million for restructuring and asset impairments. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $77 million or $0.14 per diluted share. ", "For the full year 2011, the company reported net earnings of $331 million or $0.61 per diluted share and net sales from continuing operations of $6.2 billion. A GAAP reconciliation on special items can be found on Charts 2 and 3. In the following discussion of the business segments, I will refer to Charts 4 through 10. ", "Turning to Chart 4. This illustrates the change in contribution by business segment from third quarter 2011 to fourth quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the fourth quarter refer to changes from the third quarter unless otherwise noted. We begin our business segment discussion of the fourth quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. ", "Timberlands contributed $70 million to pretax earnings, $8 million more than Q3. Earnings from the disposition of nonstrategic timberlands increased $17 million to $21 million. Fee harvest volumes rose 2% in the West and 5% in the South. Log prices declined 4% in the West, due to weaker Chinese demand. Log prices were slightly higher in the South. Road and silviculture costs were seasonally lower, fuel costs were higher. ", "Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. In the seasonally weak fourth quarter, Wood Products lost $61 million, $18 million more than in Q3 but less than in the fourth quarter of 2010. Sales volume seasonally declined. Lumber, 8%; oriented strand board, 6%; and engineered Wood Products, 12%. As illustrated on Chart 8, price realizations for most products were lower. Lumber and oriented strand board prices decreased 2%; engineered solid section prices declined 4%, and engineered I-Joist prices were 1% lower. ", "Operating rates were lower in response to weaker market demand. Downtime across all product lines increased from 12 weeks in Q3 to 47 weeks in Q4. Unit manufacturing costs were higher due to market downtime. ", "Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. The pretax contribution to earnings in fourth quarter was $134 million, $1 million less than in Q3. Average pulp price realizations declined 3% or $25 per air-dried symmetric ton. Pulp sale volumes increased 10%. There were no annual maintenance outages in the quarter. ", "Real Estate, Chart 10. Real Estate contributed $41 million to pretax earnings, $31 million more than in third quarter. Earnings were also higher than in Q4 2010. Single-family home closings seasonally increased 15% from Q3 to 582 homes. Year-over-year closings declined 4%. The average price on homes closed decreased $5,000 from the third quarter. This reduction was due to mix. ", "The single-family gross margin was 25.4%, an increase from 23% in Q3, but lower than the gross margin of 26.1% in the year-ago quarter. Land sales contributed $19 million in earnings. ", "In Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other was $6 million lower in Q4. Gains on foreign exchange were more than offset by increased charges for share-based compensation and other items. ", "I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Despite continued economic challenges, our company took full advantage of every opportunity to improve our overall performance during the last quarter and the entire year, and I'm pleased with our overall results. ", "In my remarks this morning, I'll provide some highlights of our fourth quarter results for each business segment, as well as observations on overall performance for the year. I'll also provide my perspective for the year ahead. Patty will then present our first quarter outlook as well as financial highlights, and then I'll add a few more remarks before turning to your questions. ", "First, before commenting on the fourth quarter, I want to set the context for the full year 2011. As we entered the year, I told you that we were basing our plans for the year on an assumption that we would begin to see some recovery in U.S. housing, we targeted a level of 525,000 single-family housing starts, which would have been an 11% increase from the 2010 level of 471,000. Unfortunately, we never experienced the eagerly awaited spring selling season. And single-family starts ended the year at 429,000, even lower than 2010 and 18% short of our forecast. ", "Offsetting this negative drag from lower-than-anticipated housing activity was the continued positive strength in our Cellulose Fibers markets for most of the year, plus increased opportunities for log exports to China during the first part of the year. ", "The other major surprise during the year was the devastating earthquake and tsunami which hit Japan on March 11. Though we suffered immediate short-term disruption to our export sales of logs, lumber and cellulose fibers, we were able to work through this extreme upset condition with minimal impact. This was mostly due to the extraordinary efforts of our team in Japan, which worked so effectively to meet the needs of our customers. ", "Now let's shift to a discussion of the accomplishments of each business segment in the past year. In Timberlands, the stronger export markets for the year helped to offset continued weakness in U.S. demand. We fully leveraged our long-term export relationships and our logistically advantaged Western Timberlands to use these markets to increase earnings over last year. ", "Harvest levels for the full year increased 19% in both the West and the South. Increases in the West were primarily related to increased export sales, while increases in the South were primarily the result of increased emphasis on third-party sales. ", "Log exports are an integral part of our Timberlands business, providing valuable market diversification. In 2010, exports represented approximately 60% of our third-party sales volume from our Western lands. We spoke throughout the year about the significant impact of increased demand for logs from China. We were able to quickly respond, as this opportunity emerged, using all of our competitive strengths in the log export market, including harvesting, hauling, board access, and sales and marketing relationships. ", "While maintaining historic volumes to our largest long-term customers in Japan, we added additional volume to meet increased China demand, resulting in a slight shift in mix among our Asian markets. In the fourth quarter, export volume decreased from the third quarter as a result of an anticipated slowdown on exports to China. For the full year, however, overall export volume was up, coupled with an increase in realizations. ", "In addition to log sales, we generate income from our lands from a variety of sources, including mineral rights, recreational leases and biomass. Our minerals revenue was lower in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. Production levels of natural gas dropped in response to lower prices. Reported revenue from lease fees declined as fees collected in prior years were fully amortized. ", "Turning to Wood Products, a business that was challenging enough before the 2011 slowdown in housing. We maintained our focus on using all available levers to improve cash flow and profitability. In the seasonally slow fourth quarter, we experienced soft market conditions with lower prices and reduced volumes. We responded by taking more market downtime. ", "For the full year, taking into consideration adverse market factors, we improved performance in areas that we can control. For the year, we were able to offset the significant negative effect of lower prices and higher log and freight costs with performance improvements in a number of areas across our business. Our ongoing improvement efforts reduced manufacturing and related costs over $100 million, and we reduced SG&A by nearly $60 million. ", "In addition to our focus on reducing costs and selectively increasing price for certain products, we added new customers. We also expanded our sales in select geographic markets, including sales of Canadian lumber to meet growing Chinese demand. ", "In Real Estate, we continue to pursue our strategy as a regional builder and land developer, adapting to individual market conditions and diverse customer needs. For the second consecutive year, was profitable, which is strong performance relative to our competitors. Despite a decline in closings for the year, consistent with the overall market decline, our strong margins held firm helped by mix. ", "In the fourth quarter, traditionally our strongest, as homes sold earlier in the year are delivered to customers, we had profitable quarter that included earnings from both home closings and land sales. Land sales historically represent about 10% of our total Real Estate revenues though timing throughout the year can be a bit uneven. In the fourth quarter, land sales represented a higher percentage of our revenue than normal, but were in line with our historic averages for the full year. ", "During the quarter, we experienced lower traffic year-over-year, but conversion rates of perspective buyers improved. As we approached year end in November and December, we had an encouraging pickup in sales, about a 5% increase over the same period last year. This positive momentum is carried into the new year, as sales for the first 5 weeks of the year are up an average of 16% over last year. ", "Though individual market conditions vary, that 5 weeks does not establish a longer-term trend, maybe we're beginning to see some green shoots in the market for new homes. ", "In Cellulose Fibers, as expected, we experienced slowing conditions during the fourth quarter as market inventories increased and prices came under pressure. Our realizations were down, which was offset with increased volume, resulting in earnings approximately equal to our strong third quarter. ", "For the full year, this marks the second consecutive year of record earnings for Cellulose Fibers, a strong performance given more challenging market conditions. All products contributed to this success as we maintained our focus on operational excellence, product innovation and meeting the needs of our customers. ", "Before turning the call over to Patty, let me provide some context for our outlook for the upcoming year. As we entered 2012, we still face an uncertain environment. December's reported unemployment level improved slightly over one year ago, so we're moving in the right direction, but progress is slow. This morning's report shows some additional slight improvement. ", "Consumer confidence is still very weak and though somewhat improved at year end, it is still languishing near the low levels seen in 2008 and 2009. Uncertainty about the pace of housing recovery is still high. Structural issues in the mortgage market are not resolved, and the direction of prices is not clear. ", "The good news on the housing front for me is that the Fed clearly is now engaged on this issue. This may generate some increased attention to the critical role that housing must play in the overall recovery of our national economy. ", "With this backdrop, we're basing our 2012 plans on 665,000 total housing starts, 455,000 single-family, which is a modest 6% increase over 2011 plus 2,000 -- 210,000 multifamily. We consider this to be a conservative assumption, and there are certainly some who are more optimistic. Given our experience in 2011, we're planning cautiously while being prepared to flex up if we have the opportunity. ", "For Timberlands, we're planning to increase harvest levels approximately in line with our forecasted increase in housing starts. Most of this increase will occur in the South, where we also had an increase in third-party sales. In 2012, we continue to play to our strength in export markets, plus take advantage of opportunities for other revenue, including minerals and biomass. We expect natural gas prices to remain low, but we had some opportunities in the Tuscaloosa Basin Shale oil play where we leased land in 2011 for exploratory activity. ", "With respect to biomass as a renewable fuel, we're position to respond to market demand in the U.S. as well as overseas if public policy supports this renewable fuel resource. ", "In Wood Products in 2012, we'll focus on continued improvement to reduce cost and increase revenues, introducing new products, funding our customer base and improving our relative competitiveness. As market conditions improve, we have the production capacity to respond quickly to meet customer needs. ", "In WRECO, we expect to increase volume at pace with the overall housing recovery, but we believe that public builders such as ourselves have an opportunity to increase share over the next several years given our land base and our access to construction capital. We'll anticipate what today's homebuyers want and respond quickly with appealing new homes in great communities, leveraging our regional value propositions and industry-leading customer satisfaction. As the market begins to pick up, our land position gives us the capacity to increase home production, plus we're poised to sell desirable lots to land short builders as part of our long-term strategy. ", "In Cellulose Fibers, we'll continue to focus on what we consider the basics: Continuously improving manufacturing excellence; carefully targeting capital expenditures to lower costs and increase volume; and developing innovative new products to meet the needs of our strategic, growing global customers. ", "And now I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook, as well as provide financial highlights. Patty?", "Patricia Bedient", "Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the first quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. ", "In the West, fee harvest volumes will likely increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. We are expecting a higher mix of logs to Japan versus China, which should result in a higher sales realization for export logs as our Japanese customers buy our premium-grade logs. Domestic log prices in the West are anticipated to decrease slightly. ", "Dan mentioned earlier that fee harvest volumes in the South are projected to increase for the full year of 2012 compared to 2011. However, fee harvest volume in the first quarter should be similar to the fourth quarter, as typically the first quarter is seasonally our lowest volume quarter. Prices will likely be flat quarter-to-quarter, although we anticipate a slightly positive mix variance. Costs are expected to increase due to higher silvicultural spending in the South, and diesel fuel costs will likely be higher across our geographies. ", "Nonstrategic land sales are expected to be lower compared to the fourth quarter, but the timing of these sales is often difficult to forecast. Excluding the effect of nonstrategic land sales, overall Timberland earnings in the first quarter are expected to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. ", "In Wood Products, lumber prices are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth. Oriented strand board pricing is anticipated to increase over 5%. However, pricing for both product lines is anticipated to be lower than the first quarter of 2011. Volume for both product lines should be -- should increase over 5% compared to the first -- compared to the fourth quarter. ", "Engineered Wood Product prices are anticipated to be relatively flat, while volumes are expected to increase. Log costs in the South and Canada are expected to be higher, offset by lower log costs in the West. Operating rates will likely be higher across all product lines as manufacturing resumed to normal operations after the market and holiday downtime in the fourth quarter. ", "As is typical of the first quarter, we anticipate a seasonal working capital build, and we will continue our sharp focus of matching supply with demand. We expect that our loss in Wood Products will narrow in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and be similar to the first quarter of 2011. Lower prices and higher freight costs compared to Q1 2001, are anticipated to offset our improving sales volume and operating rates. ", "In Cellulose Fibers, we expect significantly lower realizations for pulp in the first quarter, driven by the continued economic uncertainty in global markets and high inventories worldwide. Shipment volumes are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth. This quarter, we will also have increased maintenance cost and lower production as a result of more scheduled annual maintenance compared to the fourth quarter, when there were no scheduled maintenance outages. We expect cost for chemicals, fuel and energy to be higher due to the planned outages. Also, fuel and energy cost will increase due to the winter season. Overall, we expect to considerably lower earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment in the first quarter compared to the fourth. ", "In our Real Estate segment, the first quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year for home closings. In addition, we continue to battle the headwinds of continued challenging economic conditions and mortgage qualification hurdles for home buyers. We expect approximately 360 single-family home closings compared to 582 in the fourth. Prices are expected to be lower, with margins in the high teens, down from margins of 25% in the fourth quarter due to a shift in market and product mix. ", "On the encouraging sign, as Dan mentioned, we have seen stronger sales during the month of January compared to last year, but these will not affect first quarter earnings as the closings for these sales would typically occur later in the year. Excluding any earnings from potential land sales, we expect a loss in our Real Estate segment in the first quarter. ", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had cash of $953 million. Debt declined to under $4.5 billion as we reduced debt by over $30 million during the fourth quarter. Our total debt maturities over the next 5 years are approximately $600 million, with about $188 million of that due in 2012. ", "In addition, we have a $1 billion credit facility that has no borrowings outstanding. So as a result, we continue to have solid liquidity. The underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement plans increased by approximately $540 million compared to this time last year. This was largely due to changes in actuarial assumptions, the largest of which was the lowering of the discount rate. ", "For example, in our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is our largest plan, the discount rate decreased by 90 basis points and is now at 4.5%. Reductions in future benefit payments as a result of planned amendments to our other postretirement benefit plans decreased the overall liability. ", "Based on the funded status of our U.S. qualified pension plan, as of yearend 2011, we estimate that we will have a cash contribution of up to $60 million. This payment is not due until September of 2013. No cash contribution was required for this plan in 2011. Contributions in 2012 for the remaining plans, which include our Canadian registered pension plans, our nonqualified pension plans, as well as other postretirement benefit payments, will be similar to the amounts contributed in 2011 for a total of approximately $140 million. ", "During 2011, we had capital expenditures of approximately $240 million. During 2012, we expect to spend in the range of $260 million to $290 million. ", "Now I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. As I conclude my remarks this morning, I'd like to end where I started. I'm pleased with our performance in the context of the challenging market conditions that we faced in 2011, but I'm not satisfied. Given the level of uncertainty in our markets, for 2012, we're planning conservatively while maintaining readiness and looking forward to the opportunity to flex up to meet increased demand. All of us in Weyerhaeuser are committed to taking full advantage of every opportunity to improve our overall performance and to safely deliver the sustainable results that you expect and deserve. ", "And now we welcome your questions. Kathy?", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Carrie, would you please open the floor for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "In Wood Products, your initial goal last year was to be cash positive, and obviously, the market became much more challenging later in the year. Can you share with us how you're thinking about the Wood Products business reaching cash flow positive or being operating income positive in 2012?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Yes, Anthony. As you note, we ended up in 2011 encountering a more difficult market than 2010. Nevertheless, we made a significant number of improvements, as I noted, throughout the year, both in improving operating costs as well as reducing SG&A, which helped to offset declines in prices and increases in costs such as logs and freight. As we look forward into 2012, we continue the ongoing improvement efforts in every single one of our businesses. As I noted, we're focused on improving revenues where we have the opportunities to obtain higher prices for certain products. We're adding new customers. Our efforts in terms of cost reduction, touch every single one of our operating businesses, lumber oriented strand board, engineered Wood Products, and distribution. And at this point, given our outlook for housing at the level that we are projecting today, we have an expectation that for the full year, we would be EBITDA positive and cash flow neutral. We continue to, as I noted in my remarks, use all levers that we have. I'm encouraged by the improvement and our focus continues to be to improve profitability at today's level of starts and then be able to take advantage of the upside leverage that comes with an improving market.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just a question on capital expenditures. I think on the last call, you had guided to about $100 million in the quarter, which would've brought you kind of closer to that $250 million to $270 million range that you had earlier guided to. And I guess you ended up a little bit short of that. And I was just wondering if you could give us any color on any projects or investments that, maybe, you've slowed back or pushed back a little?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "It's fundamentally timing difference, Anthony. We haven't changed the scope of the products or the projects. As we move into 2012, our CapEx continues to include reforestation expense, road work in the woods in order to open up lands for harvest. And the most significant capital expenditures continue to be in our Cellulose Fibers business, where we focus our improvements on projects that reduce costs, that have added benefit, in many cases, of improving volume and continue to move us forward towards a maintenance schedule in our Cellulose Fibers facilities where we will be stretching out our -- what has been our annual maintenance over the next 2 to 3 years to an 18-month schedule.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "First question is on the -- if you could just give us a roadmap to think about pulp or, I'm sorry, for the Cellulose business this year. Especially given the downtime, I know you normally, I believe, have that heaviest in the second and the third is sort of when you let it rip, so to speak. And should we see similar pattern this year? And, I guess, if you look at last year, the profit sequentially in the first were off about 38% without the prices falling, so I would guess you're expecting it to be a deeper drop in the first quarter this year even though we're seeing signs of it turning up later. Could you -- if you could comment on that as well, I'd appreciate it.", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure, Chip. If you compare the first quarter of this year to the first quarter of 2011, the mills that will be taking their annual outages will be similar. But the length of the outages is going to be somewhat extended, both to allow us for some completion of some capital projects, but also positioning those mills for an 18-month frequency between the plan to shut down. Now the benefit of that increased frequency will actually start to accrue in 2013. But we're setting those mills up to be in a position to do that as we take their annual maintenance shutdowns this year. So we'll have a little bit longer outages and do a little more maintenance work to prepare for that in addition to the capital project. So I would estimate that the actual maintenance spend for the quarter will be about $25 million to $30 million. Then if you factor in the lost productivity and the additional costs for chemicals, energy and fuel, I'd expect that the total dollar impact of the outages would be on the order of $45 million to $50 million. And then as you referenced, the other major difference quarter-over-quarter in the results will be lower pulp realizations, which is also likely to be around $45 million, coupled with the realizations and also a little slightly lower volume. And then we'll have some seasonally higher input costs as well. So I think that will help you dimension the change from the fourth quarter to the first. And in terms of our maintenance schedule for 2012, we had completed all of the maintenance in 2011 by the end of the second quarter. And I think our schedule actually calls for a little bit of maintenance also coming in, in the second half as those mills just change a little bit. But for the first quarter, they are very similar to last year in terms of the operations itself.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. And a quick follow-up, Patty, you gave a great rundown on the pension funding situation. Could you let us know how the expense change will be at least from a GAAP book basis from '11 to '12?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure. You know, Chip, I think just to reiterate, maybe if you could look at the cash flow statements that we have in the analyst package. So on Page 3, we break out in the cash flow from operations on 2 separate line items the impact of cash contributions, as well as the non-cash charge that goes through the income statement for pension and other postretirement benefits. So let me just start with the cash impact to reiterate that. So I'm looking at the line item, which is 2 lines up from net cash from operations, and it's titled Pension and Postretirement Contributions. So you see that we had $143 million that we contributed in 2011. We would expect that those contributions for the plans that I mentioned in my remarks would be similar in 2012 or about $140 million. Now that doesn't include the U.S. qualified pension plan, which did not have a contribution due in 2011. Based on the funded status at the end of this year, we would estimate that the cash contribution would be about $60 million, and we would not need to make that contribution until September of 2013. We certainly have the discretion to make it earlier if we want, but it's not due until September of 2013. Now let me address your other question, which is the difference in the book expense on a GAAP basis. So if you go a little further up the page from where we were before, you'll see a line item called Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits under the Non-cash Charges to Income. So in 2011 for the full year, that number was $81 million. The comparable number for 2012 is about $115 million. Offsetting the $115 million though, we will have amortization of the changes that we made in some of our postretirement benefit plans at the end of the year. So we made some amendments to those changes or to those plans, and we'll be amortizing those in 2012, and that will just about offset that $115 million. But, I think it's a little more than $115 million. But they just about offset each other. We will call those out as special items in 2012, but that's the way that the expense will flow through the income statement.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just on pulp realizations for a moment. Patty, that was just very helpful guidance. I'm just wondering what you're expecting to recognize in the first quarter. Do you think that would represent a trough or would you expect kind of further erosion as contracts recognize pricing that's already been published?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, as prices came down through the fourth quarter and certainly softened into the first quarter, but we would expect that they are pretty much at a bottom at this point, and wouldn't expect further erosion coming out of the quarter.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And would you be seeing any signs that the markets could recover over the next quarter or 2? Or do you think it could stay at this level for a while?", "Patricia Bedient", "That's really hard to speculate. We usually just limit the guidance to the first quarter in terms of the outlook. But I think, we have, as I said, starting to see some stabilization in that pulp price.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you give us a little bit of color, that pickup that you're seeing in housing activity so far this year? Is that any different as across the regions than what you operate or is it pretty broad-based?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Could you ask it one more time? I've got a little bit of a bad connection with you.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sorry. The improvement you're seeing in your Homebuilding business so far this year, is that -- any differences in what you're seeing in trend across the various regions or is it pretty universal?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, it does vary by region. And as I noted in my comments, it's a little bit difficult to extrapolate from 5 weeks. However, I've made a point, a number of years in the past, that we normally don't see a pickup in housing until after the Super Bowl. So it's actually encouraging that we've got some increase in activity during January. We're seeing more strength in the Phoenix market, in the Pacific Northwest. Texas continues to be very strong. We've seen a little bit of softening in the Washington D.C. area, which was stronger during 2011. And in Las Vegas, we're still relatively challenged. We're seeing a bit of a pickup in all of Southern California, with the exception of LA County. So it's a bit mixed, but for the first 5 weeks overall, we're encouraged. That mix will translate to differences in margins as we go forward. So last year, we did have increased sales in all of our markets with the exception of Nevada and California. And California especially is our strong margin market, and so that's some of the mix change that Patty's talking about as she provides an outlook for the first quarter. So we're encouraged and we'll track it through the balance of the quarter and look forward to on the next call being able to update you.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last super quick question. Patty, can you give a little guidance on the tax rate in the first quarter and for 2012?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure. I think the way to think about the tax rate, Gail, is really it's not only just the rate but, it's also the mix of income between the REIT and the TRS. So as you think about our Timberlands business, most of that income is at the REIT, so no tax would be applied to that. And then for the TRS, the income which also would include not only the TRS businesses but also the interest expense, you would think about a tax rate of around 35%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Patty, can you talk -- just following-up on the head tax rate question. Can you give us a little color on tax rate in the fourth quarter?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure. As you think about the rate itself, there's a couple of things impacting that fourth quarter. So one, of course, is the mix of income that I just mentioned. We actually also had a special item that we exclude as we talk about our results. So for the full quarter, quarter 4, we actually had a tax benefit of about $10 million. And most of that was a result of the special item of $19 million, tax-affected would be around $7 million or $8 million. So most of that is the result of that additional benefit, that when we talk about our earnings, we exclude as a special item. Then if you think about the mix of income, as I talked about before for the quarter, and this doesn't work exactly perfectly, but if you looked at Chart 1, for example, you'll see that our earnings, pretax earnings before special items was about $160 million. You subtract from that the Timberlands earnings of $70 million and also subtract from it the interest expense of $88 million, and you get just about a push for the quarter. And then also at the fourth quarter, you have a little bit of true up not much running through the quarter. So basically, we ended up with a small benefit of about $3 million from continuing operations.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. Dan, a second question. Just in Wood Products, is there -- are there particular segments in the Wood Products business that you would regard as sort of the biggest challenges for you in getting to cash breakeven? Or is it really just kind of a question of better volume across the whole system?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "The markets to which our products flow has some impact on this, Mark. So lumber, where we have the broadest set of markets, it certainly flows into new home construction, but it's also runs to the repair and remodel market. And so we are less dependent on single-family new home constructions. Our oriented strand board product is used in new home construction but also some portion of that runs through the repair and remodel market. And then when you go to engineered Wood Products, that has a lot heavier concentration in new home construction. And so our challenges for Engineered Wood Products, which also I would couple that with our distribution business, because there's a good portion of our engineered material that flows through our distribution business is reliant on a recovery in new home construction. And so if you look at our utilization rates across our facilities, they are the lowest in engineered, they are higher in OSB, and then they're the highest in lumber. Lumber also has the benefit of being able to flow to offshore markets, and there's a portion of our Canadian lumber that goes to Japan and recently China. So we will be recovering more quickly in lumber. OSB would follow on, and then I would say our Engineered Wood Products in our distribution. In our Distribution business, we picked up distribution of some third-party specialty products, they bring on some additional margin contribution, and so we're pleased with our progress there. I would say overall, once again, our goal is to get the cash breakeven with the level of starts that we have, but we have a tremendous amount of operating leverage as the market starts to recover. And this business in a recovering housing market will have the benefit of increased cash flow and in ultimately earnings.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. I think it actually would be helpful in May when you're out here if we could give a little more color on sort of what the footprint looks like in distribution now because I know you've made some changes over the last several years. Last question I had just on the housing market, you mentioned California being the strongest margin area for you typically. Can you give us some sense of how much of that is a question of just sort of the types of homes you're building, the size of homes, and how much of that might just be from the maybe a little cost land basis in California?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "It is both, Mark. So California is a big state, and so we have to look at submarkets within California. Our strongest position historically with respect to earnings and margin is San Diego. San Diego, we're now the largest builder. And so we build a higher-end house that has a lot higher price point, and the margins in those homes are much higher in part because of the product that we're building, the neighborhoods in which we're building, and to some extent, our land basis. The lower margin portion of the market would be the Inland Empire, with LA County being about in the middle. So there's a significant impact on our margins overall. If San Diego was strong, and San Diego was stronger in 2011 -- I'm sorry, 2010 as compared to 2011. Now in the first 5 weeks, we're seeing sales up in San Diego, that's a real positive and we've got a strong land position from which to build in San Diego. The other high-margin market for us historically has been the Virginia and Maryland suburbs, Washington D.C. It's also a higher price point in product, and the margins there are fundamentally related to the homes that we're building in the price point rather than a low-land basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just want to continue on WRECO. Dan, as you think about, are there any regions where even if you do like your land basis around the country, where you are perhaps maybe less advantaged or have less ability to flex if, in fact, the market recovers more than you expect? And a related question, if I look back at the fourth quarter, your ratio of closings relative to your backlog coming into the quarter is a little bit higher than it normally would be. It's usually 90%, but a little bit higher than that. Does that have any impact on your ability to grow with the market, at least early on in 2012?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Let me first address the question of our land position. As we've talked about this in the past, we have a relatively long land position as compared to many other public builders. And in large part, it's related to our value proposition and the markets in which we operate. So we generally would have a longer land position in a market that is more challenging for entitlements processing, and we have a lighter land position in markets where it's relatively easy to process land or to acquire land. So the extremes for us would be San Diego County, where it may take a decade to get property entitled, and one -- the benefit of that is that, that becomes very valuable property. And it's important to have access to land into markets like that in order to be an effective profitable builder. The other extreme would be Houston, Texas. Houston has no zoning. There's a vibrant land development community there, and historically, we're able to acquire many of our lots on a rolling option basis. And so we won't need a long land position in Houston, and then the other markets fall somewhere in between. In terms of our ability to flex, one of our challenges over the last couple of years has been to redeploy some of our land capital to markets where we may be a little bit land light. We made a conscious decision in Phoenix to sell land that we had impaired earlier in the recession because we were confident that we could obtain the land from others as the market recovered and that has been the case so far. If we had a very strong recovery in the Pacific Northwest, we might find ourselves a bit challenged to flex as much as some other markets. But we're comfortable with our land position as we look out the next 3 to 5 years in our markets, and we do have the ability to flex up in response to increased demand. But it varies by market.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. I guess the next question I had. Switching to wood, realizing that hopefully this year, operating leverage will be one of the factors that contributes to your ability to get to cash breakeven. What additional cost benefits do you have, if you will, incrementally already banked for 2012 versus 2011? Or have you realized more or less what cost benefits you had been working on in '10 and '11 within the segment? And what capacity, if we're surprised again to the upside, what capacity -- what in percentage terms could you restart, say within a couple of quarters, within lumber, within OSB to meet the market?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We've been engaged in a broad process for over a year to improve performance in this business. As I've discussed it, it includes revenue improvement as well as cost reduction. Some of the cost reduction would come from reduced operating cost and input costs, some would come from increased productivity. We captured some of those improvements in 2011. We have more to come in 2012. And so I can't give you a number as to what we would have \"in the bank\" for 2012. But we're making good progress and we should expect to see more improvement in 2012. As I look at our operating rates, we operated -- in the fourth quarter, our lumber system at about 75%. OSB was running at 72%, and our Engineered Wood Products were around 30%. So we have much more room to flex it up in our engineered business as the housing market recovers. But we've got plenty of capacity in lumber, in OSB, and we're looking forward to the opportunity to test the margins when we're fully utilizing all of our facilities.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "First of all, could you remind us the percentage of your wood that you sell into your facilities? And conversely, how much outside wood your mills are buying?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Is this -- this is a question, Steve, around Wood Products or...", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "No. Your Timberlands obviously sell to China and to third parties, and I want to get the sense of how much they're selling to Weyerhaeuser facilities. And then are Weyerhaeuser facilities 30% beholding on your own Timberlands and buying 70% from third parties or I want to get the ratios, please?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "In each of our businesses, we participate in the outside market, both Timberlands and in our Wood Products facilities as well as Cellulose Fibers. If we think about the Western Timberlands, and these are rough numbers, Steve, about 1/3 of our logs would go to the export market, 1/3 would go to domestic third parties, and about 1/3 would go to our own mills. In the South -- and those numbers will move up and down on a year-over-year basis. In the South, a much higher percentage of our logs historically have flowed to our own facilities. But as I noted in my remarks this morning, we are consciously increasing our sales to third parties from our Southern Timberlands. Last year, that number exceeded 20%. And that's been a good market for us. We're seeing good prices and we are building relationships with third-party customers that we'll be able to continue to serve in 2012.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Terrific. And the other quick question also focused on the Timberlands is we've seen few small deals recently at very good prices where the buyer approached the vendor. Are you open to hit the bid if good offers materialize or would you rather grow your asset base?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We are in the market all the time as a prospective buyer. And at the right time and the right place and the right circumstances, we could be a seller. But generally, we're -- and we have routine dispositions of nonstrategic land, that in some cases, are part of 1031 transactions or HBU land. In general, our strategic intent is to grow our Timberlands position. But we are engaged in the market and have exposure to both buyers and sellers...", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Sure. Do you have any 1031s that have to be crystallized in the near future?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We always have some in process and -- so I can't talk about specifics. We match up the buy-sell opportunities.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "2 quick questions. First, Patty, working capital was a very big negative swing in Q4, which took free cash a lot lower than I thought. Can you give us a sense of what seasonal pattern we should be expecting, and if there was anything funny in this quarter? And then a quick question for Dan. You talked about the ability to sell land. Would you consider buying a land short builder at this point? Or do you still want to keep your exposure to home building where it is?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Patty, you want to address the first question?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure. On the working capital, you had a couple of things in the fourth quarter. So typically, our working capital in Wood Products would come down a little bit. In terms of reduced receivables in the quarter, we did have some inventory build in the fourth quarter to take advantage of some markets that new markets, in terms of customers, that we are building in the Wood Products business. The other swing that you had in working capital was in our Cellulose Fibers business, where we had more volume that we sold into the fourth quarter. And so I believe our receivables went up, those would certainly, swaps with the volume that we said would be a little bit lower and a little bit lower prices as well in the first quarter compared to the fourth.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "And to your second question, Mark, our focus in the Homebuilding business is to grow organically. We like the markets that we're in. We've got strong regional local brands that you're familiar with. And our focus in growing that business will be to flex up with the operations that we have and improve our selling activity and our production in those operations. As you know, today's volume is about 1/3 of what it was at the peak. So we have a great operations and have the capacity to build more as the market begins to recover. If there is a land-light builder out there that need lots, they better be talking to us because we'd be happy to sell lots, assuming we can do so profitably. So it's part of our ongoing business, and it's important for us to have a balance between our land sales and our Homebuilding operations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a question on the plan for 2012 on the outlook, 665,000 starts. That split between single at 455,000 suggests 68% single-family, 32% multi, which is quite a big change from what we saw back in 2005 and '06, and would suggest that future OSB and lumber consumption would be down 10% from that time point. I guess it's more of a question on the future. Do you see this sort of new sort of mix ratios staying at this level going forward? And what is your information in terms of house size and log in OSB consumption?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "During the recession, we've seen some reduction in average square footage in single-family homes, Paul, maybe 10%. There has been a swing to multifamily during this timeframe. Multifamily market right now is really record low vacancy rates in many markets. And a lot of that I'd attribute to buyer uncertainty more than a shift long term in choice of multi versus single-family. So it's a little bit too early to tell. And as I talked about the numbers for 2011, single-family dropped, multifamily starts were actually up. We have the ability to sell all of our Wood Products into the multifamily market. Multifamily units generally have a lower square footage, on average, roughly 50% of the single-family. The amount of utilization of products varies. In multifamily units, our data would show that if you look at lumber, lumber utilization and the multifamily unit as compared to single-family maybe about 1/3 of what is single would be. OSB about the same ratio. When you move into Engineered Wood Products, our numbers indicate about 60% on average usage per unit, so our strength in Engineered Wood Products will help in the serving any multifamily needs. And I think it's going to take some time through this recovery to see how the ratios between singles and multis actually settle out. I think what we're seeing now is multis being stronger, a lot of fires on the sidelines. My personal view is that as people start to reenter the single-family market, you'll see vacancies rise and multifamily, and people will take advantage of record low-interest rates and low prices for single-family. And that'll be what disburse the recovery in single-family overall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 quick questions. First, you mentioned in your remarks that you had a higher Japan volume in the first quarter, do you think that's a sign of a larger trend with reconstruction starting to happen more in Japan now, or is that just something that's seasonal for Japan?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "It's not clear yet, Josh. Our volumes to Japan during 2011 were about equal to what they were in 2010. And that is in light of the disruption that we experienced, and the country experienced during the earthquake and tsunami, so we've seen a pickup in demand from our customers. And so as Patty talked about, the outlook for first quarter, that incorporates the increase in demand we're seeing. It appears that, that is primarily growth of our customers and perhaps their share rather than the rebuilding efforts following the earthquake. The areas that were most severely impacted, I think, are going to take some time to recover, because they have very significant infrastructure needs that need to be addressed. Can't add any more color than that.", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "One other sort of housekeeping item. Your deferred income taxes on the balance sheet seems to have dropped very sharply this quarter. Was there anything that was due to, or is that just a onetime funny tax fluctuations?", "Patricia Bedient", "It's really the booking of the additional liability for pensions. So pensions is the biggest reason for why deferred taxes moved around.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "A couple of quick clarifications. I apologize, you may have said this to Chip's question before. But the pension expense on a booked basis, what's it going to be this year versus last year?", "Patricia Bedient", "So we said that this is pension and other postretirement benefits both, so they both flow into the same footnote. They're about a little over $80 million in 2011. In 2012, we would anticipate that, that'll be around $115 million. But there will be an amortization of a special item that will offset that $115 million for changes in the retirement benefit plans. So what I said to Chip was that we'll call that out as a special item. It's clear, but that's the change year-over-year.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And is that going to primarily show up on a corporate line or at the segments? And maybe an even easier way to answer, corporate in 2011 was roughly $100 million, is that a decent number to use for 2012 or should we be adding the $35 million increase in pension expense?", "Patricia Bedient", "Well, we charge to the segments themselves sort of normal service cost. And on Page 4 of the analyst package, we actually give you that breakout of what gets allocated to the business segments versus what stays at corporate. I would expect that the amount that gets allocated to the segments next year will increase a little bit as service cost increases, but the bulk of it would stay in the corporate segment.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And so corporate expense overall, would you expect that to go up a little bit 2012 versus 2011?", "Patricia Bedient", "It'll be a little bit up for that item. The Corporate segment does move around from quarter-to-quarter. In addition to these expenses, the other things that account for swings quarter-to-quarter or what happens to share-based comp, as well as foreign currency exchange fluctuations so it can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But sort of as a rule of thumb, I would think about $15 million to $20 million a quarter.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And then lastly, on the performance on Fibers, I was a little bit surprised with the magnitude of the impact you were expecting from pricing, given that you ship roughly 450,000 tons. The same hand, I was surprised how resilient pricing for you had been in the fourth quarter. And I'm wondering, is that a function of the way your contracts are set up? Are they either quarterly? Do you have a fair bit of annual contracts? How does pricing typically flow through into that business?", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Mark, we didn't hear all of the start of your question, I apologize. Could you just rephrase it a little bit, so we can get a better feel for what you're asking?", "Patricia Bedient", "I think your question was about mix in the fourth quarter or was about pricing in the fourth quarter that was a little stronger than what you have expected?", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "And then also the magnitude. I think you said about a $45 million impact 1Q versus 4Q, which you should about...", "Patricia Bedient", "Yes. The $45 million is about -- is a combination of both pulp realizations and slightly lower volume quarter-over-quarter. And in the fourth quarter, you had a little bit higher mix of specialty volume that went to the quarter as well. So there's a little bit of mix in the fourth quarter, and then there's a little less volume in the first quarter compared to the fourth.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Very good. And so there's not much impact from the way your contracts are set up? Do you have much in a way of annual contracts in particular in the pulp business?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Longer than annually, for a longer period of time, and they have some adjustments that are built in. But for our long-term customers, we have mutual commitments to keep them supplied. And that's really one of the great strengths of our business is the great longer-term customers that we have that are growing around the globe, and that provides a lot of strength for us in this business.", "Operator", "At this time, we have reached the allotted time for our Q&A.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I'd like to take one minute and thank everybody on the line. We appreciate all of your comments and your questions. As usual, if you have further questions following today's call, I encourage you to follow-up with Kathy McAuley. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning, and thanks for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser Company.", "Patricia Bedient", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to the call over to Ms. Kathy McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Thank you, Marlee. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.", "Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "As summarized on Chart 1, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter 2012 net earnings of $117 million or $0.22 per diluted share. That was our net sale of $1.8 billion. There were no special items in this quarter.", "Turning to our business segments. My comments reviewing the third quarter of 2012 refer to changes from the second quarter of 2012. Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 3 and 4. Timberlands contributed $80 million to pretax earnings, $3 million more than in Q2. Revenues from Timberlands exchanges were $24 million in the quarter, an increase of $17 million. In the West, log prices declined approximately $5 per cubic meter. Domestic log prices decreased due to an abundant supply of farmer wood. Export log prices were up slightly due to mix.", "Dry conditions and fire danger in the West resulted in a 3% reduction in fee harvest volumes. Road costs in the West were seasonally higher. In the South, log prices increased 2%, third-party log volumes rose 6% and the fee harvest was slightly higher. Silviculture costs in the South were slightly lower as planting was deferred into dry weather conditions.", "Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $59 million to pretax earnings in Q3, $29 million more than in Q2. Price realizations increased across nearly all product lines, as product supply channels remained lean. OSB prices increased $54 per thousand square feet or 25%, and lumber prices rose $9 per thousand board feet or 3%. Sales volumes for engineered wood products increased 8%. Sales volumes for lumber declined slightly as southern lumber mills took downtime in response to slightly weaker market conditions around the 4th of July holiday. Lumber mills operated at over an 80% rate in the quarter. OSB mills took downtime for scheduled maintenance resulting in lower sales volumes. The operating rate for OSB was 85%.", "Cellulose Fibers, Charts 7 and 8. Sale of fibers contributed $78 million to pretax earnings, $42 million more than in Q2. During the third quarter, this segment had a strong performance. Pulp production increased 9% and maintenance costs were lower. In Q3, there was only one scheduled maintenance outage of 13 days. In Q2, there were 2 annual maintenance outages resulting in 27 days of mill downtime. Pulp sales volumes increased 2%. Pulp price realizations were flat.", "Real Estate, Charts 9 and 10. Real Estate contributed $17 million to pretax earnings and had no significant income from land and lot sales. Second quarter pretax earnings of $15 million included $12 million of land and lot sales. In Q3, single-family home closings increased 21% to 615 homes from 508 homes in Q2. Home closings were up 21% of the same quarter last year. Although the average home closing price was $372,000, this was nearly flat with 2 -- with second quarter. Margins went up in most geographies, with the largest increase in San Diego. Gross margins in Q3 were 24.3%, up from 19.5% in the previous quarter. The backlog at the end of the quarter was 1,055 homes.", "Real Estate controls approximately 27,000 lots in our primary markets. In addition, we control 67,000 lots, mostly under options in a large master plan community in Nevada, where development and construction is on hold pending improvement in the local market.", "Unallocated Items, Chart 11. The foreign exchange gain of $11 million in Q3 was due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. The swing from Q2 was $19 million. Offsetting this was a charge of $10 million for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. As we discussed last quarter, this item was formerly reported at the segment level and is now recorded in unallocated items. The charge for share-based compensation increased in Q3 as the price of Weyerhaeuser stock appreciated. The increase in share-based compensation largely accounts for the increase in SG&A.", "Now I will turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll start by saying that I'm pleased with our strong quarterly performance. As Kathy noted, we earned $117 million during the quarter. Comparing this quarter's earnings with our second quarter earnings before special items, we had a quarter-over-quarter increase of $70 million, with each of our core business segments showing gains. The rise in our earnings was a result of ongoing business improvement initiatives, coupled with increasing strength of U.S. housing, which allowed us to capitalize on the full value of the company.", "Before I offer some brief comments on the performance of each of our business segments, I'll provide a macroeconomic context for our quarter. First, the housing market. On last quarter's call, I noted that the long-awaited housing recovery looks and feels real. After another solid quarter, all indicators point to continued steady improvement. Recent September housing starts data shows a seasonally adjusted level of 745,000 for the year, confirming what we're seeing on the ground in the marketplace. In addition to increased construction activity, we now have the latest release of the widely reported Case Schiller numbers, which are a bit of a lagging indicator. These numbers show broad modest increases in pricing across most major markets. Price increases helped build consumer confidence, which then begins to move more potential homebuyers off the sidelines.", "While today's construction levels are still low by historic standards, all forecasts point to continued recovery in 2013 as we begin to return the long-term trend levels that are needed to house a growing number of U.S. households.", "Since World War II, housing has normally led the way out of our cyclical recessions, but as economist Rogoff and Reinhart suggest, this time is different. In this recovery, the broader economy began to improve earlier in the cycle and we enjoy the benefit of improving global markets over the past couple of years in our Cellulose Fibers business. This time, however, it's Housing that has been lagging. Ironically, it now seems that the broader economy has hit a soft patch, perhaps in response to trouble in Europe and slower growth in China. Housing is at last beginning to play its historic role in putting people back to work.", "There are plenty of reasons to feel cautious about the pace of the housing recovery, including election year uncertainty and the year end fiscal cliff. Additionally, high oil prices affect our cost directly in the form of diesel fuel, resins and glues and freight costs. And high gas prices affect consumers, especially homebuyers in California. Nevertheless, our quarterly results show that we're improving our performance in this uncertain environment.", "With respect to global economic conditions, over 1/3 of our revenues come from exports of products from our Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands and Wood Products segments. Slower growth in the Eurozone and China affects demand for our products in these markets. Demand is also affected by supply from global competitors, adjusting to changing levels of regional demand. I'll discuss specific factors as I review results for our business segments.", "Now I'll comment on the performance of each of our businesses in the third quarter. In Timberlands, we had a solid quarter, with earnings increasing slightly as a result of increased profits from dispositions. Export sales of logs from our strategically located Western lands are a competitive strength of Weyerhaeuser and they're an important component of our earnings. During the past quarter, demand from Japan, which is our largest export market, remained stable. Quarterly volume was down slightly due to the timing of ship departures. These shipments will be included in the fourth quarter results.", "Over the past few quarters, we've commented on the slowdown of log exports to China, but noted that we expected some pickup in Chinese demand towards the end of the year. Our effectiveness in building longer-term reliable relationships with direct customers, together with some correction of temporary oversupply, resulted in a 9% increase in our shipments to China during the quarter. This increase helped to offset the slight decline in volume to Japan, which will be reversed in the fourth quarter.", "In Wood Products, we again delivered strong year-over-year results and quarter-over-quarter results. Sales realizations increased for most products as a result of improved commodity prices, as well as a higher value product mix. The segment also benefited from the effective execution of performance improvement initiatives. The result, earnings nearly doubled compared with the second quarter despite slightly lower volumes for lumber and OSB.", "Excluding special items, our $92 million in EBITDA for the quarter was up $102 million from the third quarter of 2011 and year-to-date, we're up $195 million, demonstrating the operating leverage that we have with our large scale and all product lines, especially lumber and OSB. Improvement year-to-date is a result of better market conditions but also from deliberate, across-the-board initiatives that we've undertaken to improve our performance. In total, these initiatives have contributed to more than half of our year-over-year bottom line gain.", "Examples of these broad improvement initiatives include revenue gains from targeted price increases for both commodity as well as value added products, volume growth from an expanded presence in the repair and remodel market, reduced manufacturing costs from higher operating rates and greater manufacturing reliability and lower raw materials cost due to improved log recovery, reduced purchase of outside veneer and reduced use in cost of wax and resin additives. We still have further opportunity to improve our performance, but we're pleased with our progress.", "Moving to WRECO, as Kathy noted, earnings increased slightly from the second quarter results as home closings rose 21% due to steady market improvement, as well as seasonal activity. This quarter, we had no significant land sales compared to the second quarter when we sold our Cross Creek Ranch master plan community in Houston. Sales continued to show the strength of the housing recovery as quarterly sales increased 45% compared with last year. Year-to-date, total sales were 40% greater than last year and they're up in every one of our markets. This sales activity led to a 74% increase in our backlog compared with last year.", "The national housing market continues to improve in a measured pace, tracking job growth and a steady decline in both new and resale home inventory. Real Estate is still local [ph], however, and the pace of recovery differs among our regional markets. In the quarter, our most improved market was the Inland Empire of California, where sales doubled from the second quarter and tripled from one year ago as we tap the market opportunity with attractive, newly designed homes for more price-sensitive buyers. Sales in the Washington DC market,  which typically are slow in the summer months, showed surprising strength compared with last year. This improvement included sales of affordable homes, which are required as part of our development entitlements in this region.", "Year-to-date, our most improved markets are Arizona, Las Vegas, and California's Inland Empire, followed by solid gains in the Puget Sound region, Washington D.C. and San Diego. The L.A. Ventura market is beginning to show signs of slow recovery, and Houston, which has been a solid market during the downturn, has maintained steady volume this year.", "My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers segment. Our Cellulose Fibers segment earnings increased significantly as a result of less plant maintenance downtime and higher productivity. This improvement came despite challenging global market conditions. Price realizations were approximately flat, holding better than commodity grade index prices which declined during the quarter.", "With approximately 2/3 of our Cellulose Fibers sales coming from exports, foreign exchange rates can affect our results. During the quarter, the Canadian dollar rose slightly, while the euro strengthened late in the quarter in response to new Eurozone policy measures. Both changes should help the relative competitiveness of our Cellulose Fibers segment.", "We continue our dual focus of continuous improvement in our manufacturing and marketing, while also developing innovative new products. Innovation over time will provide margin uplift and allow us to continue to grow with global customers. Construction is nearing completion at our new modified fiber manufacturing plant in Gdansk, Poland. Product qualification is set to begin by year end, and we should begin to deliver product by midyear 2013.", "Our newest announced product is THRIVE, a proprietary form of thermaplastic composite, using a sustainably sourced cellulose fiber from our pulp mills as a reinforcement additive. The product will initially be used in automotive parts and household goods. This green polymer product will help manufacturers of auto parts improve performance characteristics and cost compared to their existing petroleum-based parts. This will not have a significant near-term financial effect for us. It's an example of our success in developing innovative new products from cellulose, in this case, for new customers, starting with 4 today with global potential in the future.", "Before turning to Patty for comments about our fourth quarter outlook as well as financial highlights, I will talk about our recent decision to increase our dividend by 13%, from $0.15 per quarter to $0.17. When we converted to a REIT in 2010, we stated that our objective was to set an attractive dividend that would be both sustainable and could grow over time. In setting our initial post-conversion dividend level, we wanted to strike the right balance, considering our overall economic outlook, our outlook for near-term company performance, our targeted capital structure and the affordability of our targeted dividend.", "On last quarter's call, in response to a question, I said that we would set our dividend not looking back but looking forward, considering our future earnings potential, as well as our view of market conditions. Although we remained cautious about the pace of recovery in the U.S. and global economies, our board was pleased to take action at this time to increase our dividend. This decision was based upon the clear results of operational improvements to enhance performance within each of our businesses that are evident in our report this morning and are confident that housing fundamentals are improving.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss our fourth quarter outlook, as well as provide financial highlights.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. Notwithstanding the uncertainty in the overall economy, we are pleased that nearly one month into the fourth quarter, we continued to see the sustained signs of an improving housing market.", "Our outlook for the fourth quarter is summarized on Chart 12, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the West, domestic log prices are anticipated to be slightly higher on volumes comparable to Q3. Export volumes to Japan, our highest margin log, remain strong and are expected to increase in the fourth quarter. Housing markets in Japan have been stronger this year, driven by a combination of historically low mortgage rates, planned increases in consumption taxes in later years and some rebuilding and repair activities from last year's tsunami. The weak euro continues to create heavy price competition from European laminated lumber. Demand and prices for our logs to China are expected to increase moderately, with improvement in both residential and commercial construction activity.", "In the South, realizations for logs are expected to be slightly lower due to a smaller piece [ph] size, with a heavier mix to chips and fiber. Fee volume is likely to be slightly higher seasonally. We will see significantly increased costs, mainly due to the timing of silviculture treatments. Nonstrategic land sales are expected to be flat to Q3. Overall, we expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the third quarter.", "In Wood Products, the fourth quarter is traditionally one of the weakest earnings quarters of the year due to seasonality. While we do not -- while we do expect to see some softening as we progress through the quarter, to date, prices and volumes have been unusually strong for this time of year across most product lines. We will likely have reduced volumes later in the quarter and we will continue to match supply with demand. We continue to focus on driving operational improvements across the system and we will take the opportunity with the slower holiday season to complete some minor maintenance in capital projects. We expect to be solidly profitable in the fourth quarter, but well below third quarter levels.", "Moving on to Cellulose Fibers. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales realizations for pulp to decline, primarily due to softening in the fluff market, which lagged the decline in NBSK. Global softwood inventories are in the normal range, but uncertainty in the global economy still exists. Sales volumes are expected to increase somewhat compared to the third quarter.", "Our final planned outage for the year was completed earlier this month, with downtime of about 6 days, compared with maintenance downtime in the third quarter of 13 days. As a result of fewer maintenance days, maintenance expense will be lower. Energy costs will likely be somewhat higher as a result of lower electricity sales and somewhat seasonally higher natural gas usage. We expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment for the fourth quarter will be comparable to the third quarter.", "In our Real Estate segment, we anticipate home closings to increase to just over 800 compared to 615 in Q3. The mix of closings in the fourth quarter will include fewer closings from certain high-margin communities in San Diego and increased volume of affordable homes with low margins due to regulated sales prices. As a result, although our homebuilding activity continues to be strong, we will likely see margins drop to below 20% in the fourth quarter. The increased closing volume will also result in higher selling-related expenses. We expect that earnings from our single-family homebuilding activity will be slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. And it is possible that the fourth quarter could have some land sales, although the amount and the timing is difficult to predict. There was no significant land sale activity in Q3.", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. Through the third quarter, capital spending for Weyerhaeuser Company totaled approximately $219 million. We still expect total spending for the year, which includes reforestation, to be around $290 million. We ended the quarter with cash of $608 million. Major uses of cash during the quarter included debt maturities of approximately $181 million and a $97 million payment on a note related to a timber monetization for timber that was sold in 2002. During the fourth quarter, we expect to receive about $110 million when the related financial investment matures.", "Cash received for stock option exercises during the quarter was approximately $66 million, driven by the higher stock price. Our dividend payout in the fourth quarter will increase to approximately $92 million, reflecting the increase in the quarterly per share dividend to $0.17, as Dan has already discussed. We have no further debt maturities this year and we expect working capital balances to decline seasonally by year end, however, not to the levels of last year end given our stronger wood products markets.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. Quarterly results from all of our business segments demonstrate the operating leverage that we have to a recovering housing sector, as well as operational improvements in each of our businesses that are increasing our competitiveness. We will continue to focus on what we can control, improving our operating performance and our relative competitiveness, being prepared to take full advantage of the quality of our assets, the strong relationships with our customers and suppliers and the commitment of our dedicated employees.", "And now we welcome your questions and comments.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I got a question on cost. You've done a good job of containing SG&A over the past year. But as we look forward to 2013, there's a possibility you could be growing revenue, maybe in the double digits. You should be seeing volume recovery in most of your businesses. Can you talk about how you think about SG&A targets in that environment? And then in terms of working capital requirements, as you ramp up volumes, what are the working capital needs and maybe the incremental capital spending that's going to be tied up as we move closer to a million starts next year or the following year?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Let me first talk about -- address your question on SG&A. We've made a tremendous amount of progress on bringing down our overhead expenses over the last 3- to 4-year period, and our journey is not done. We continue to look for opportunities to continue to ratchet down our G&A. However, we are now shifting to a period where we expect to be growing because of the pickup in housing and the need to be restaffing in certain locations. A lot of the restaffing is not reflected in G&A, it's cost of sales headcount. So we continue to be focused on managing our G&A and keeping the gains that we've made during this downturn. We would expect selling cost to be increasing, coincident with the pickup in sales because fundamentally, most of our selling costs are tied to revenues. And we would expect selling-related expenses to be increasing as we begin to recover. As we think about working capital, Patty commented that we shouldn't expect the same level of working capital at the end of this year in our Wood Products business as we had last year because we are selling more material and we are manufacturing product not just to maintain our current level of business, but as I mentioned in my remarks, we are increasing sales in certain channels. And so there will be some additional working capital related to increased sales activities as we go into 2013 and as we continue to expect housing starts to recover. We would expect the same thing to be showing up in our WRECO business throughout 2013 because we expect our volume to be increasing coincident with the pickup in housing.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Maybe the one thing that I would add, and you saw that in this quarter, as Kathy commented, where G&A will go up to the extent that it -- the stock price impacts, the variable compensation in terms of marking our share price to market. So I look forward to that part of the G&A going up, but as Dan said, we'll continue to stay very focused on holding on to the G&A gains and really increasing that through productivity and some of the activities that we have underway.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then maybe just shifting gears to Chinese log demand. You referenced expectations for improved log prices on Chinese homebuilding activity. I'm just wondering, can you tell us what you're seeing in October and is that something that you're really seeing now? Is there sort of an expectation for an improvement towards the year end? Or can you just give us any kind of color on what you're seeing now?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, we saw some pickup in our export activity in the third quarter, probably a little bit better than we might have imagined. We had been anticipating some market recovery towards the end of the year. We were able to capitalize on better conditions in the third quarter, and we would expect that to continue through the fourth quarter and into next year. Some of that, as I said, is related to working down inventory, generally in China, but also us continuing to capitalize on the relationships that we have developed with our Chinese customers. There was a slowdown in construction in China that now seems to be reversing itself a bit. Remember that we're not selling structural grade material into China for wood frame housing. The wood that's going to China is used in construction for, primarily, forms as well as other industrial uses. But I think we're seeing the benefits of the predictability of our logistics, the quality of our logs. And so we expect that we continue to take advantage of the opportunity in China, recognizing once again that our largest market is Japan, where our export volume for logs.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "But Anthony, to your question, what we're seeing for China now, we are having -- and they are moderate increases, small, but we are seeing the pricing picking up on our China. And as Dan talked about, we really go through very established customer relationships. So it may be a little different than what you're seeing in the broader industry.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So 2 things. I mean, everything you've said about housing is right and bullish and I think we all feel pretty good about it. Was the increase in the cancellation rate anything special or is there something we should be watching for there? And then a second question, I know I've sort of asked of this question before. As I talk to Southern landowners, they tell me that rotations are changing dramatically just by default. Is your system not seeing that just because it's so big?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "With respect to cancellation rates, I think they've been extraordinarily low for the last several quarters, and I think, Mark, what we're seeing is a return to perhaps a little bit more normal situation. The primary reason today for cancellations is the channel and [indiscernible] qualification, which is still a difficult process for most home buyers. And so there is some level of discouragement that leads some to drop out but I -- I don't view the uptick in cancellation rate to be troubling. In fact, there's a very low level of finished inventory in the market for new homes and the inventory levels of these sales have come down pretty dramatically. So there's a shortage of product out there and that causes me to feel relatively comfortable. Southern log rotations, we're not seeing any significant changes in our system.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Dan, again, I appreciate the increased data and kind of visibility inside Weyerhaeuser we continue to get from you guys. I did wonder today, can you give us any color on the non-strategic timber sale in the quarter, just in terms of location, acreage and values that you're seeing out there?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Mark, this is Patty. Actually, it's not just one, there's a number of ones that we have that are small in size. Most of the activity that took place this quarter, I believe, was primarily in the South.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And do you have an expectation, Patty, for what we will see over the next 12 to 24 months in terms of aggregate levels of nonstrategic sales?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, Mark, it's difficult to know. As you know, those sales are lumpy. I wouldn't see a significant pickup in the amount of acreage that we would bring to market from a sale perspective, only because we've really optimized the portfolio. So in terms of additional non-strategic assets, as you know, we sold a fair amount over the past. In terms of things that might come on the market, I think we are seeing some pickup from the industry broadly, but difficult to know exactly what will happen over the next 12 to 15 months.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And could you talk a minute  -- at WRECO, what you're doing vis-\u00e0-vis lots and lots of options at this point?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Yes, I mean, we always approach the WRECO markets differentially, Mark, as we've explained in the past. It's really a function of what the entitlement risks are in each market. We are always active in the market. We have a strong pipeline of lots at various stages. And so we're confident that we've got lot availability that we can see for an increase in activity in 2013. As we look out towards 2014, our plans are in place to be sure that we've got the improvements going in, so that we'll have finished lots for those timeframes. We also have lots, I think, as we discussed before, that where we have the ability to sell to other builders at the right time and the right place, and we've got the optionality in our portfolio to either build homes on those lots or to sell them to others, if that happens to be an advantageous strategy. The lot market is tightening up in most major metro areas, especially finished lots. So the industry is working through a lot of the lots that had been developed prior to the turndown in the cycle. Now, we're back into a mode of having to put in infrastructure improvements to complete new lots. And so that is causing some escalation in prices in most markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "The thing that stood out, and I know we're not back to normal times and who knows what normal will be. But when you go back in the past, it seems like you all had usually a rush of closings in the fourth quarter in Real Estate that really took the number up a lot. And again, knowing we're just on the turn, I can see why it might be premature. But is there anything else going on in that might make the pattern seasonally be different as we go through the next few years as housing, I assume, continues to recover as that happens? Or will we -- at some point -- or is this an unusual year that the fourth quarter is not really moving up a lot?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, our fourth quarter closing estimate is increasing, and that is typical with the seasonality that you observed in the past. I think that's typical, not just for us, but for other builders. And so we have actually a fairly significant increase in closings that are projected. As Patty pointed out, the margins will not be as great as what they were in the third quarter. And so that's a quarter-over-quarter comparison that's important to recognize. Q3 margins were higher than normal because of a mix that was heavier to San Diego, especially some projects in San Diego where we were closing out subdivisions and had very high margins. As we move to the fourth quarter, the shift of mix moves away from San Diego to more affordable markets where margins are lower and is further affected by the fact that we have a significant number of closings that we're projecting out of our Winchester operation in the Washington D.C. Metro area, where they will be delivering some affordable homes that are required as part of the entitlement process in Maryland and Virginia. And so those are very low margin homes that are part of an overall subdivision development. Those affordability requirements are imposed on developers in projects that are roughly 50 lots or more. And so what you're seeing really is a quarter-over-quarter comparison that is a mix shift and it accentuates those differences. But we still expect an increase in activity in the fourth quarter foreclosings. What is noteworthy this quarter, as we look at the fourth quarter, I think as Patty noted, normally, we'd have more slowdown in the Wood Products business. And what we're seeing is pricing hanging in there a little bit longer than what might be normal and I think that's related to construction activity, not for homes that will be delivered this fourth quarter, but early next year.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "So Chip, just to give you some numbers on the closings, if you went back last year in the third quarter, we were at 508, and we went to 582 in the fourth quarter. This quarter, the third quarter, we were at 615 and we'll be over 800 in the fourth quarter for this particular quarter.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. And that's very helpful with the mix. It sounds like it's unusual. I just want a quick follow-up. I'm looking at your guidance for Wood Products, and we always -- as we all know, have to take it with a grain of salt given the volatility although there are lags. It just seems to me that you are taking a quite cautious view, especially given that in the last week or 2 we've seen a rise in the price of both lumber and OSB at least in the trade press. And now we've got this hurricane, which of course you guys don't have to worry about out there, that is about to visit us here on the East Coast. And so I mean, are you taking a large dose of the normal seasonality in putting that into your guidance? And -- or do you actually think this is -- that no, which -- are you being conservative?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I think it's a fair statement, Chip, that our overall guidance is conservative. As you appropriately pointed out, volatility for pricing in both of those commodities has been a pleasant surprise, both in the third quarter. And as I said in my opening comments, to date, in the month of October, we've been pleasantly surprised with the strength of pricing. Just to give you maybe some way to gauge that a little bit, in lumber, every $10 of movement in price for us, in this quarter, it will be about $3 million per month, given the volumes that we're projecting for the fourth quarter. And in OSB, every $10 is $2 million a month. So those earnings move pretty dramatically with price increases. So if these price increases hold, we will be above the guidance that we gave you for the fourth quarter, and I think you know this. The nice thing about Wood Products is you do get some visibility as we go through the quarter in terms of what's happening out in the market, given the printed publications that come out. But we're pulling for higher pricing in both of those. And I would be very pleased later in the quarter to be reporting that our guidance for the fourth quarter was higher than what we're talking about today.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Two final comments on that question, Chip. When the new housing start numbers were announced last week, that did cause some increase in activity among our customers because our customers are running with very thin supply inventory levels, and they would normally be managing inventory levels down at year end. And so good news with starts causes the channel to react relatively quickly, especially with limited amount of product in the channel. And then finally, we do care about the hurricane. That will potentially affect our manufacturing business in our woods on the East Coast, as well as overall market conditions for our customers, and so we're concerned about that just as much as you are.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two questions. One on WRECO to beat that perhaps into the ground and one on Cellulose Fibers. The closing that you're projecting for fourth quarter are actually pretty normal relative to your backlog if you look over history. And certainly, you've talked about mix and the fact you have more affordable housing being produced this -- or closed this quarter. Yet, traditionally, then the fourth quarter from an EBITDA dollar standpoint and operating profit dollar standpoint, has been in fact larger than the prior quarters. Should we now assume that this change in mix is something that we should expect for future periods? Are there any implications from this or is this really just a one-off factor? And when you're talking about mix, could you relate at all what the selling price changes were on what closed this quarter within your regions? On Cellulose Fibers, my question is have there been any positive or negative implication thus far in terms of your demand from some of the outages that we've heard about on superabsorbents relative to that Japanese factory explosion?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "So George, I'll answer it in the order that you asked them. With respect to the fourth quarter, it is a mix issue, especially relative to Q3, and it includes these affordable units. And the issue on the affordable units is that there's a different rhythm to them. So in our Winchester operation, which is where these sales are coming from, they are normally a pre-seller of homes. So they take an order and then they build the house and deliver it. With these affordable units, they are attached, they're part of a larger project. We build them and then when they are close to completion, we turn really the sales process over to the community entity that handles these affordable units. And so it's a larger number of deliveries all at one time. And so when you have low margins in a large group of homes, it will tend to drag down the overall mix. That's not something that I would expect over time, but there is some lumpiness to the way those affordable units are delivered. We are also seeing an increase in closings that tracks the sales that we've had earlier in the year in some of our lower-priced markets, and so that is also affecting margin. As we look at cash flow, the increased activity in closings will generate more cash flow even if margins are down a bit because fundamentally, we're recovering all of our costs, including the land cost that's invested in those slots. With respect to the question on the SAP...", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Maybe before you go there, Dan, in terms of the EBITDA quarter-over-quarter, fourth quarter last year to this year, the other thing that impacts that, George, I think you referenced that the average closing price itself. And you can see that delineated somewhat on Chart 10 that's in the packet. You can see the average closing price at the end of last year's fourth quarter was almost $400,000, this year it's $372,000. Right below that graph, you can see the average sale price, which came down through the end of last year and the beginning of this year, but now it's trending back up again. So it's a combination of those 2.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Patty, that's mix. So I mean, would you say that all your markets are seeing increases in selling prices even if the mix itself has changed the average price that you're reporting?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "We are seeing some. It's not a huge significant amount. We certainly will look forward to seeing more as housing recovery is greater, but...", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We did see a pickup in the quarter in September. So if we look at our -- September numbers are different than the quarterly numbers, but the September numbers, prices were up, I think, in every single one of our markets.", "Question on the SAP outage in Japan, that did lead to some activity with some of our customers who are trying to replace the amount of production. I think that plant produces about 20% of that product worldwide. And so our key customers contacted us, and we've been taking some of their needs in order to fill the gap that they'll experience with that outage.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Well, with the housing momentum gaining the -- with the housing momentum improving, especially with the housing starts number that we saw a couple of weeks ago, which I think was a lot better than people's expectations, as you look at your Wood Products manufacturing footprint, is there any capacity that right now isn't running that you think you will be bringing back into 2013?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We're operating all of our lumber manufacturing facilities today. We're operating all of our OSB facilities. They have -- they are not running 100%. So they have some capacity potential. In our engineered wood products facility, we still have some mothballed facilities. The operating rate in our engineered manufacturing operations is lower than it is with OSB and lumber, and so we have the ability to ramp up production in order to meet demand in the near-term. And we have no announcements at this point nor we have made any decisions about when to bring back shutter capacity.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, understand that. And then as you're going to go through your budgeting process for next year, would you be able to share what housing starts number or a relevant range for housing starts number that you would expect PTUs [ph] as you think about budgeting within the Wood Products business next year?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We will share that on our next call at the beginning of the year. So we're tracking a number of outside forecast. The ranges today for 2013 from third-party forecasters that we track range from about $900,000 up to as high as $1.2 million. We'll have a better handle on that at year end and then we will share with you what we are using for planning purposes and that will help you calibrate perhaps what we're expecting to be delivering in our Wood Products business, our Timber business and homebuilding.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about Southern sawlog markets. So we've seen a reasonable pickup in housing activity, wood product prices are up, but it doesn't seem like there's much traction in terms of log prices. I'm just wondering, what do you think is holding that back and what it will take to start to see a pickup in turn there?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I think it will be consistent, steady demand. And we would expect some pickup in response to increased activity. It continues to be a regional market, Gail, as you know, and so it starts pickup generally. There's opportunities in the marketplace to manufacture more in certainly our Wood Products facilities as well as third parties. And I just think it's going to be continued uptick in demand that will tension the market then you should start to see some movement.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of homebuilding activity, when you look at kind of the sales activity that you're seeing, is the mix of business what you would expect to be normal, aside from the affordable housing issues that you're having in the fourth quarter? But I mean, are you seeing kind of the new homebuyers versus the mix you'd expect of new homebuyers versus move-up buyers, et cetera, that you would be expect in kind of a more normal housing market?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We are. I mean, we sell to a broad range of customers. The activity that I talked about this morning in the Inland Empire has been reassuring for us because that market has been very slow, and so we've seen a steady increase in activity, and I think we found a sweet spot in terms of price and product for that market. So that's a first-time buyer product. In some of our other markets, we've seen move-up activity being stronger. Las Vegas is a market where we've had some real success in move-up housing. So I would say it varies by market. We're not seeing any noticeable long-term shifts in demand in terms of the kinds of homes and the kinds of features. We're all focused on affordability, and we're focused on getting homebuyers confident again to go back into the marketplace. And so we're starting to see that activity and each of our local markets are responding with new product that meets the needs of today's buyer. Not seeing any significant long-term shifts at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Do you have a sense yet as to what your pension expense might be looking if rates, discount rates stay roughly where they are for next year versus this year?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Mark, we'll be going through those calculations here shortly. We really haven't finished that work up yet, so I really don't have anything to share at this point, but we will be going through that on our fourth quarter call.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. If I could add one more. Do you -- I know last year, you had a pretty big increase in the amortization of actuarial loss that went up by, I think, about $70 million. Does that stabilize this year or does that also go up again this year?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I have not gone through that computation, so I would just be speculating, sorry.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And then real quick, so the lumber panels, you mentioned you're operating at kind of 80%, 85%, if I caught you right.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Yes.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. The types of housing starts increased, particularly the upper end, that some of the forecasters are talking about, would potentially imply that, quite frankly, you would struggle to meet all the demand and maintain market share. Am I missing something there? And what can you do? Is there flex in your system now where you can meet that higher demand if need be fairly quickly?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We have flex in our lumber business because we have the ability to add hours and ultimately, if demand is sustained, to add some shifts. And then there is -- we have continued to make improvements in the productivity in the throughput in the mills that we do have. Our OSB mills have some flex capacity as we ramp up. And what we'll do is focus on serving the markets where we optimize our margin with longer-term relationships and we optimize our strategic advantages. So I would say we're looking forward to the opportunity to challenge ourselves, Mark, with that increased activity.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes, especially as we look at our lumber system, Mark, we do have the ability to do some debottlenecking across the system as the demand picks up. So we're looking at the ability to do that first with noncapital solutions and then obviously, to the extent that there are other capital things that would give us some additional capacity that we have in front of us, we'll be looking at doing that as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just wondering, I actually missed your discussion of how many lots you had. I think you said 27,000 within WRECO and you had a big position in Nevada, which I missed.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Yes, so what we said was that we have control of about 27,000 lots in our primary markets. Those are lots that are intended for our own homebuilding operations, as well as for sale to other builders. Of those lots, roughly 80% are owned and 13% are optioned. And then additionally, we control about 67,000 lots in a large master plan in Nevada. And that is a project that -- where we put the development and construction on hold, depending on improvement in local market conditions. The majority of those lots are held under a long-term option and the value of that particular property is based upon its development rights, and in particular its water rights. When you look at our lot position, we have always sold some portion to third-party builders. And what that gives us is a tremendous amount of optionality because we can choose to shift the mix between what we build and what we sell. So in general, about 25% of the lots that we control have been targeted for sale to the third parties, but we do had the ability to shift that mix depending upon opportunities in the marketplace. The length of our lot type line varies by market based upon local entitlement conditions. So we have a much longer position in a place like California where entitlements are very difficult, and a short position, in a market like Houston, which has no zoning and one can go through the process relatively quickly. And in some markets, we are developing the majority of our own lots and others. We continue to purchase lots from third-party land developers.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "So the 27,000, are those basically shovel-ready? And how would that compare to your target inventory in a normal housing environment?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "They are not all shovel-ready, but they are -- we control them and we have some level of entitlements. And what we do is we manage the development of these properties so that we're not investing in a lot of infrastructure earlier than we need to. So we're comfortable with the position that we've got. As the market picks up, we will continue to perhaps move the location of the lots around and the investment in lots, but that's an ongoing process based upon local demand and local opportunities.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Could you just remind me the time lag between when a home is sold and closed?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, that varies. So in some cases, we have finished homes. Houston is a market, for example, where we historically have built homes on a speculative basis because there is a large group of buyers in Houston that are relocating there, primarily in the energy business. And when they come to town, they need to buy a house. And so that house needs to be ready to move in, in probably a couple of months. If it's a completed home and if we sign a contract, in today's market, it's likely 60 days to go through that processing for a mortgage. And then the other extreme would be a pre-sale, which we do in most of our markets where we have a model complex, a buyer comes in, they sign a contract and then we build the house and the construction timeframe can run from, say 90 days to 6 months, depending upon the complexity of the house and the finish and ultimate price range and then you'd add the closing timeframe to that. So if it's a pre-sale, the homebuyer's going through the mortgage qualification process while the home is being built.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Again, sorry to beat the homebuilding issue to death, but just one quick question there. Can you tell us what your community count is on the WRECO side and how that's changed over this year and also on that, where you envision that going, I guess, in 2013?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "The community count for WRECO is down just a bit this year. And so what is happening in the homebuilding business at all times is you're continuing to open new communities, you're closing out new communities. Total community count today for us is 66 and we would expect that to be increasing next year. One of the things that we have focused on, especially over the last 2- to 3-year period is the sales per community. So we have focused on increasing the effectiveness and the productivity of every one of our communities to the point that today I think, based upon our data, we've got the highest number of closings per community of any public builder.", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And are you seeing credit trends among new homebuyers today or existing homebuyers, are using that going down the credit curve, so to speak, or is it still mostly in people with very high FICO scores, people that could get mortgages much easier? Are you starting to see some thawing of credit?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Still very high FICO scores. Mortgage qualification process is challenging. We're still waiting for a definition of qualified residential mortgage through the consumer product protection bureau and also coming out of Dodd-Frank. That's an issue that needs to be addressed in the industry. Right now, the initial proposals continue to be for a 20% down payment. I think that's too difficult. And there needs to be some moderation and the pendulum swung very far to tightening credit, and I think that longer term, we need to see some moderation in that process.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just 2 questions on Wood Products. You obviously saw OSB prices jump in the 2012 here and they seem to remain high. How do you see about the -- what do you think about the sustainability of that market? And then also on lumber, although it's come up, we're still below long-term averages. Just your future sort of view on that pricing dynamic as well?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I'll take lumber first, Paul. I mean, we take the long view on lumber and look at total projected North American starts, both U.S. and Canada. And we look at the relationship that we have with lumber that has historically come from Canada. We would expect demand to be increasing as the market recovers and we would expect a healthy environment for lumber. I can't project future prices. With respect to OSB, the market has been tight. Most operators are producing at relatively high levels. As I mentioned earlier, when the new starts number came out last week, it was evident that the supply channel was pretty thin. And so I think that's what's been helping OSB prices and we would expect that -- we've got a long way to go in this recovery. As I mentioned, today's levels are still very, very low compared to historic starts numbers and long-term trend numbers, and so we're bullish on the long term.", "Okay. Well, thank you for all of your questions. We appreciate you joining us this morning on the call. We especially appreciate your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser Company. If you have further questions following today's call, I encourage you to follow up directly with Kathy McAuley, and I thank you all for joining us this morning.", "Patricia M.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Q4 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "As summarized on Chart 1, Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter 2012 net earnings of $143 million or $0.26 per diluted share and net sales of $2 billion. For the full year of 2012, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $385 million or $0.71 per diluted share on net sales of $7.1 billion.", "Turning to our business segments. My comments reviewing the fourth quarter 2012 refer to changes from the third quarter of 2012. Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 2 and 3. Timberlands contributed $95 million to pretax earnings, $15 million more than in Q3. Earnings from nonstrategic land dispositions were $20 million, a decrease of $5 million. In the West, log price realizations increased 8% and volumes rose 5%, driven by strong export in domestic demand. Southern log price realizations increased 3% and volumes rose 9% as log demand began to tighten. Fee harvest volumes were 13% higher in the South and 5% higher in the West. These increases were due to seasonal factors and market demand.", "Wood Products, Charts 4 and 5. Wood Products contributed $38 million to pretax earnings in Q4, $21 million less than in third quarter. Commodity products benefited from tight inventory channels. Price realizations increased 2% for lumber and 8% for oriented strand board. Lumber volumes were 1% higher, and oriented strand board volumes rose 6%.", "Engineered wood product volumes were seasonally weak. Solid section volumes declined 12% and TJI's 14%. Increased log and raw material costs in maintenance downtime resulted in higher operating costs.", "Cellulose Fibers, Charts 6 and 7. Cellulose Fibers contributed $61 million to pretax earnings, $17 million less than in Q3. Pulp sales price realizations declined 2% and sales volumes rose 6%. Liquid packaging board price realizations declined 6%, and volumes were 7% lower due to operational issues at a production facility. Chemicals and energy costs increased in the quarter. These cost increases were partially offset by lower maintenance costs. During the fourth quarter, there was one scheduled maintenance outage of 6 days versus 13 days maintenance outage in third quarter.", "Real Estate, Charts 8 and 9. Real Estate contributed $81 million to pretax earnings, $64 million more than in Q3. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales were $65 million. Earnings from single-family home sales were $16 million. The average closing price increased to $381,000 from $372,000 in the previous quarter. Gross margins declined to 20.2% due to mix. The backlog of homes sold but not closed was 774 at the end of Q4, an increase of 80% from the number of homes in the backlog at the end of 2011.", "Unallocated items, Chart 10. The foreign exchange loss of $2 million in Q4 was due to a weakening of the Canadian dollar. This was a negative swing of $13 million. The elimination of interest segment profit in inventory and LIFO was income of $8 million, primarily resulting from lower lumber and oriented strand board inventory. This compares to an expense of $10 million in the third quarter.", "I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Over the past several years, we've laid the foundation by implementing initiatives that positioned the company to capture the benefits of an improving U.S. housing market. 2012 marked the clear beginning of that long-term recovery. This market improvement, together with our progress in implementing our own improvement initiatives, is evident in our fourth quarter and annual results.", "Revenues rose 13% during the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year. Our fourth quarter earnings increased 22% over the third quarter due to strong results from our Timberlands and our Real Estate segments. For the year, our net earnings before special items increased 78%, led by improvements within our Wood Products business.", "Our performance has improved steadily throughout the year, allowing us to continue to invest in our business, pay down debt and increase our dividend. As a result, our total shareholder return for the year was over 50%. I'm excited about the opportunity to build on the momentum of 2012 as we enter 2013.", "Before I discuss the performance of our business segments, I'll provide a brief comment on economic conditions that affect our company. First, the U.S. housing market. The housing market certainly turned a corner in 2012. Total starts, both single and multi-family, totaled 781,000, nearly a 30% increase from 2011. We began the year with stronger-than-normal spring selling season. This momentum continued through the fourth quarter, and we were pleased by the surprising strength of new home sales and Wood Products commodity prices. As we've noted in many fourth quarter reviews, both of these typically tail off at year end.", "On a seasonally adjusted basis, December housing starts jumped to a 954,000 annualized level. This is the highest level of housing starts we've seen since June 2008. Further evidence of a strengthening market is seen in home prices, which have increased year-over-year according to all major price indices.", "Another sign of improvement may seem counterintuitive is the declining level of existing home sales. At this point in the cycle, the cause is not lack of demand but record low levels of supply. Uncertainty in the home mortgage market has been a drag during this recovery. However, long-awaited new rules governing qualified mortgages add needed clarity to the process, and fence-sitting potential home buyers are finally moving back into the market. These changes are good for the housing industry and for the overall U.S. economy.", "To help you compare your own modeling and forecasting with ours, we're planning for just over 1 million total housing starts for 2013. Those starts are comprised of 675,000 single-family and 335,000 multi-family. This is roughly a 30% increase over 2012, that's a similar percentage increase as last year but off of a higher base.", "Market conditions are much improved from one year ago, but today's level of housing starts is still low by historic standards. We are at last on a clear path to recovery to long-term trend levels.", "I'll comment briefly on global economic conditions since approximately 1/3 of our revenues come from export of products from our Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands and Wood Products segments. Compared with conditions at the end of the third quarter, we're slightly more optimistic. In the Eurozone, the extreme prices conditions in 2012 seem to have abated and the euro has strengthened. The stronger euro should improve the relative competitiveness of our Cellulose Fibers business, as well as our Asian log exports.", "The Canadian dollar remains strong, which should maintain the relative competitiveness of U.S. manufactured wood products. This may be offset somewhat by reduced softwood lumber tariffs.", "In Japan, the new government seems ready to implement a stimulus package to jump-start their economy. This should increase export demand for all 3 of our forest products businesses. And in China, our export activity went through a period of adjustment in 2012. During 2012, the Chinese economy slowed but they also went through a political change. Export volumes for our logs, lumber and Cellulose Fibers products improved during the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year, albeit at lower levels than we had seen in the more frothy days of 2011. While these markets will likely remain somewhat volatile, we look forward to continued growth in Chinese demand.", "Now I'll comment on the performance of each of our businesses in the fourth quarter. In Timberlands, our earnings increased from the third quarter due to stronger domestic and export demand for our logs. Price realizations improved as a result of domestic price increases in the West and the South, with a shift in the mix in the West as a higher percentage of our logs were exported.", "Fourth quarter export shipments increased as a result of greater demand from all of our primary export markets: Japan, China and Korea. In addition, as I mentioned on last quarter's call, some shipments that have been scheduled for the third quarter slipped to the fourth.", "Harvest volumes increased from the third quarter despite some challenging weather conditions. Our operations were affected by high wind and rain conditions in the West during November and wet weather in the South at the end of the quarter. For the full year, harvest volumes increased 13% as we flexed in response to improving market demand. Minerals activity increased slightly during the quarter as continued softness in gas prices was offset by revenue from oil leases in the Tuscaloosa Basin. As we look forward to 2013, we expect continued strong markets for logs. Minerals activity should remain steady.", "In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter was a tale of 2 markets. We anticipated weaker demand for all of our products as we moved into the late fall and early winter months when we typically see a seasonal slowdown. Market surprise this year was the continued strong demand for our commodity products, lumber and OSB. This demand was caused by tight supply channels and the increasing strength of the housing recovery.", "Engineered products, which still suffer from low operating rates, did not benefit from the pricing strength of commodity products. Fourth quarter activity for these products and our related distribution activity was a negative drag on the positive results in lumber and OSB.", "As demand improved for lumber and OSB during the quarter, we also experienced higher manufacturing cost. We had higher cost for logs, veneer, OSB web stock, maintenance and energy. We also incurred increased labor costs as we began to staff up to meet an anticipated increase in operating postures in 2013.", "We continue to focus on effective execution and performance improvement initiatives across our entire Wood Products segment. The combined benefit of these initiatives and improved market conditions is apparent in our year-over-year results. Fourth quarter earnings improved nearly $100 million compared with last year, and the annual earnings increased over $300 million. Over half of this increase is attributable to our performance improvement initiatives.", "As we enter 2013, we are well positioned to respond to the increased demand from new housing starts, as well as the repair and remodel market. We've come a long way in this business, and we have more opportunity in front of us.", "Moving to WRECO. We finished the year with an exceptional quarter, and we're well positioned for improved market conditions in 2013. The notable event during the quarter was the sale of nonstrategic land in San Diego, which generated $65 million in earnings. This land, which is part of our Pacific Highlands Ranch master plan, is designated for very high density residential and mixed-use. As a large-scale land developer in California, our master plans include a wide range of land uses. Sale of these properties is consistent with our long-term strategy and intent.", "Let me turn to our single-family homebuilding business. Earnings from our single-family homebuilding business were comparable to the third quarter as single-family margins declined, primarily as a result of mix. The encouraging news from this year's fourth quarter was that our home sales increased nearly 40% from one year ago. This quarter marked a significant turnaround for our markets in Southern California and Las Vegas. Our Pardee president described the change as though someone turned on a switch.", "For the quarter, our California sales were up over 80% over last year and Las Vegas sales nearly tripled. This long-awaited California recovery is good news for WRECO and it's also a strong signal of future opportunity for our Western Wood Products and Timberland businesses. At year end, all WRECO indicators point to improving buyer sentiment.", "Our backlog is up 80% year-over-year. The average home price in backlog is 13% greater than one year ago. Our traffic count was up over 60% in December compared with last year, and our cancellation rate for the year was the lowest since 2004.", "With this improving momentum, we'll be opening a significant number of new communities during the year, which will enable us to meet our growing demand. New communities allow us to present a fresh new face to our customers to capture the emerging enthusiasm of buyers. Many of these new communities will be open during the first half of the year, capitalizing on this year's spring selling season.", "My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers business segment. Cellulose Fibers segment earnings declined from the third quarter. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased fluff pulp realizations and lower-than-anticipated earnings from our liquid packaging business. Worldwide pulp inventories declined during the second half of the year. Prices now seem to be stabilizing as we move into the new year. As I noted earlier, improvement in the Eurozone and government action in Japan may improve market conditions for us in 2013.", "In addition to our core Cellulose Fibers products of fluff pulp, NBSK and liquid packaging board, innovative specialty products continue to provide opportunity for us to differentiate our products and improve margins. Sales volumes of our pearl product to China continued to increase. In Poland, we have begun production trials of our Crosslink modified fiber product. We're on track to enter full production in the second half of the year. Longer term, we expect that our new THRIVE cellulose-based composite product will open new markets for us.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss our fourth quarter outlook -- first quarter outlook, I'm sorry, and provide financial highlights.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Well, we are looking forward to 2013, but as Dan said, I will focus my comments primarily on the first quarter of the year.", "So the outlook for the first quarter of this year is summarized on Chart 11, and I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. Export markets in the West are expected to continue to improve throughout the quarter. Log demand from our Japanese customers is strong as a result of the improving housing market in Japan and the supportive stance of the new government to implement policies to encourage growth.", "China log demand is expected to start somewhat slower due to the Chinese New Year holiday period in February but then continue an upward trend later in the quarter as residential and commercial construction picks up. As a result, export prices are anticipated to increase during the quarter. Stronger export demand, as well as an improved domestic lumber market have also contributed to rising prices in the domestic log market.", "In the South, realizations for logs are expected to be slightly lower due to a smaller diameter log size. Fee volume will be seasonally lower, primarily in the South, and may also be affected by recent wet weather logging restrictions. Before the effect of nonstrategic land sales, we expect that earnings in the Timberland segment for the first quarter will be comparable to the fourth quarter. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales will be lower, likely less than half of the $20 million earned in the fourth quarter. As a result, overall earnings in the Timberland segment will likely be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth.", "In Wood Products, market conditions for the first quarter are anticipated to be strong as the housing recovery continues on an upward path. We expect volumes to increase across all product lines. Sales realizations for lumber and OSB are expected to improve, and engineered Wood Products realizations will likely be flat due to mix. We have announced price increases for engineered Wood Products beginning in March, but most of the effect will be in the second quarter.", "Log costs are rising, especially in the West as the demand for export logs increases and the seasonal risk of weather-related restrictions is greater. Unit manufacturing costs should be lower as operating rates improve in response to increased demand and less holiday downtime.", "In engineered Wood Products, the benefit of higher operating rates will be mostly offset by higher input cost, especially for OSB, which is used for web stock. Given the strong market and our continued emphasis on operational improvements, we expect earnings in the Wood Products segment will increase significantly in the first quarter compared to the fourth.", "In Cellulose Fibers, sales realizations for both pulp and liquid packaging are expected to increase slightly from modest decline in pulp sales volume. The biggest variance in earnings compared to the fourth quarter will be in the area of maintenance. We expect to have approximately $20 million more maintenance expense in the first quarter as a result of an increase in the number of annual shutdown days, as well as a number of major maintenance projects. As we've discussed on prior calls, we are preparing for a transition to longer time between planned shutdowns, moving from a 12-month schedule to 18 months. We expect maintenance expense for the full year of 2013 to be similar to 2012 as we begin to implement this change, which should be fully in place by 2014.", "Progress on the startup of our Poland converting facility is on track as we continue the qualification process. We expect that overall earnings in the Cellulose Fibers segment will be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth.", "Home sales in our Real Estate segment have continued at a robust pace. Typically, we would not expect activity to pick up until after the Super Bowl. However, as Dan mentioned, we are seeing increased activity in most of our markets on a year-over-year comparison. Although it is early in the quarter, sales for the first 3 weeks of this year are up 125% compared to last year. These sales will become closings later in the year.", "At the end of 2012, our community count declined to 62 open communities as sales activity was brisk. At the end of the first quarter, we anticipate our community count will increase to approximately 80 communities. Our plan for community openings could change depending on market dynamics. We expect to close fewer homes in the first quarter compared to the fourth, as the first quarter is traditionally the weakest quarter for closings.", "In the fourth quarter, we closed 842 homes and expect that number to decline to just over 500 closings this quarter. However, it is a sizable increase over the 349 closings we had in the first quarter of 2012. Margins should be comparable to the fourth quarter at just over 20% and approximately 3% higher than the first quarter of 2012.", "Selling costs will decrease during the quarter as a result of fewer closings, and G&A costs should be lower as we will not see the year end catch-up for incentive comp that affected cost in the fourth quarter.", "We expect Real Estate segment results from our single-family homebuilding business in the first quarter to be slightly profitable and increase over the loss of $8 million in the first quarter of 2012.", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. We ended the year with cash of just under $900 million, strong cash flow from operations, as well as the receipt of cash associated with the maturity of a timber monetization note from 2002 were the major contributors. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter, including Timberlands' reforestation, approximated $66 million. The total for the full year of 2012 was $285 million, and in 2013, we expect to spend a similar amount.", "We ended the year with total debt of $4.3 billion. In 2013, we have debt maturities of just over $400 million, $156 million of which will be paid in the first quarter. Following our 2013 maturities, we will not have any significant debt payments until 2017. In addition, our $1 billion credit facility has no borrowings outstanding.", "I'll close with some comments regarding our benefit plans. At the end of 2012, the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by just over $400 million on a GAAP basis. This increase was driven by the lowering of discount rates. For example, in the U.S. qualified pension plan, our largest plan, the discount rate declined from 4.5% to 3.7%. The negative effect of this change in discount rate was to increase the plan's liability by over $540 million. Declines in discount rates have a significant effect on a plan's funded status. For example, if the discount rate was 5.4%, which was the rate in effect just 2 years ago, this plan would be in an overfunded status.", "Cash contributions for all of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2012 was $145 million. We expect a similar amount in 2013. The expense for these plans in 2012, excluding special items, was approximately $80 million. In 2013, we anticipate total expense of $98 million. $64 million is for normal service costs, which will be charged to the business segments, and $34 million is nonoperating expense, which will be included in unallocated items.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. Since 2008, we've had a steady drive to sharpen our focus on our core businesses and improve our competitiveness. We committed to improve profitability despite challenging market conditions and to maintain this discipline when the markets eventually recovered.", "I commented at the beginning of my remarks that we've laid the foundation that positions us to capture the full benefits of an improving U.S. housing market and an improving global economy. The evidence is now in that we're in the midst of a housing recovery. As the market improves, we'll have the opportunity to grow, increasing timber harvesting, Wood Products manufacturing and community development and homebuilding, and our Cellulose Fibers business will continue to grow with our global customers as we are doing in Poland.", "With this increased activity, we face challenges such as the availability and cost of skilled labor, inflationary pressure on manufacturing input costs and increasing land and materials costs. We're confident in the ability of our talented teams to meet the opportunities that an improving market brings, and we're absolutely committed to maintain the discipline that has brought us through this unprecedented period.", "And now we welcome your questions and your comments. Kathy?", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Yes. Brent, would you please open the floor to questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess starting off within WRECO, can you talk a little bit about what sort of mix changes might come with the increase in community count? Because it seemed like 2012 mix was a little bit weak. Would you expect to see that shift a little bit or remain kind of where it was in 2012?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, the mix is dynamic, in talking about the fourth quarter mix, Gail. We had, in the fourth quarter, an increased percentage of homes that are affordable dwellings. We had talked about that on our last call that these affordable units come with an overall master plan approval process. That was in the Washington D.C. market. And then we had a shift between third and fourth quarter away from a higher percentage of sales and closings in San Diego to other markets. So we would expect, as we look at the first quarter, as Patty commented, we expect the mix to be about the same. We have adjusted our product in every single market in response to evolving market conditions. We've had significant response in the Inland Empire Area of California in developing a new more affordable product. But in other markets, we've actually moved up market because that's where the demand has been in the last year to 18 months. As the overall market conditions improve, we will continue to find the opportunities where we have the greatest margin potential. With all of these new community openings, we have opportunities to adjust our product mix. And so what we will do throughout the year is try to give you some guidance on how we would expect that mix to be changing from quarter to quarter. But as we look from 2012 to 2013, we should not expect a significant mix shift, other than this resurgent demand from California can have a positive impact on us as we move throughout the year. It takes some time for those sales to convert to closings, but we have good visibility. As we look out, houses that are in our backlog, we know what those margins should be, and I think we'll just continue to update you on a quarterly basis.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just -- can I sneak one more in?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes, okay.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Log price developments, can you help us understand kind of the developments that you saw in the fourth quarter, and currently how much might have been due to weather and how much you think is due to true underlying kind of slight demand tightness because it does seem like, in both the West and the South, there were weather impacts?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "There was a little bit more weather impact in the fourth quarter in the West than there was in the South. In the first quarter, likely that we'll have more weather conditions that would impact us because of wet weather. What we are seeing in the log market is the impact of some recovery in U.S. housing, both in the West and in the South, and in the West, a continued increase in demand for exports. So we expect some upward pressure on log prices. We have weather events every quarter that may impact us a bit, but I think generally, we would expect that the impact is coming from the demand side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two general areas of questions, one in Wood and one in Real Estate, piggybacking on Gail. I guess in Wood Products, Dan, inflation offset a lot of the pickup in revenue that you saw in the segment. I guess that's to be expected this time in the cycle. If we look out the next year or so, would you anticipate that your realization should be at least able to keep up with inflation? And then taking a different take on it, if we hold raw materials and pricing constant, what kind of incremental margin do you expect you should be able to see out of Wood Products over the next 1 to 2 years?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "What we would expect is that as the market recovers, we certainly have different products, so we have our lumber business, we have our OSB business, we have engineered Wood Products. As the market demand picks up, there is pressure on log prices. And so the relative margin between logs and lumber shifts over time or logs and oriented strand board, but more related to logs. The impact in our engineered business comes through, as you noted, OSB input costs. But I can't answer your question specifically because it's a function of what supply is available on the market for logs and what production capacity comes back online in the Wood Products business. So it is the dynamic of supply and demand, and it's a function of production capability across the system. So quite frankly, I can't give you a specific number as I look out a couple of years. So what we believe is with a recovering market in the U.S., we should see increased demand for Wood Products, which will then translate to demand and ultimately pricing on logs, plus in our case, we have a significant export market off the West Coast, and that plays into the pricing dynamic also.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "George, the other thing that you saw in those margins in Wood Products in the fourth quarter was we had some downtime for the holidays and downtime for maintenance and implementing some capital projects. So as we see utilization rates improve, that will significantly impact that margin going forward as well.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, I'll leave that general area to the side for now. If we switch to WRECO, it was nice to see the increase in pricing and the backlog. Can you speak to what's been driving that? Is that what you're seeing in California or Las Vegas? And I guess again, just back to Gail's question, you had called out the mix issue in the fourth quarter, and you are more or less where we had expected you. But also, it seemed like Las Vegas, Nevada were stronger than we would've expected in the fourth quarter regionally broadly, not just Weyerhaeuser-specific. I'm curious why you didn't see more of a mix effect in the quarter.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "You're talking about sales prices which don't translate into the quarterly closing numbers, and so there's a lag, George, when we write those sales and when they are delivered. We were encouraged and have been encouraged not just by the fourth quarter, but as Patty noted, sales early this year had been very strong, which is atypical. We joke a bit about the Super Bowl being a turning point in the early year selling season, so this year is a bit of an anomaly. We're seeing prices moving up in every single market for similar type products, so that is not even addressing the mix issue as to whether or not it's a first-time product or a move-up product or there may be some additional pricing power. So we think that what's happening is certainly the existing inventory has diminished significantly. Homebuyers are going back into model complexes and making the commitment to buy new homes in part because they have more confidence in the economy, in their jobs, and they can obviously see that the market has bottomed and there is more likelihood of upward pricing movement, as well as perhaps some uncertainty about where mortgage rates are.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So the backlog price increase was broad not region-specific. Is that what you're saying?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "The first question is just to make sure I get this right. On the pension funding status, I believe last year it was about $1.1 billion under. And so you're saying, based on the discount rate changes, should be about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes. As you look at the total underfunded status for the pension plan, as you said, and this would be for the U.S. plan, as well as our nonqualified plan, we were, I think, about $1.150 billion. And at the end of this year, that will increase by about a little over $400 million. That's still for the pension, Chip. That doesn't include the other postretirement benefit plans. But if you're talking just pension, those were the right numbers.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Well, actually on that, I noticed that dropped from about $0.5 billion to $400 million from '10 to '11. Did that change the other things that much in 2012 or they stayed flat?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "When you say the other things...", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "The other postretirement benefits?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes, they were fairly flat. The biggest change was in the pension plan.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay, that's great. And then one quick one in addition. When you go back in past cycles, you can see, and I know the footprint's different, but you often see a pretty substantial seasonal, or often have increase in the operating income in the Wood Products segment. And as you know, prices today are way above their fourth quarter averages, and notwithstanding the, I guess, last night's report that there might have been a little bit of a backoff in lumber. I mean, could we see a triple-digit operating income number in the Wood Products segment, is that what you mean by significant?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, when I say significant, Chip, remember we're talking about the first quarter when you talk about a triple digit, but that's what we're working toward. So it will be a multiple of the fourth quarter and pretty close to that triple digit.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Dan, just one question. 2 years ago at Investor Day, you talked about the opportunity from being long land in your homebuilding business and the opportunity to sell land to homebuilders that were short. Has that process met your expectations? And is it reasonable for us to assume that we would see a significant ramp in that kind of activity in 2013?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Our strategy is not changed, Mark, and we have -- we are not long land everywhere but we are long in certain markets, especially where entitlement processes reward a longer land position. Where we have master plans, we have the ability to not only build those lots but sell to others. We took advantage of that more in 2011 than we did in 2012. In '11, there was a resurgence of activity. Builders found themselves to be lot short, and we took advantage of that in certain regional markets. We looked for opportunities in those master plans where we have the excess land to sell to others on a profitable basis. We did some of that earlier this year, or in 2012, when we sold the Cross Creek Ranch property in Houston. And so we have that opportunity in front of us, and we'll look for opportunities where we have pricing and margin potential to take advantage of that as compared to building out those lots ourselves.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carly Mattson with Goldman Sachs.", "Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you talk about how the company thinks about refinancing the 2013 maturities, and whether we should look for potential new issuance in the public bond market, or whether Weyerhaeuser would prefer to pay a downward cash?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure, Carly. It's still early in the year but what we have said in the past is that we think that $4 billion of debt is about the right amount of debt for the size of the company today. We've been working that down. So when we pay off our 2013 maturities, we'll be right at -- maybe just a little below that target. So I think the point will be what other uses we may have for any additional debt in the future. But where we are right now, we have said in the past, and that would still be our view, that around $4 billion in debt is the right amount for the size that we are today.", "Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then as a follow-up question, have you had discussions with the rating agencies about, particularly Moody's, about your -- the high BB rating that Weyerhaeuser has? And how does Weyerhaeuser think about the difference between being a crossover credit or a full investment grade credit. Has that view changed at all?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, Carly, we have ongoing conversations with both rating agencies, as you might well imagine. And we have historically been an investment grade rated company from both rating agencies. And Moody's moved us down years 2 ago when the markets in Wood Products especially were much more challenged than they are today. So we'll look forward to moving back into that investment grade area at Moody's, given the increase in the profitability and cash generation of the company. But I'll have to wait for them to make that move.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "In the Wood Products business, can you just provide more color around what the impact was from the maintenance downtime during the fourth quarter? And then as we look to 2013, is there any color you can provide on how we should be thinking about the change in the maintenance expense as we work our way through the year? I think in the pulp business in the past, you've been kind enough to provide that type of color to the extent that you can in the Wood Products business, that will be very helpful.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure, Alex. As we think about the seasonality in the business in the fourth quarter, we typically plan to be down implementing, that's when we target to do our capital project implementation and we plan maintenance. So it was more a quarterly statement as opposed to an ongoing piece as you think about the first quarter and second and third quarters, so I don't think there's anything big about that, that's different. It's just that the market was very much stronger in lumber and OSB, especially. And we probably didn't take as much downtime -- we didn't take as much downtime as we typically would in a normal year. Most of that would have come as well in engineered wood, where the operating rates have not been as strong. And then did you have a question about Cellulose Fibers?", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "No. I just -- the question really was if you guys can just put out a number for what the maintenance expense was in the Wood Products business for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, how that changed?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes, yes. I don't have a number for you in the actual maintenance for the fourth quarter for Wood Products. Let me see if we can pull something together and maybe you can check back with Kathy.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the follow-up question, as you know, Wood Products, what is the current profitability level in that business look like? Is it EBITDA breakeven at this point? And as you guys look at that business over the next couple of years, what U.S. housing starts level would that business really begin to generate meaningful profitability for the company?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, that -- the Wood Products segment is generating cash, Alex.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Well, I'm speaking about engineered wood products, not the entire segment. Just the engineered wood products subsegment.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Engineered wood products, in terms of the operating rate for the fourth quarter were still about 40% to 45% in that business. So really what we need to do is to get that operating rate up. And as we look forward in that business, it is a late cycle recovering business in Wood Products. In other words, of the 3 technologies that we have, engineered wood products, because it is more exposed to single-family -- housing or new housing rather as opposed to repair and remodel, it recovers a little bit later in the cycle. I can't tell you that, as you might know, the Builders' Show is going on this week, and the talk at the Builders' Show is concern about being able to get capacity or to get product as the cycle continues to recover. So we look very much forward to getting to that point. And I think as we move forward to increase housing starts, as Dan mentioned in his outlook, that we will see much improved results in that business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just following up on the sale of lots, given San Diego has historically been one of your stronger regions from a margin perspective, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the decision to sell that land rather than develop it yourself? And to the extent you can, can you talk about where the sale sort of leaves your land position in San Diego?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Sure. Anthony, the property that we sold is part of a master plan, North County, San Diego called Pacific Highlands Ranch, where we have a significant number of entitled single-family lots that we would build out over time. That's a market that as you commented on, has been very good to us in the past. We have high margins in our single-family business in San Diego. The particular land that we sold is zoned for high-density residential. It was a very high density so multistory product and mixed-use. So it is not our core product that we build. That is the kind of property that we would typically sell to other builders and developers who specialize in it. Some of that will be rental, some of that perhaps could be for sale but likely more rental housing. And so it's consistent with our strategy to sell the property that is zoned for other than single-family to others, and that was the decision. So as we think about our land position in San Diego and our lot count, doesn't affect, really, our lot count at all because it's not a product that we would build. So it's totally consistent with the way we manage that business. The good news is that the multifamily market has been very strong, and so it was an opportune time to sell it. The purchasers of that property, will still have to go through some of their own entitlement process over a 1- to 2-year period before they break ground.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then just maybe one last one, switching to Timberlands. I'm wondering how much your log exports to China were up or up or down year-over-year in 2012? And as you look forward to 2013, from a volume perspective, do you expect kind of a meaningful change in log exports to China?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "For the year, our export volume to China was up, but we expect it to increase as we go forward into 2013. The mix that we've talked about in the past is not significantly changed, so about 70% of our exports go to Japan, roughly 20% China and the balance to Korea. And as we look forward to full year 2013, I can't give you specific numbers on what the China volume is because it's not that predictable. But we see covering demand and we expect to be in a position to be delivering logs there as well as into our traditional markets of Japan and Korea. We have seen a pickup in activity in Japan. That's generally a more profitable market for us. They buy higher-quality logs, we have much longer-term relationships. But the relationships that we've built to China are encouraging for us and so we see it as an opportunity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Dan, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about sort of your positioning in the Wood Products business. It seems like over the last few months, we've started not only see a pickup in housing and building products activity, but we've started to see more M&A with the GP deal and then this Interfor deal that was announced the other day. I just wanted to get a sense of how you feel about your footprint in the business?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, we've seen that activity, Mark, and I would say it's not surprising. As the market starts to pick up, you'd expect to see some more of that activity. We like the position that we have, so we have good balance in our lumber business between the West and the South. As the market picks up, especially in California, we're excited about the opportunity to see improvement in our Western lumber system. OSB business, we've got 6 mills that are operating. We've increased production in that business over the last year, and we're moving, even as we speak into 2013, to increasing operating posture. I think in the fourth quarter, we are operating at about an 85% level. In OSB, we expect that to increase. So we're well positioned to serve both the Southern and the Western markets. Engineered wood products, Patty talked about it, is a late cycle business. We've got the leading brand in that business with our Trus Joist brand. And if single-family housing picks up, the opportunity there is that we do have a lot of operating leverage because we are operating it well less than capacity today, but we're positioned in the West and in the East to serve the broad needs of a recovering single-family, as well as the multifamily sector. As we look forward, there's still some question about the relative mix between singles and multis, as we move forward wondering whether there's change in patterns and increasing density. But we like the position that we have in every one of those products.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Would you want to expand in any of these businesses?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We look at opportunities. And fundamentally, as we look at opportunities, it's a function of how it would fit with our existing system and in relative financial opportunities. So I think we're active all the time in looking, but we have no immediate plans that we're prepared to discuss.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "[indiscernible] is there to say that our focus, really, is on improving the operations that we have, and we aren't operating the operations that we have today at full capacity. So we have room to continue to grow the business with the existing facilities that we have. So that's really the focus.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's fine. Just can you just mention where you're at in terms of kind of maximizing with kind of oil and gas and mineral revenue from the land? And you do have a lot of land down in Louisiana, and I just, I wonder where you're at in terms of extracting all of the subsurface value that you might from your holdings?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Our average earnings over the last year or so have been about $10 million a quarter, revenues coming from our minerals operation. There's been a bit of a shift in mix, Mark, between oil and gas. If we were to go back 3 to 4 years ago, when the gas shale activity took off, I think our minerals business at that point was generating about $60 million. Some of that was coming from these upfront lease payments as well as royalty payments. So on a steady-state basis, for the next 12 months or so, I think $10 million a quarter is probably a predictable number. Production levels are down in that business because of prices today for natural gas. Drilling costs for shale oil had been relatively high. We have land that's well positioned both in the Haynesville Shale gas area and the Tuscaloosa oil shale region. So we have active drilling going on in our properties, and I think it's really a function of pricing of the end product for oil and gas that will dictate how much additional activity there'll be in the next 12 months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "You guys have talked a little bit about the increased staffing, and I'm going to assume most of that has to do with the community count and with lumber production. But would you be able to speak a little bit more specifically on the lumber production side, how much you think you can get both lumber and OSB production up or just overall Wood Products production up throughout the year?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well when we talk about it, and I mentioned briefly with respect to OSB, we're increasing our operating posture and we have been doing some hiring, bringing people back to work in order to add shifts. As the market expands for lumber, we have the same ability to add hours and in some cases to add shifts. But we respond both to demand, but primarily pricing. And over the past 12 months, most of the hiring that we have done in the company has been production employees that we've been putting back to work in order to be able to ramp up and respond to the increased opportunities for Wood Products. In WRECO, our general staffing level has been relatively stable as we add communities, then we would certainly add production superintendents and sales teams. But in the WRECO business in particular, most of the activity is subcontractor-based, and so it doesn't have a significant impact on our headcount. Did that answer your question or did you have a different focus to your question?", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "No, no, I think that's helpful. When we look at the Timberlands business, you guys had mentioned also and it seems like the Southern log harvest went up pretty nicely in the fourth quarter. How much below, I guess, sustainable harvest or how much above your sustainable harvest could you harvest in the coming years if there was a very strong recovery? And what could those levels go to from where they are today?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "During the recession, we went through a period of a couple of years where we took our harvest levels down, and we have been bringing them back over the last 2 to 3 years. So you've seen a fairly significant ramp-up in harvest activity, 2011, 2012. We are managing our Timberlands on a sustainable basis. Over the next 12 to 24 months, you should not expect to see a significant increase in harvest activity because we are operating today at a sustainable level. In any given market situation, we have the ability to flex a bit, say plus or minus 10%. It's a little bit -- takes a little bit longer to increase in the West because of road requirements and permit requirements. But we have shared projections in the past in our main conference of long-term harvest levels in terms of how that would ramp up over time. That's more of a function of the maturity of the timber rather than responding to specific market conditions. So we have some limited ability to flex short term, as we've done in the last year or so. So we'll respond to market conditions.", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. Patty, you touched on the pension obligation and how that went up on a GAAP basis. Could you give us -- I know that may not be finalized yet, but could you give us an idea on where that went on a PBO basis at year end?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I don't know that I have that in front of me. Let me just see if I can help you with anything on that. I think we may have to wait for the K filing, which will come out later here in the next couple of weeks. Let me see if I can find the number for you, Josh, as we're sitting here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "So your log sales prices were up pretty good, particularly in the West Coast, which wasn't the case for all landowners out here. So I'm just wondering is that due to your exposure to Japan and China? Or is there also some benefit to putting higher logs through your mills at higher prices because you're basically transferring the revenue from a taxable jurisdiction into an untaxable jurisdiction?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "The latter is not the case. We sell logs to our lumber business or conversion businesses at market. The difference in pricing is more likely a function of our Japanese trade, Steve. And the quality of the logs and the long-term relationships that we have with customers there, where we are being rewarded for the quality of the logs and the consistency of delivery over a long period of time. And I think we have that same opportunity emerging in China because of the quality of our fiber, the predictability and sustainability on the logistical side. I think we're fairly compensated for the value that we deliver.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Perfect. One other quick one. Across the WRECO footprint, do you feel that you have a need to reload your land position anywhere across that in any of your geographies?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We are always purchasing new land in our WRECO system to replace the lots that we are selling with the houses that we deliver. So that is just an ongoing function of managing a pipeline of future lots. We are very strategic in where we have a land position. The length of that position varies by market depending upon the challenge of entitlements and how we are able to control it. So our focus is on efficient management of our cash, and allocation of resource was in that business to, number one, be sure that we have a pipeline, but also ensure that we are earning maximum possible returns on the use of our capital. So it is a region-by-region decision. But in fact, we are always in the market looking for lot positions for future deliveries.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "You talked about housing starts potentially being up 30% this year, and I want to understand what type of flexibility you have in your lumber business in particular, given that potential? If one were to assume that might mean lumber demand and if you have a differing view on this, please share. But let's say lumber demand might be up about 15% or so, would you expect to have the capability in your system to increase your production by at least 15%? And you talked about having already started that process. Where are you in that process? How much increased production have you already started to achieve?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We've had a steady increase in production as the market has begun to recover. In our lumber business in the fourth quarter, we were operating in about an 80%, in maybe mid-80s production rate so we have room to move beyond that in response to increased market demand. Also in the lumber business, Mark, our typical shift posture is 2 shifts. And so we have the ability to add hours to those shifts on a selective basis, and we have the ability, in some cases, to add an entire shift. We've got one facility in Cottage Grove, Oregon, that operates 24/7. That's not typical in the lumber business. But we do have a fair amount of flexibility in lumber to respond. And the response obviously comes from not just volume but we have to look at who our customers are and what pricing is. And so at the level of starts that we are at today, we've got a fair amount of room. As I pointed out, the level of starts in 2012 is very low by historic standards. We've got a lot of room to move between now and getting back to trend levels, which are sort of 1.5 million to 1.7 million.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Right. I guess what I'm trying to understand is that given your view of the world, presumably you're positioning yourself to be able to produce a good deal more product this year. And what I'm trying to understand, whether or not those actions have already been taken and we are already seeing that production, or whether you are in the process of taking those actions and the increased production will show up in 1 month, 2 months, 3 months?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "The increased production should show up as demand increases. So we're not producing excess inventory, and we're not producing inventory at prices that don't give us the margins that we think are appropriate. So we have the ability to respond as the market picks up. There's some delayed response. It's a little bit longer-term response when you -- when we're ramping up, let's say, adding an entire shift to an OSB mill. That takes a little bit longer time. And so we've gone through some of that activity over the last year in our Wood Products business but more likely related to our OSB facilities.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "So basically, you feel that you can be very quickly responsive and so you do not necessarily need to be building log decks, getting more work out. You don't have to like plan a month or 2 ahead of time, just so as I can understand?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "No, we're always planning ahead of time. So we have, actually, fairly robust staffing plans where we look out a potential demand and we're filling those positions. But I can't give you specifics on a by-mill basis. We are -- the headcount that we've increased over the last year, as I mentioned, has primarily been related to Wood Products production.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Mark, when you think about lumber, we don't have huge log decks. We don't carry huge log decks in our supply chain. So the things that -- and that's just a function of the way that we operate on an efficient basis. So the things that would provide hiccups in that to being able to meet that demand are more things like if we were to have a weather-related event in the West. That would drive out-of-log downtime. So it's not if you go back a few years and you think -- and some competitors still do today, carry a lot of inventory in the yard, we have really worked on our supply chain between our Timberlands business and our lumber business so that we can respond as market conditions do increase.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just an easy question, just on log pricing. It looks like prices are up in the Pacific Northwest, and I can understand the sort of the rally in Japan in advance of tax hikes in '14 and higher Chinese demand. I'm really concerned with the log prices in the South. And if I look at it historically, I mean, it seems to be a correlation of after 6 months of the lumber price hike, you were 6 to 12 months, you've seen log prices come up and we've seen that gap expand out, and lumber prices are up sort of 30% to 40% year-over-year. So the question is, when do you expect the log prices to start to move up significantly or materially in the U.S. South?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Paul, we are starting to see log prices move up in the South, I would say more on a modest basis. Our own sales realizations for logs in the Timberlands segment, as I spoke to, will actually be down just slightly. But that's really more a function of the diameter size of the logs that we're logging this quarter, and that's not atypical for us. We are looking at settings that we can access, especially as it relates to this wet weather. So that's just an isolated instance -- incident. But we would expect saw log prices to start to move more significantly in the South as we go through the year, assuming, that would be our assumption, that housing continues to recover.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Thank you. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today. We continue to appreciate your interest. As you can tell from our comments, we're encouraged by the recovery in housing that's underway. We think we're well positioned to take advantage of it, and we look forward to -- we're looking forward to 2013 because I think we have the opportunity to fully participate in this recovery. And we look forward to your continued interest. If you have questions following the call, follow up as you normally do with Kathy. Appreciate it very much. Good day, everybody.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "And, Josh, you can get that answer to your question from Kathy, we'll dig that out for you.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Okay, thank you. Have a nice day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Q1 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. McAuley, you may begin.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Thank you, Brent. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. On the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. A GAAP reconciliation can be found on Chart 19.", "Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we review the first quarter earning material, Patty Bedient would like to make a few comments. Patty?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everybody. As we begin our financial reporting for 2013, I want to call your attention to some additional information that has been included in our earnings release presentation material. This information is intended to provide you with some further insight into our reported results. I'll briefly describe some of the changes we've made to our earnings release slide package, and then Kathy will follow with her normal comments on the first quarter performance.", "We now present condensed income statements for both Weyerhaeuser Company and each of our business segments to assist you in comparing our quarter-over-quarter results. For Timberlands, we've provided additional detail on revenues from export log sales and the countries to which we sell those logs. This information is to help you understand the scale and diversity of our markets for our Western Timberlands. We've also included a quarterly detail of our nonstrategic timberland disposition.", "To better explain the earnings of our Wood Products segment, we are reporting the quarterly EBITDA for each of our major business lines: Lumber, oriented strand board, engineered Wood Products and distribution.", "In Cellulose Fibers, we've provided the total quarterly maintenance expense dollars in addition to our scheduled annual maintenance outage days. For Real Estate, we've included quarterly earnings from land and lot sales, as well as information on the number of lots we controlled at quarter end in each of our major geographies, similar to the information we report annually in our 10-K.", "We hope these changes will help you in your understanding of Weyerhaeuser, and we look forward to your comments and suggestions. And thank you for those -- that have been provided in the past.", "So now I'll turn the call back to Kathy for a discussion of our first quarter results. Kathy?", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Thank you, Patty. As summarized on Chart 1, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter 2013 net earnings of $144 million or $0.26 per diluted share on net sales of $2 billion.", "Turning to our business segments. My comments reviewing the first quarter of 2013 refer to changes from the fourth quarter of 2012. Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 2, 3 and 4. Timberlands contributed $104 million to earnings, $9 million more than in Q4. Western log demand was strong in both export and domestic markets. Log price realizations increased 9%, and log sales volumes rose 7%. The fee harvest in the West was 6% higher.", "Export log sales increased 15%, and this is illustrated on Chart 3. Southern log prices were slightly higher and volumes declined. Wet weather in the South resulted in an 11% decrease in fee harvest volumes. Earnings from Timberland dispositions, this is new data available on Chart 4, were $3 million in Q1. Dispositions were $20 million in Q4 2012.", "Turning to Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $178 million to earnings, $140 million more than in the fourth quarter. EBITDA improved in all business lines. EBITDA by business line can be found on Chart 5.", "The strong lumber and OSB demand experienced in the fourth quarter continued through the first quarter. OSB price realizations increased $69 or $0.24 -- 24% to $359 per thousand square feet. Lumber price realizations increased $74 or 20% to $444 per thousand board feet. Lumber sales volumes were flat and OSB volumes were 2% lower.", "Sales volumes in Q4 were very high on a seasonal basis. Price and volumes increased for engineered Wood Products. Solid section prices were up 2% and sales volumes 19%. I-Joist prices rose 3% and production 16%. Operating rates increased across all product lines. Raw material costs were higher.", "Cellulose Fibers, Charts 7 and 8. Cellulose Fibers contributed $31 million to earnings, $30 million less than in the fourth quarter. Scheduled maintenance costs increased to $62 million from $45 million, and the number of annual outage days doubled to 12. In addition to annually schedule maintenance outages, there were projects to lengthen the mill maintenance cycle from 12 to 18 months. Fiber costs increased due to wet weather in the South. Average pulp price realizations declined slightly. Pulp sales volumes increased 2%. Production decreased due to the scheduled maintenance outages.", "Real Estate, Charts 9, 10 and 11. In the seasonally weak first quarter, Real Estate was slightly better than breakeven. This compares to a loss of $8 million in the same quarter last year. Earnings of $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 included an unusually high level of land and lot sales.", "As illustrated on Chart 11, earnings from land and lot sales were $65 million in Q4 and less than $1 million in Q1. 463 homes were closed in Q1, 1/3 more homes enclosed in the first quarter last year. First quarter closings were down from the seasonally strong fourth quarter when 842 homes were closed. The average closing price increased to $394,000, an increase of $13,000 in the quarter.", "The gross margin declined slightly to 19.5% from 20% in Q4. The decline was due to mix and raw material costs. At the end of the first quarter, the backlog of homes sold but not closed increased 46% to 1,131 homes from 744 homes at the end of Q4. The average sales price of homes in the backlog also increased.", "Unallocated, Chart 12. The elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO was an expense of $24 million. This was due to an increase in log and lumber prices and volumes. The unallocated corporate function expense was $5 million lower. Unallocated share-based compensation expense increased by $4 million due to a higher stock price during the quarter.", "I'll now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. First quarter results exceeded our expectations, led by continued improvement in our Wood Products segment and in our Timberland segment.", "Our Wood Products business benefited from strong lumber and OSB prices. In addition, our ongoing focus on earnings improvement initiatives allowed us to take full advantage of improving markets. Our Timberlands business benefited from an improving U.S. housing market and strong export demand.", "We're realizing the significant operating leverage that comes with housing market improvement. Our steadily improving operating results, coupled with our outlook for continued housing recovery, led our board earlier this month to increase our dividend. Combined with an increase just 6 months ago, this represents a total increase of 33% since October 2012.", "Before I discuss the performance of our business segments, I'll provide a brief comment on select economic conditions that affect our company. First, the U.S. housing market. The U.S. housing market continues its recovery towards long-term trend demand levels. I'll cite a few statistics that help to inform our discussion of operating results during the quarter, as well as our outlook for next quarter.", "Though our primary focus for our company is on new construction, we look at the overall housing market, both existing homes as well as new homes, to better understand and respond to longer-term supply-and-demand balance. Sales of existing homes have increased year-over-year, leading to a drop in inventory. We now have less than a 5-month supply of existing homes, a level not seen since 2005.", "Sales of new homes continued to increase, but we are still less than 40% of peak levels of 2006. New home inventory at the end of March was less than a 4.5-month supply of today's level of sales.", "The drop in available home inventory is leading to price increases in most markets and increasing demand for new homes, resulting in an increase in housing starts. New starts for March, as reported last week, now had moved over 1 million on a seasonally adjusted basis for the first time since the recession. The single-family starts at nearly 628,000.", "Increasing home prices, as I've commented before, begin to rebuild consumer confidence and strengthen household balance sheets. These factors help bring potential home buyers back to the market. For Weyerhaeuser, this trend improves demand in 3 of our 4 business segments.", "Beyond the effect from the U.S. housing market activity on our Timberlands, Wood Products and WRECO business segments, global demand and foreign exchange rates affect our Cellulose Fibers and our Timberlands segments. For the past quarter, we continued to deal with a slow European economy, and Asian markets remained relatively strong. Movement in exchange rates has not been significant enough to have had a material effect on our businesses.", "Now I'll comment on the performance of each of our businesses in the first quarter. In Timberlands, our results primarily reflect improved conditions in the West, with relatively flat performance in the South. Not including the results of land dispositions, total earnings from operations improved 35% compared with the prior quarter and 66% year-over-year.", "In the West, demand increased for both domestic and export markets. As Kathy noted, this activity was reflected in increases in volume, as well as price. Domestic markets are beginning to see the effect of an improving housing market, especially the beginning of a recovery in California.", "Our export demand continues to grow, with total volume up from the prior quarter and year-over-year. Japan remains our largest export market, followed by China and Korea. In the South, first quarter activity was adversely affected by weather, causing harvest levels to decline a bit. Prices moved up slightly due to lessened availability of logs across the region.", "The contrast between Western and Southern markets is dramatic. In the West, we've had the benefit of a strong export market throughout the recession. As a result, industry harvest levels did not decline in parallel with the steep drop in U.S. housing. Southern log markets, by contrast, are more closely tied to U.S. housing levels, so the industry deferred a greater percentage of harvest in the South during the recession. This was especially true of smaller landowners.", "Now as U.S. housing begins to recover, Southern log volumes include more significant amounts of deferred volume as compared with the West, resulting in slower price response to increase domestic demand.", "The positioning of our Western lands allows us to fully realize the opportunity to supply strong export markets, as well as to serve recovering domestic demand. In the South, we're well positioned to meet increasing demand as log markets improve.", "We highlighted in the earnings release that our Wood Products segment experienced its most profitable quarter since 2005. By comparison, at that time, total housing starts were over 2 million, and our sales volumes were roughly double today's level. Market conditions in the first quarter improved in line with the recovery in U.S. housing, driven especially by increased prices for lumber and OSB. Our scale and the earnings improvement initiatives allowed us to take full advantage of the opportunity.", "Earnings from this segment increased significantly from the prior quarter, as well as year-over-year. We've noted in prior discussions that our engineered wood business is the most reliant on new residential construction. With the recovery of housing, volumes for engineered TJIs and engineered solids increased notably during the quarter.", "Realizations for all products were up over the prior quarter, with the most significant increase in lumber and OSB. Operating rates improved as we ran better, though the benefit of improved pricing and operating rates was dampened slightly by higher raw material costs in the West, as well as issues in Canada related to rail car availability and the late takeaway by traders in the South. These factors, taken together, resulted in inventory build-up at quarter end.", "Our operating results reflect better market conditions, as well as continued progress on improving our operations through initiatives to grow revenue and to reduce costs.", "Moving to WRECO. All of our markets continued to improve, and we're clearly on a path to recovery. Let me highlight some key statistics for the quarter. First, community count. As the market continues to recover, you should expect our community count to increase in response to improved demand. During the first quarter, we opened 16 new communities while closing out 4.", "Next, traffic. During the quarter, our traffic count increased significantly year-over-year, which leads to new sales. Our sales increased 18% year-over-year. Closings during the first quarter are seasonally low, but total closings increased year-over-year, reflecting last year's increased sales activity.", "Our backlog is the number of sold but unclosed homes at any time. Included in backlog are homes that may already be complete, homes at various stages of construction, as well as homes for which construction has not yet begun.", "With the continued pickup in market activity, our inventory of completed but unsold homes has continued to fall. As a result, an increased percentage of our backlog represents homes not yet under construction. As Kathy noted, at the end of the quarter, our backlog had increased significantly. These backlog homes will be delivered over the next 3 quarters.", "Average home prices in our backlog are a function of both timing of the sales contract, as well as geographic and product mix. Average price in backlog at the end of the first quarter increased, and prices for new orders during the quarter were greater than that for the prior quarter. This points to steady but modest increases in prices across our regions.", "In earlier calls I've noted that Washington D.C., followed by Phoenix, were some of the first markets to begin to show signs of recovery. Last year, Las Vegas began to wake up, and finally, our Southern California markets bounced back to life in the fourth quarter with significant increases year-over-year. Assuming that our competitors are having similar success, these new sales are a very positive signal of future improvement in our Western Wood Products and Timberland businesses.", "While improved traffic sales and price increases are all positive signs, all homebuilders face challenges during this recovery. First, one would typically expect the increased demand and reduced supply to lead to price increases. However, increases are hampered today by today's tighter underwriting rules and the ability of appraisers to keep pace with changes in market pricing. In rising markets, sales comps for these increased prices aren't available.", "Second, land and lot prices are increasing as the existing inventory of finished lots are depleted. New lots need to be entitled, permitted and improved to keep up with demand.", "Third, construction costs are increasing as cost of materials increase and availability of materials and labor are limited, as an entire industry is in the process of going back to work. Leading the way on cost increases are OSB and lumber.", "It is difficult for builders, who, like us, begin construction of most of our homes only after locking in a contract price for a home to totally protect ourselves from these cost increases. The challenge is to maintain and grow margin in the face of these increases, as price increases are limited by factors I noted above. Over time, market demand and supply should adjust to these changes, but compared with the conditions that we faced over the past 5-plus years, these are challenges that we welcome.", "My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers segment. Overall market conditions for fluff and liquid packaging were relatively stable in the quarter, with fluff prices still essentially flat and NBSK prices slowly improving. The euro was relatively stable during the quarter, and global softwood pulp inventories are at the high end of a normal range, up slightly from year end.", "Our earnings for the quarter were lower as a result of planned maintenance scheduled at our Port Wentworth mill and additional costs incurred for scheduled major maintenance projects at several mills as we move to an 18-month interval between scheduled maintenance outages.", "Additional unfavorable cost during the quarter was a result of higher fiber costs, seasonally higher energy costs for natural gas and fuel usage and lower electricity prices in Canada where we sell energy to the grid.", "During the quarter, we continued with our strategy to grow with our global customers. We began production and product qualification at our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland. The grand opening ceremony for the facility will be held next month. We expect to generate our first commercial sales by the end of the second quarter.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss our second quarter outlook, as well as provide financial highlights.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thanks, Dan. The outlook for the second quarter of this year is summarized on Chart 13. I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.", "In the West, the strong export markets that we experienced in the first quarter are expected to continue. Japanese housing starts this year are running ahead of last year, and some projects continue to be delayed by the carpenter shortage, pushing the backlog of housing orders further into 2013, contributing to strong log sales through Q2.", "In China, inventory of North American logs are lower than the same period last year. Log prices moved up in March, and these strong prices are continuing into this quarter, aided by an improving U.S. domestic market. Heavy April shipments from the Pacific Northwest, combined with record shipments of New Zealand radiata pine in Q1, may tend to dampen further upward price movement in Q2, but we expect these markets to remain strong.", "Domestic log prices have increased during April in response to strong lumber markets. Western fee harvest volumes are anticipated to be slightly lower. In the South, realizations for pine grade logs are expected to be flat, and fee harvest volumes will increase somewhat now that the wet weather is receding. Costs for both West and South are anticipated to increase seasonally due to higher silviculture-related spending.", "Before considering nonstrategic land sales, Timberland earnings are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales are anticipated to be somewhat higher than Q1 where we had income of $3 million.", "In Wood Products, zen [ph] channel inventories, combined with a seasonally stronger demand, are expected to drive low double-digit sales volume increases across all major product lines. Adverse effects from unexpected weather events, combined with Canadian rail transportation issues, should subside. We expect sales realizations for engineered Wood Products to increase slightly, while there may be some potential for softening in lumber and OSB prices as more supply enters the market.", "Log costs are anticipated to increase especially in the West, partially offset by improved operating rates. We continue our focus on operational improvements, including product strategies and customer selection, as well as manufacturing efficiencies. We expect another strong earnings performance for the Wood Products segment in the second quarter, with overall results comparable to the first quarter.", "In Cellulose Fibers, sales realizations are expected to increase slightly as the markets slowly improve. We anticipate lower maintenance, fiber and energy costs. We have fewer major maintenance projects scheduled this quarter, as we continue on track for the transition to an 18-month interval between scheduled maintenance outages, which should be completed by 2014. As Dan said, we are on schedule with the qualification process at our newly constructed Poland converting facility, and we anticipate completing qualification by the end of this quarter. Overall, second quarter earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should be significantly improved compared to the first quarter.", "In our Real Estate segment, markets continue to gain momentum as low inventories, rising home prices, pent-up demand and historically low interest rates are motivating buyers. Prospective buyers are attracted to fresh new product designs and new communities. As Dan mentioned, our community count is increasing, and we are likely to end the quarter with operating 81 communities.", "During the second quarter, we expect to close approximately 600 homes compared to 463 homes in the first quarter. The average closing price for this quarter is anticipated to be slightly lower due to mix, although input prices or costs are rising, average margin should be comparable to the first quarter. Given the higher closing volume, we expect higher selling costs. Overall, we expect a slight profit in our single-family homebuilding business in the second quarter, and we do not anticipate any significant land or lot sale.", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. During these comments, I'll be discussing items that are included on Chart 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of nearly $640 million, a decrease of approximately $260 million compared to year end. Consistent with our normal seasonal pattern and because of the strength of our Wood Products sales, we used cash from operations to build working capital.", "We had total capital expenditures of about $48 million during the quarter, and we expect total expenditures for the year to be up to $300 million. Given our improved operating results, coupled with our strong liquidity and valuable mix of timberlands holdings, Moody's announced earlier this week that they have upgraded our credit rating. We are investment grade rated by both Moody's, as well as S&P.", "We retired nearly $160 million of debt during the quarter. We have remaining maturity this year of just over $250 million, well below our existing cash balance, with no significant additional debt repayments until 2017.", "In addition, we have an unused line of credit totaling $1 billion. Our net debt-to-enterprise value was 17% as of the end of the quarter. As Dan previously discussed, earlier this month, our board increased our quarterly dividend to shareholders from $0.17 to $0.20 per share, underscoring our commitment to a sustainable dividend that we intend to continue to grow over time.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. Overall, I'm pleased with our financial performance during the quarter, and I'm optimistic about our ability to continue to improve our operational results as the housing market remains on a path to return to trend levels of demand and global markets stabilize for our Cellulose Fibers segment.", "In our Timberlands segment, we're well-positioned to capitalize on improving domestic markets, while taking full advantage of our competitive strengths in accessing high-value export markets from our Western Timberlands. We have an added benefit that comes from our extensive mineral rights, which generate revenue from oil, gas and other resources.", "In our Wood Products segment, we have the widest range of wood products of anyone in the industry, all of which will be needed to construct new housing units as the U.S. housing continues to recover. Our lumber and OSB businesses showed their potential during the quarter. As new construction continues to increase, we expect to see improved results from our engineered Wood Products and distribution businesses.", "Our WRECO business is filling its backlog pipeline for new homes to be delivered over the balance of the year. As we continue on our planned path to increase our total community count by nearly 20% this year, I'm encouraged by the interest of new buyers who are visiting our model homes and signing new contracts at increasing prices.", "In our Cellulose Fibers segment, as Patty noted in her outlook, a slight recovery in pulp prices, together with reduced maintenance, fiber and energy expense, are expected to result in significantly higher earnings in the second quarter. We'll continue with our strategy to grow with our global customers by innovating to create differentiated products that benefit our key existing customers while attracting new ones.", "An example of these differentiated products is our new cellulose-based composite, THRIVE, which is now planned to be used as an interior part of a new 2014 Lincoln model which will hit the market later this fall.", "In closing, we had good solid performance in the quarter, and yet we still have opportunity for continued improvement. We've made great progress in improving the strength of our balance sheet while rewarding shareholders with another increase in our dividend. And we're well-positioned to capture the opportunities that will come as we continue on a path of economic recovery.", "And now we welcome your questions and comments.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Would you please open the floor to questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wondered -- first of all, on the Wood Products business, can you give us a sense of kind of what your estimated operating rates are in those different businesses?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Sure. For the first quarter, Mark, our lumber and OSB businesses were operating at about a 90% rate. And in our engineered Wood Products business, we saw a significant increase in operating rate so that we're now operating in the mid-40% range for our I-Joist facilities and mid-50% range for our solids.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And Dan, can you also talk about anything that you might be doing to kind of add more capacity, whether it's just picking up another shift or perhaps restarting capacity or maybe even thinking about a little incremental capital?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Yes, a couple of comments, Mark. We are -- we do have the ability in our lumber mills to add hours and, to some extent, add shifts. All of our lumber facilities are operating today. In our oriented strand board business, all of our mills are operating. And we are increasing shifts in some cases, so there's some additional flex capacity in our solid or engineered wood business. We still have 2 curtailed facilities. And as the market continues to recover, we have the ability to bring them back. As anyone in the industry restarts capacity, there's a long lead time. And so we are positioning our facilities so that, at the right time, we can bring them back to meet demand. One of the surprises, I think, in the industry, has been how long it takes to bring back mills that have been shut down, both because of the availability of labor that's qualified, the ability to fill a log yard and to operate smoothly. So we have flex capacity to respond. And as the market continues to improve, we're well-positioned.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And I just...", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Mark, I just might add that the engineered wood operating rates that Dan gave you did include those 2 closed facilities. So if we were to back those out and just use our existing facilities, that would be closer to the mid- to high-60% ratio. So those operating rates, as Dan said, are continuing to move up. I think, also, as you think about our capital spending, which I referenced was -- could be up to $300 million for this year, which is similar to what we spent last year. But the mix of where we spend that will be very different from last year, given that, in last year, we were finishing our converting facility in Poland, so we were spending more in Cellulose Fibers last year than we will this year. And we will also be putting more money to work in Wood Products, especially in our lumber business, to look at low capital, but still capital solutions where we can bring on additional capacity as we need it, adding a dry kiln here and there so that we can process more of the green lumber that we can produce at some of our facilities. So you'll see a little shift in mix that is not huge increments, but across our 18-mill set, does add up as we put those dollars to work.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could -- just a follow-up on your Timberland business, you highlighted that dichotomy between kind of the Western situation and the Southern situation, what are your expectations about kind of price and volume in the South as we kind of move through the year? And when do you think this pickup in housing and Wood Products prices is going to start to flow through to Southern log and timber prices?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, we think it will come, but we can't call the timing, Mark. As I mentioned, there was more deferral in the South. And so as markets pick up, clearly, the Wood Products production is increasing. So the deferral wood in the South is benefiting the margins of wood products producers, whereas in the West, it's a much stronger log market. So it will just be one that we have to watch over time, and very difficult to call the timing of when that market tensions because there are so many landowners that are -- have the ability to bring logs to market.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But fair to say, you think it may be a little longer than normal lag in the South this time around before this starts to flow back to the stump?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I'm not sure what a normal lag is. I mean, I think we've been through an extraordinary period with this housing recession, and so we don't have experience with this amount of deferral. But I would expect, with the pace of recovery in housing, that there'll be opportunity.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes. So, Mark, I think we've already experienced a little longer than a normal lag...", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, yes, I agree, Patty. It's not been a normal downturn.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes. So I think we'll -- those prices will start to move probably some time more in the latter half of this year than what we've seen at this point. So I don't think it's a long ways away, but we'll be ready for it when it comes.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "All right, we all will.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "By the way, not to join the bandwagon, but I noticed this was the third quarter in a row where you didn't have any adjustments to between GAAP and reported earnings and the first time you've had 3 in a row since 1998, so congratulations.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thanks, Chip. I'm glad that you noticed.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Oh, yes, absolutely. Listen, the first question -- this has been a long time coming. The first question is on the Cellulose business. I know you sort of gave us the view that there will be substantial improvement. And as you know, that number can jump around considerably, excluding any price impacts. So if we made -- I don't know what you're assuming, whether this current round of pricing -- price announcements go through or not, but could you just give us a little -- a better guidance in terms of what the movement might be if we exclude any pricing impact from first to second quarter?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, maybe the way to think about it, Chip, would be, if you think about where we would expect that business to be in the second quarter, given the assumptions that I had in my outlook, that I would say that it will be much closer to the $60 million that we earned in the fourth quarter than in the $31 million that we moved in this quarter.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then second follow-up is on the Wood Products business. I know your guidance is for flat, and it's really tough with pricing moving around the way it is. It just seems like in the past that often when there is a sudden movement about the time of the call, and it's not fair because your people couldn't have looked at randomly last night, for example, and then reacted to it. But it would seem to me that if we see a continuation of softer lumber prices in the next 3 or 4 weeks that maybe that would prove high, but maybe you could comment on that sensitivity. And maybe if I turn it around and said if we do see a bottom by the end of, let's say, by mid to late May, in a turnaround, could that number actually be up?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I guess the best way to answer your question is to think about conditions in the channels, Chip, because this is really a behavioral issue as much as anything. Channels are very tight, and with prices as high as they have been, most in the channel have been reluctant to take significant inventory positions, but the orders continue to come in because new home construction is picking up. And so the real question is, to the extent that there's softness, how long, how deep? And since the inventory levels are relatively low, I think what we may find is something similar to what happened in the fourth quarter, where the orders were coming in and so the distributors and the builders put their orders in and reentered the market. So it's really going to be a behavioral issue, I think, as much as anything. And it's all really just flow back to demand levels and construction. So I think you have to look at construction levels for some guidance there, and I wouldn't want to speculate about price movement.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And you're not concerned about inventories being elevated at the very end -- at the builder level because we've seen so many strong months?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Help me a little bit with your question. Inventory levels at the builder level? Inventories...", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Yes, your end customer. Yes, exactly, the guys that are actually using the stuff now.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Channels seem to be relatively thin.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "And finished inventory for builders is very low, as I commented. And so as those new orders come in, construction will pick up, and it starts with the lumber drop and panels. And so we would expect building activity based upon all of the statistics, starts, permits to be continuing to increase through the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel.", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I'm wondering if you guys can talk about any of the possible supply pinch points that you may see cropping up or are seeing today? Dan, I think you mentioned something that I think a lot of us just look at strangely, which is the engineered business seems to be operating at pretty low operating rates and generally would follow the single-family business, whereas lumber and OSBs had multi-year highs. Can you talk about, I guess, anything that's affecting that today and where you think that could possibly continue if the supply and demand continues where it is for the rest of the year?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, by product type, the engineered products, as we've talked before, are primarily reliant on new construction. And so I think that we have a significant position in both I-beams, as well as solids, and that product does flow into new construction, and so we expect new construction activity to continue to pick up, and I think that that's a positive. We saw that move just in the quarter in the change in operating rate in that business more significant, really, than what it was for our lumber or our panel business. Multiple outlets for lumber, both new construction, repair and remodel, all of that looks positive; and in industrial, a bit. And then panels, primarily going into new construction, but that's also singles and it's multis. The big question in the industry is probably facilities that are -- that had not been operating that are coming back online. And I think that the -- that there's -- people underestimate the challenge of bringing the facility back if it's been shut down for some period of time. So there is -- there will be supply that will come online to meet demand, but I think that the supply response is a bit delayed and trying to catch up to demand.", "Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess, also, as these markets get better and better, and especially on the homebuilding side where we're seeing some really excellent valuations, would you guys be inclined, I think, at some point, to consider spinning off or selling perhaps WRECO, given the valuations that a number of the other builders are trading at?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We're focused on operating our businesses as well as we can and continuing to take advantage of the opportunity presented to us with market recovery. So our focus is on operations. In our homebuilding business, we're well-positioned because we do have a land position to build on. We're in great markets, and they're all showing really robust recovery at this point. So we're going to take advantage of that in our operations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I wanted to pick up on WRECO as well. And certainly, you're seeing progress. But, for example, the closings in the quarter were, I think, a little bit below where you had guided in the prior quarter. I think at one point in time, you had said you were looking for 500 closings. So I was wondering what might have created the variance there if that was a correct recollection. And also, Dan, I mean we're seeing, from our scan of the homebuilding regions, California has been very, very strong. Texas had been very, very strong. These are areas where you are certainly very strong from a regional standpoint. I'm just curious why we're not yet seeing the lift in your margin within WRECO. And then I had a couple of follow-ons.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "The margin question is, I mean, to some extent, it's a mix issue among markets. We have different margins by market, different margins by product type. We've historically guided that we should expect gross margins in the low-20% range. This quarter, we were at 19.5%. That was a bit of a mix issue between a more attached product in the Washington, D.C. area and coming off some higher margin projects in the Las Vegas area. Sales, as you know, in California had been very strong. As I look at our first quarter activity, the real strength year-over-year was in L.A. Ventura, which had been a soft market. It was the Inland Empire, it was San Diego and it was Las Vegas. So those have been the last markets to come back. There is a lag in when those homes are delivered. So the sales that we took contracts on in the first quarter will be delivered over the second, third and fourth quarter, depending upon the complexity of the home. As I noted in my comments, a lot of these are to-be-built houses, and so there's a bit more of a lag. And so we would expect that we'll have a stronger back half of the year, as we always do, at WRECO. I did note, and I wanted to spend some time talking about cost increases because they are factors for everyone in the industry. As you noted, I led off with OSB and lumber, so that's not a bad thing for Weyerhaeuser Company. But there are increased costs, and there is a process as cost increases and we pass that through to the ultimate homebuyer where there's a bit of a lag. So you should expect prices to continue to rise. Our focus is not just on maintaining margins, but growing margins. So -- and you talked about Texas. Texas was not quite as strong, first quarter, but last month or so, it has really picked up. So we're really pleased with the markets that we're in. We think we have the ability to maintain the margins that we've had in the past, but there are mix issues quarter-to-quarter. And that business is traditionally back-ended in terms of deliveries, much more heavy in the third and fourth quarter.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Dan, you've mentioned for a number of quarters the, I'll put it as the affordable housing element in your mix that's been keeping margins perhaps below where you'd like them to be. When does that, if you will, cycle through? And are you finding that as you're needing to purchase land, if there are scenarios like this, that you need to continue to commit to a certain level of affordable housing as you purchase these new lots, and in turn, that's keeping a lid on margin? And the other question I had and I'll turn it over, and I think you're alluding to this, as I look at your backlog pricing, it seems to show up in your -- your selling price on a closed home is usually within a couple of quarters. So these $440,000 levels you've been at the last couple of quarters, these more or less should be showing up in the back half? Would that be your expectation?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Let me start with the last question. The higher-priced homes that we have generally are -- some of them are in San Diego, and some are in the Washington, D.C. metro area for our Winchester and Camberley brands. We had the longest lead time on those Washington, D.C. homes because they have more customization, and so there is a cycle time for them that maybe 6 to 9 months as compared to a shorter cycle time for it. The other extreme would be a townhome that we're building in the Inland Empire. So there is some lag that you observed. With respect to land and lot prices, lot prices had been moving up relatively quickly. We clearly are -- we are restocking our pipeline for current projects. Those prices had moved, but we would not expect that, that would lead to a significant degradation of margin. You talked about the -- asked about the affordable housing units. That's a function primarily in that Washington, D.C. metro area. It happens in larger communities of more than 50 units, and we try to point that out when we see those closings come through. That was not an issue in the last quarter. Last quarter was just a shift to more of a townhome product, which is lower priced as compared to higher-priced single families. So we can try to guide you a bit on those affordables. When they do occur, it normally occurs where there's significant number of closings at one time because we turn those houses over to a regional housing authority and they handle the sales activity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "There were a couple of reports in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times earlier this week talking about the tax treatment of REITs, and the Journal specifically was talking about Congress taking a look at that pretty hard. I'm just wondering, can you give any comments from what you know about what's going on? Is there anything kind of out of the usual there? And most specifically, how it might drill down the timber REIT versus maybe a more traditional REIT?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, there had been a series of articles that you've noted that have discussed some recent conversions or some planned conversions, including some nontraditional real estate. So I think that they are all consistent with the current tax law. As we look at broad tax reform, I think Congress, if they take a broad look on tax treatment, they talk about all aspects of the code, including a discussion of corporate tax, personal tax, LLCs, pass-through entities, as well as REITs. The National REIT Organization is well-organized. They have broad constituency across the country. I think that the REIT structure has worked very well for a long period of time. Because of the way it's structured, the REITs generate income. That income is distributed to individual shareholders and they pay taxes. So I can't speculate on what Congress might or may not do in any tax reform, but we pay attention to it, and the National REIT Organization is well-positioned to deal with those questions.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one other quick question. Going sort of back to Chip's question on Wood Products, I just want to make sure I understand, or can you just clarify what you think is causing the weakness in wood product prices that we've seen over the last couple of weeks?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I can't comment on market reaction to prices. Prices have been very high. And I think that at today's levels, that creates some level of caution. But the product is needed. And ultimately, as I come back in my discussion, you have to look at the channel. The channel is relatively thin. If the orders are coming in, they'll get filled and prices will be settled at market. And I can't comment on, quite frankly, the direction because it's a function of supply-demand. I feel really good about the demand side.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Gail, as you know, prices -- volatility and prices for both lumber and OSB are not surprising. That usually does happen, and prices did move up in the first quarter. So to think that they're going to just continue to move up forever would certainly be a mistake...", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "No, I guess I was just wondering if there's a sense that maybe more supply was finally making its way back into the market and even tension a little bit, but...", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes. I think that as the demand increases, we will need more of that supply. So the fact that more supply is coming on is just kind of the natural order of things. I don't think there's -- if you're talking about a real big shift, a big fundamental shift from supply-demand balance, I don't think that there's a huge piece. I think what we're seeing here is just more of the normal kind of reaction that we see.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions for you. I think you're going to start to face some high-quality problems in the near future, specifically with the balance sheet. With the EBITDA improving and the cash flow generation picking up, it seems to me the leverage ratio will start to really drop pretty quickly. So can you remind us again how you think about the efficient leverage in the business and what you expect to do to stay in front of the balance sheet becoming inefficient?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes, Alex. What we have said is that for this size of company, that we would think that gross debt of -- or at about $4 billion would be something that would make sense for us. At the end of this year, we'll certainly be there where they're on a net debt basis today. I think that what you point out is that because of the strength of the balance sheet, because of the strength of the improvement in markets and also our own operating performance, that we are experiencing -- as you call it a high-class problem, I call it a great opportunity to take advantage of things that are out in front of us. And so those are the kinds of things that we look at in terms of what is the right leverage, what is the right capital allocation. You've heard us talk about this morning both in terms of investing in our businesses, returning cash to shareholders. And all of those things are things that we are reviewing on an ongoing basis. So I think the future does look very exciting, and those kinds of problems I like a lot better than the ones that we've seen behind us.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. And switching to the Wood Products business, can you talk about what you believe the strategic rationale to have a distribution business tied back into the manufacturing businesses is?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Sure. With distribution, for us, it's always helpful to provide a little bit of history. Today, our distribution business is a significant channel for our engineered Wood Products business, plus we do flow some lumber, especially our higher-grade lumber Framer Series and differentiated products, as well as some of our higher-value OSB. We also, in that business, distribute products for third parties. So we have some third-party element of distribution because we've got the infrastructure in place to serve our customers in the homebuilding business, and they need not just our products but others. And so there are some complementary products. We have a business that historically had more scale. We scaled it back when we changed our operating model and went to a brand called iLevel about 5 years ago. And in that time, we eliminated most of our third-party distribution and focused on being a channel for our own products, really made that business uneconomic. And so we noted that, that wasn't working for us. We shifted it back to a standalone business, and so you'd see the results where we account for is a separate P&L. We've got a scale of footprint that allows us to flex with an improving market, and we have a lot of operating leverage in that businesses as we see housing recovery. So it serves as a channel for not all of our product, but some of our product, as well as third party gives us an opportunity to provide some additional marketing services especially for our engineered Wood Products. And we are looking forward to the opportunity to have that business take advantage of its scale and operating leverage as the market recovers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I had a quick follow-up on WRECO. You talked about a stronger back half of the year but also some mix headwinds and price bottlenecks. And I guess when you look at the business broadly, I think WRECO earned about $100 million last year, with a large land sale impacting that in the fourth quarter. When you think about the earnings potential of the business for full year 2013, would you envision the business would earn a similar amount? Would it -- would you expect it to earn significantly more or slightly more? Or could it actually earn less, given the large land sale last year? And I understand you don't give full year guidance, but sort of any kind of color on that would be very helpful.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Well, you're right, we don't provide full year guidance, so I appreciate you recognizing that. We did have a significant land sale last year of some nonstrategic land in San Diego, which is land with a product type that we don't build. We always have some of that. It's part of our land development strategy, especially with our Southern California operation. As we look at 2013, full year, what we are expecting is a significant shift in mix in our earnings that will be much more heavily weighted towards our housing business. There may be some land sales, but we are not projecting them. We're an opportunistic seller, both nonstrategic land that might be zoned for products that we don't build, but we also have, in some cases, residential lots that -- where we have the option to either build them on ourselves or to sell them to others if we have the right price. So I think that the major story for WRECO 2012 versus 2013 will be a shift in income away from just land sales, not just land sales, but heavyweight the land sales to a much higher weighting of a single-family.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I think also, Anthony, as you think about WRECO coming out of 2012 into 2013, I think as Dan gave in his comments, we ended the year with a very low community count in WRECO at 62. We'll be at 81 at the end of the second quarter. So there's a little bit of a flywheel effect, if you will, of low inventory at the end of 2012, as we weren't sure about where the California markets were headed. So that flywheel is going to work. You're seeing it now in the backlog. Although, as what's discussed earlier, most of those homes don't get delivered until the back half of 2013. So as you noted, we won't give full year guidance, but it will be significantly better, and better than our normal seasonal pattern because of that flywheel effect of low inventories at 2000 -- end of 2012, and now going to work in 2013 back half.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carly Mattson with Goldman Sachs.", "Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Following the company's return into a full investment grade, could you talk to whether Weyerhaeuser will consider looking to refinance its higher-coupon debt or what types of consideration the company takes into account when it's thinking about that decision?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Carly, yes, absolutely. We would love to refinance some of that higher-coupon debt. It really is a function of what premium would have to be paid in order to do that in the economic tradeoff. So we look at that on a very regular basis. And when that makes sense for us to do, that would be a great thing to do. But right now, from an economic standpoint, it doesn't make sense.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "First, just the intersegment elimination LIFO inventory that was in the corporate, I assume that goes away next quarter, and so that corporate goes back down to more like a $20 million number. Is that generally speaking right?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes, Mark. It is unusually high for 2 reasons: one, typically, from a seasonal perspective, that number would be higher at the end of the first quarter because of our normal inventory build. But given the strength of Wood Products, we certainly had a little more working capital than maybe even a normal seasonal pattern would be. And then as we sell down that working capital over the course of the year, that will turn around and come back, so that the pattern of the unallocated segment will be closer to as you just described it. We try and take all of these anomalies and put them in this unallocated item and give you full visibility in terms of the detail of what's in there. So you can track that volatility. But you've got the pattern right. Just as you can see in the fourth quarter, we actually had pickup from LIFO and intercompany profit.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And all that -- by the way, I do appreciate the additional disclosure in general. It's very helpful. Second, as you're making more money from the Wood Products and the homebuilder hopefully soon, can you help us in how to do the tax rate? It came off a little off from my tax rate. Is there kind of a rule-of-thumb way to be able to get to the tax rate?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, it really is, as we've talked about before, a function of how you think about the mix of earnings. So the mix in the Timberlands business that is in the REIT, of course, is a 0 tax rate. And as we look at the TRS, those have a normal kind of tax rate. I would think about something around the 34%, 35% rate for that mix of income. Now we had a higher tax rate maybe than what you would have thought, given the fact that we had a higher Wood Products income in the TRS than what a number of people were thinking about in the model. So it really is a function of the TRS versus the REIT. And then also, not all the Timberlands earnings are REIT-qualified. We do some merchandising of our logs in the TRS portion of the Timberlands business, and so we did have income in the TRS from Timberlands that would be subject to the tax.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And then lastly, Dan, you referenced housing going back towards trend levels of demand over time. At this juncture, having had a couple of years to think about it, where do you think trend levels of demand for housing, single-family and total, what do you think is the right number for trend levels?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I continue to follow the long-term trend numbers that are generated by the Joint Center for Housing at Harvard. They're not a forecaster. They just look at long-term demographics, starting with population, household formation. And there's a headship assumption there's the repair or the replacement for destroyed units, and then the wildcard in their estimates is immigration. So they would have a range of 1.6 million to 1.9 million, Mark, with the biggest question being the impact of immigration, which can move numbers by 100,000 or more or so. As I think about it, I think, generally, 1.6 million to 1.8 million is a trend number over a 10-year period. There are periods when you would expect housing starts and deliveries to be greater than that, and then obviously, we're coming off of a very deep trough. I think we've been underbuilding for some period of time. The question or the mix between singles and multis is being debated a little bit just as demographics change, but I quite frankly don't expect a very significant shift. I think we'll see a gradual move to higher-density housing over time just because of the continued urbanization of population. But as I note, we're a long way from those trend numbers. And it really is about household formations, and we're going to go through a period of accelerated formation now just because household formations have been so low. Household formations are about 1.2 million a year, 1.2 million on average.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And as you think about -- if you have those types of long-term trend numbers that, that might call for one type of investment strategy in your underlying business. At the same time, you said that we're pretty far away from those numbers. Are you going to be much more of the mindset to actually begin to really see evidence of it, of these much higher housing-type numbers before starting to commit significantly more capital, recognizing that you maybe a little bit late doing it that way? Or are you going to be inclined to get out in front of it because you're confident it's coming?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "I think the timing is a question, and I think that there's-- we're going to be cautious. As we've come through this recession, it was just last year that California housing started to pick up, and that's a very significant market, not just for us, but for the entire country. I think that, directionally, we want to be operating the facilities that we have today as best we can, make them as efficient as possible, get the most return that we can from them. We've got opportunities with modest investment to continue to improve operations of our existing facilities. And we will focus on what we've got in front of us rather than, I think, getting out with significant new capacity. New capacity will come back, but I think the entire industry is going to be operating much more efficiently than we were in the prior cycle. I commented earlier that, as we noted in our release, this was our best quarter for Wood Products since 2005, and yet, we did it on half the volume. And so I think not just us, but the industry is going to be more efficient, and we'll react as the demand emerges.", "Well, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your attendance, and we appreciate your interest in Weyerhaeuser Company.", "I want to remind everybody on the call that we'll be hosting our annual investor conference in New York.

Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. On the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a GAAP reconciliation can be found in the package.", "Joining me this morning to discuss second quarter results are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Doyle Simons, CEO elect, is also with us this morning. Doyle becomes President and Chief Executive Officer on August 1. I know you are looking forward to hearing from Doyle, but the purpose of this call is to focus on second quarter earnings and performance.", "As summarized on Chart 1, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter 2013 net earnings to common shareholders of $196 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion.", "Turning to our business segments, my comments reviewing the second quarter 2013 refer to changes from the first quarter of 2013.", "Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 2, 3, 4. Timberlands contributed $114 million through earnings, $10 million more than in the first quarter. The disposition of non-strategic Timberlands in Q2 was $14 million. Non-strategic Timberlands dispositions were $3 million in Q1. Export demand continued strong as export log sales rose 27%. Western log price realizations increased 9%. Both export and domestic prices were higher.", "Southern log price realizations were flat. Fee harvest volumes declined 4% in the West and were essentially flat in the South. Road and silviculture expenses seasonally increased.", "Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $136 million to earnings, $42 million less than in Q1. During the quarter, lumber sales volumes increased 13% and oriented strand board sales volumes rose 3%.", "Price realizations declined 8% for OSB, and lumber price realizations were slightly lower. Engineered wood product volumes were flat, while prices increased 4% for both solid section and TJIs. Log costs were higher in the West. Manufacturing costs increased due to downtime and repairs associated with the fire of our Arcadia, Louisiana OSB mill.", "Engineered wood products' maintenance expense was higher than normal, and raw material cost increased. Margins in the distribution business were adversely affected by the steep drop in commodity prices during the quarter.", "Cellulose Fibers, Charts 7 and 8. Cellulose Fibers contributed $57 million to Q2 earnings, $26 million more than in Q1. Scheduled maintenance costs were $7 million lower than in the previous quarter. There were 12 annual outage days. Higher productivity resulted in a 4% increase in pulp production. Energy fiber and chemical costs were lower. Slightly higher electricity sales at Grande Prairie also contributed to lower manufacturing costs.", "Real Estate, Charts 9, 10 and 11. Real Estate contributed $14 million to earnings, an increase of $14 million from the seasonally weak first quarter. 636 homes were closed in second quarter, a 25% increase over the same quarter last year and a 37% increase from the first quarter. The single-family growth margin increased to 21.6% due to mix. The average closing price increased 3% to $405,000. At the end of the second quarter, the backlog, the number of homes sold but not closed, rose 27%. Q2 includes $2 million in earnings from land and lot sales.", "Unallocated, Chart 12. Unallocated expense in the quarter netted to 0. The elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO was an expense of $24 million in Q1 compared to a gain of $8 million in Q2. Unallocated share-based compensation was an expense of $7 million in Q1 compared to a gain of $5 million in Q2 due to the change in stock price.", "I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We've had a very busy quarter at Weyerhaeuser. This morning, I'll provide some color on our second quarter performance beyond the specifics that Kathy has just reviewed. In addition, on June 16, we made a series of significant announcements that we discussed in a call on June 17. Following my discussion of second quarter results, I will recap those announcements and provide an update related to those matters.", "Let me first address our second quarter results. I'm pleased to report that earnings for the second quarter increased significantly from the first quarter, more than double last year's second quarter results. As noted in our earnings release, it is a fourfold increase before special items.", "During the quarter, the U.S. economy sent mixed signals. Private sector employment is increasing, partially offset by fiscal contraction. Consumer confidence in June increased to its highest level in 5 years. This is a big factor in bringing buyers back into the housing market.", "As I discussed during our May analyst meeting, we still believe that we're in the early stages of a longer-term return to trend levels of housing starts. Existing home sales continued to improve both in volume and price.", "Retail inventory continues to be limited. New home sales continued to increase, and new home inventory continues to be especially tight. There was less than a 4-month supply available in June.", "Total new housing starts in June were seasonally adjusted 836,000 was a bit of a shift towards the higher percentage of single-family homes. Forecasters now estimate that there will be approximately 1 million starts in 2013. Most projections for 2014 are up an additional 20% to 25%.", "Home prices for both resale and new homes continued to rise in most markets. Both the recent Case-Shiller and National Association of Realtors' indexes report year-over-year increases of 10% to 15%. The greatest uncertainty in the U.S. economy today seems to be the role of the Fed in managing interest rates and the signaling about its strategy to taper asset purchases.", "Global economic activity affects our Cellulose Fibers and Timberlands business segments, and growth remains fragile. The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against the Canadian dollar and the euro, and we've seen a significant weakening in the Japanese yen as a result of government policy designed to spur domestic growth.", "Now I'll comment on the performance in each of our businesses in the second quarter, starting with Timberlands. In Timberlands, as Kathy noted, operating earnings were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, with total earnings up slightly due to disposition of non-strategic Timberlands. In the West, we continued to benefit from our long-term strategy of maximizing returns by leveraging log exports. Japan remains our primary export market, but all of our Pacific Rim markets remained strong, with volume and price increasing in the quarter.", "Our new Longview Timber acquisition is a perfect fit with this strategy, as these acres are well positioned to flow volume to Weyerhaeuser's strategically located Pacific Coast export facilities and then to overseas markets. The market story in the South hasn't changed much from last quarter. Our risk volumes were flat, sales volumes increased slightly and prices remained essentially flat.", "As U.S. housing continues to recover, we expect southern log volumes to gradually improve but with a somewhat slower price response as deferred harvest volume comes back into the market. Our Timberlands operations are focused on extracting the most value from the current market, relying on our low-cost scale harvesting and hauling capabilities, as well as directing our logs to the highest end-use markets.", "In Wood Products, we had another strong quarter, though earnings declined quarter-over-quarter. Wood Products contributed the highest earnings of all of our businesses in the second quarter, $136 million, and delivered $227 million in cash flow.", "Over the last few months, a question frequently asked is whether the market has bottomed. We entered the second quarter with lumber and OSB prices at levels not seen since the top of the last housing boom. Prices peaked in the early weeks of the quarter then fell steeply until bottoming around the end of the quarter. From peak to trough during the quarter, Random Lengths' composite lumber price fell almost 30%, and the Random Lengths Index for 3/8-inch OSB fell over 40%.", "Despite these significant price adjustments during the quarter, year-over-year, our realizations are up over 50% for OSB and almost 25% for lumber. While lower than the peak at the beginning of the second quarter, prices are at a level that provide opportunity for good returns for our Wood Products businesses.", "As I've noted in the past, fundamental demographics and improving consumer confidence are major factors in bringing fires back to the market. Housing is recovering but has a long way to go before reaching trend. Our Wood Product volumes in the second quarter support this point. We had solid volume takeaway across all product lines.", "As we look forward, we continue to be encouraged by the opportunities we have in Wood Products. We're taking advantage of improving demands for our lumber, OSB and Engineered Wood Products. At the same time, we continue to focus on operational improvements that reduce cost and improve revenue opportunities.", "Moving to WRECO. As Kathy noted, and as you can see on our web slides, volume, price and margin all increased during the quarter. Volume increased as a result of normal seasonality as well as continued recovery toward long-term trend levels. Our community count increased over 10% from the first quarter, leading to a strong increase in sales. We remain on pace to increase our net community count by 16% this year.", "June sales were unseasonably strong. This is the first time that June sales exceeded May sales since 2005, a signal of continued recovery in our markets. Second quarter sales activity was strongest for us in the California markets of L.A., Ventura and the Inland Empire, followed by Phoenix and Houston. Prices were up in all of our markets quarter-over-quarter.", "Last quarter, I expressed concerns about cost increases eroding margins of pre-sold homes. However, our experience in the second quarter is that prices are increasing faster than cost, allowing us to maintain and gradually grow margins.", "Even with the increasing level of closings during the quarter, our improved sales raised our backlog by over 25% over the prior quarter at almost 40% year-over-year. In 2012, we closed over 2,300 homes. At our analyst meeting in May, we forecast that 2013 closings would increase to 2,800. Today, we estimate that we'll close nearly 3,000 homes this year. We expect a large percentage of our backlog will be delivered in the fourth quarter, historically our most active quarter for home closings.", "My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers segment. Overall market conditions for pulp and liquid packaging were again relatively stable in the quarter. Our earnings improved significantly, primarily as a result of reduced maintenance expense and higher productivity. Pulp sales volumes were essentially flat, while volumes increased modestly for liquid packaging.", "When we talk about the strategy for our Cellulose Fibers segment, we focus on 3 elements. First, we strive for continuous improvement in our manufacturing through increased operating efficiency and reduced cost. Both of these contributed to our quarter-over-quarter improvement. Second, we need to continue to develop innovative products for new markets and improved margins. During the quarter, we added several new customers for our Pearl product, which will lead to future increases in sales volume. We also moved closer to commercialization of our THRIVE cellulose-based composite product. And third, we want to support our growing global customers. In June, we completed the qualification process and shipped our first commercial product from our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland.", "Now I'll briefly recap the major announcements that we made on a very busy Father's Day, June 16. First, we announced the acquisition of Longview Timber LLC, whose primary asset is 645,000 acres of unique, high-value Timberlands strategically located in Washington and Oregon. This acquisition expands our timber holdings in the Pacific Northwest by 1/3 to approximately 2.6 million acres. It also increases the total amount of timberlands that we own or control to nearly 7 million acres.", "The total purchase price, including the assumption of debt, was $2.65 billion. I'm pleased to report that this acquisition closed earlier this week, and Tom Gideon and his Timberlands team are now on the ground working with the Longview Timber team.", "This timberland enhances our leading position as the largest owner of timberland in the region. These lands are highly complementary and contiguous with our existing ownership in the area. We intend to leverage our silviculture, infrastructure, logistics and marketing expertise to reap the full potential of this valuable asset.", "Second, in conjunction with this acquisition, we announced that our board intends to raise our quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.22 per share. This increase should begin with our third quarter dividend, which will be declared in August and payable in September. This will be our third dividend increase in the last 4 quarters, bringing our total dividend increase to 47% over that time.", "Third, we announced that our board has authorized a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for WRECO. These alternatives could include continuing to hold and operate WRECO, or a merger, sale or spinoff of the business. Given the improving fundamentals of the housing market generally and of our own operations and the strategic growth markets, especially California, we want to explore strategic alternatives for the business to ensure that WRECO achieves its full potential. There can be no assurances that the board's evaluation process will result in any transaction or that any transaction it pursued will be consummated. However, we are fully engaged in the process, and we are encouraged by the interest that we've received. We do not intend to comment further unless or until the evaluation process is completed or terminated.", "Our final announcement on June 16 was to report that I will be stepping down as President and CEO of Weyerhaeuser on August 1. Doyle Simons, who is previously Chairman and CEO of Temple-Inland and has been a member of the Weyerhaeuser board since June 2012, has been appointed by the board as my successor.", "On August 1, I will become Executive Vice Chair, in which capacity I will serve until my planned retirement in October when I turn age 65. After August 1, I will provide support to Doyle as we complete the transition of responsibilities. It has been a privilege for me to have been able to serve as President and CEO of the company for the past 5-plus years, and I'm especially pleased to have Doyle follow me.", "Now before turning the call over to Patty, who will discuss our third quarter outlook, as well as provide a financial update, I'd like to give Doyle an opportunity to say a few words. Doyle?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Good morning, everybody, and thank you, Dan. I am truly excited to take over as President and CEO on August 1, and Dan will be a very tough act to follow. As Kathy mentioned, the focus of today's call will be our second quarter earnings. I look forward to speaking with each of you on the third quarter call and beyond.", "With that, let me turn it over to Patty to discuss our third quarter outlook.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for the third quarter is summarized on Chart 13. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands.", "In the West, export price realizations and volumes are expected to be lower for the quarter. The Japan market is normally seasonally softer during the summer months due to rainy weather, and Japan continues to experience carpenter and construction labor shortages as a result of a strong housing market. In addition, China has entered its typical July slowdown.", "Domestic log markets in the West are anticipated to be weaker during the third quarter due to lower saw mill production in the West as a result of pressure on lumber pricing. In addition, we typically see more logs coming to market in the summer from the small, private, non-industrial land owners who don't have adequate road systems to harvest on a year-round basis. As a result, we traditionally plan a lower fee harvest volume in the West for the third quarter. We also accelerated some harvests into the first half of this year to take advantage of the strong export market. While we do anticipate a slower third quarter, we expect activity will again pick up later in the year.", "In the third quarter, we will also see increased road costs in the West as we expect more seasonal road maintenance and spur roadbuilding as is typical this time of year. In the South, overall price realizations are anticipated to be comparable to the second quarter. Although fee harvest volumes should be higher due to seasonally better weather, this increased volume will carry a heavier mix due to first settings [ph]. We're also planning higher cost from seasonally increased silviculture treatments, which again is typical of the quarter. We expect that earnings from non-strategic landfills will be somewhat higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.", "As Dan mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of 645,000 acres of high-value timberlands in the West just a couple of days ago. We're very excited about the opportunity that these lands provide going forward. However, the third quarter results will only include about 2 months of activity. The positive effect of these incremental earnings will be more than offset by the seasonal slowdown in our existing operations and therefore, we expect that overall earnings in our Timberlands segment will be lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.", "In Wood Products, as Kathy discussed, prices for both lumber and OSB declined throughout the second quarter, such that we began this quarter at significantly lower levels than the average of the second quarter. Current prices for lumber and OSB are improving. However, we expect third quarter average realizations for OSB will be down substantially compared to the second quarter, and average realizations for lumber will also be lower.", "Engineered Wood Product sales realizations are expected to improve modestly. Sales volumes for OSB and engineered wood are expected to increase, while volumes for lumber should be comparable to the second quarter.", "Log prices in the West should be lower in the third quarter, comparable to the second quarter for the South and slightly higher in Canada. OSB and engineered wood manufacturing costs should improve given higher production, and we expect lower OSB web cost for I-Joist.", "The improvement in manufacturing cost will not be enough to offset this quarter's lower average sales realization in OSB and lumber and, as a result, we expect that earnings in our Wood Products segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second. However, given the recent improvement in prices, a strengthening housing market and our continued focus on operational improvement, we expect that earnings will be well above the third quarter of last year.", "In Cellulose Fibers, we expect modest improvement and average sales realizations and volumes for pulp and liquid packaging board. The effect of these increases will be offset by higher maintenance costs associated with increased planned annual outage days in the third quarter compared to the second, as well as the impact of the lost productivity associated with the maintenance downtime. We expect that third quarter earnings in our Cellulose Fiber segment will be comparable to the second quarter.", "In Real Estate, we expect continued improvement in our single-family homebuilding business as a result of a strengthening housing recovery, especially in Southern California, as well as the seasonally stronger third quarter compared to the second quarter. Sales have continued at a brisk pace, and we expect to close over 700 homes in the third quarter compared to the 636 closed in the second quarter. Average closing prices are anticipated to be comparable to the second quarter at about $400,000 per closing.", "Price increases have been implemented in most of our communities, which will result in margin expansion for future closings. We expect margins of approximately 20% in the third quarter, which is slightly lower than the second quarter due to mix. Volume costs will be higher as a result of the increased closing volume. We anticipate a slight increase in our earnings from land sales compared to the 2 million in the second quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in our Real Estate segment will be higher in the third quarter compared to the second.", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. I'll refer you to Chart 14 for this discussion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of just over $900 million. This does not include the cash rate in our June equity offering of approximately $1,450,000,000. These funds are segregated on our balance sheet as they were designated for the acquisition of the Longview Timber lands. Excluding these funds, cash increased approximately $270 million compared to the end of the first quarter. Cash from operations increased from a negative $61 million in the first quarter to $374 million in the second quarter.", "Year-to-date, for the first half of the year, we had capital expenditures, including reforestation, of approximately $100 million. We still expect to spend up to $300 million for the full year, so the activity will pick up in the second half of the year. Excluding the Longview acquisition, we have debt maturities for the remainder of the year of just over $230 million, of which, just over $160 million is due in the third quarter.", "With the closing of the Longview acquisition earlier this week, we assume debt of just under $1.1 billion. We expect that we will repay this debt in the fourth quarter and replace it with unsecured longer-dated maturity debt. We expect that this will be a combination of bank and public market debt, the mix and timing of which is still to be finalized.", "Finally, Chart 15 summarizes the changes in our share count as a result of the equity offerings we initiated in June for the acquisition.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Patty. As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, we had a very busy quarter at Weyerhaeuser. We had solid financial results with all 4 of our businesses contributing to increased profitability. From a strategic perspective, we're excited about our acquisition of the 645,000-acre Longview Timber asset. This acquisition is consistent with our stated intent to play to our strength and grow our timberlands base, taking full advantage of our Timber REIT structure.", "And finally, the strategic review of our WRECO business evidences our commitment to ensure that WRECO achieves its full potential for the benefit of our shareholders.", "And now we welcome your questions and comments.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Dan, best of luck. I guess you talked about -- and WRECO is seeing strength in June business this year than in May. I'm wondering if you can give a little bit perspective on July with interest rates rising? Have you seen any sort of changes in consumer behavior in WRECO?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We have not seen any significant changes in behavior, Gail. The thing that was noteworthy about June was as we look at the pattern of sales, it was noteworthy because normally, we see some summer slowdown. But in fact, June being stronger than May, it was the first time that's happened since 2005. And so to me, that is evidence that we are on a path of this longer-term recovery. So you think about where housing starts are today as compared to long-term trend levels, we've got a long way to go. And so we should expect to see steady improvement, and so we're breaking some of these seasonal patterns, and that's a good thing.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one other quick question. Patty, can -- the Wood Product guidance for the third quarter, are you assuming that the current -- the recent price improvement in OSB and lumber continues? Or is it kind of based on current levels of pricing?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes, it is that it will continue to improve for all the reasons that we talked about in terms of the underlying fundamentals, but it will still be well below what the average was for the second quarter. But as I said, we do expect that while it will be less than what we earned in the second quarter, it will still be well above the third quarter of last year. So I think that will give you a little bit in terms of the guideposts of what we're looking at out of the Wood Products segment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So your pulp business is doing fine. What I was wondering is if you could tell us how well you think the market has absorbed the new capacity that other people have been bringing on? You haven't seen quite the impact that some others have, but I'm just curious if you think competitive pressure there is still significant. And then the second more specific question, with respect to logs in the South, I'm curious how much the wet weather has actually affected your production. Obviously, we're all talking about demand, but I'm curious whether we're going to see a production impact from all the rain that we've had.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Mark. Well, with respect to the pulp market, as Patty commented, thinking about the third quarter guidance, we are seeing relative stabilization. There has been some change in supply, some going out of the market with Rayonier completing their shift in their mill. Fundamentally, we rely on the relationships with our longer-term customers, and so we feel relatively confident about demand levels going forward. We would certainly benefit from a pickup in global growth because there's been some softness. But at this point, I think the reliance that we have on our longer-term relationships with large global customers has served us well.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I think the other thing as we think about our Cellulose Fibers business relative to other commodities plus producers is that we do have a number of specialty products within that particular space. I think Dan referenced the Pearl product and certainly, our cross-linked product that is -- commands a higher price, also probably underpins the fact that you haven't seen as much pressure on ours as probably some of our competitors.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "And then you had a question about logs in the South, Mark?", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I'm just curious whether the weather that we've been seeing mostly in the Southeast has had much impact and is going to have much impact on you down there?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We do not expect a significant impact in the third quarter.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I think that as we look at our Timberlands business, we do expect that we will harvest more fee volume in the third quarter, as I said, which is typical. We did -- probably one place where we'll see some additional impact is from -- earlier in the second quarter, we would have likely done a little more silvicultural treatment traditionally. But because of the wet weather, some of that did get deferred into the third quarter. So it's really more from a copy [ph] perspective that you'll see some impact for our particular operation.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Another element, Mark, is -- one other element, Mark, is that we have -- generally, a road system that's in better shape than perhaps some of the smaller owners.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Congratulations to Dan and Doyle. I wanted to ask a kind of an arcane question. You mentioned that we don't see an improvement in the, I guess, EBIT of the Timberlands segment, and I was wondering if one reason could be accounting for the write-up of inventory of logs that you obviously have to do when you make an acquisition? And if -- and as you work down those inventories, if they've been written up, that could help raise earnings in future periods?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Chip, there really isn't a big impact from the write-up of log inventory in that we don't carry big log inventories in the Timberland business in the West. So if you're thinking about large log decks that typically you would see in the West, those might be in competitors' saw mills but certainly not in the Timberland business. So we really won't have a big inventory as we make the acquisition. And Longview typically didn't carry big long inventories as well. So we really look at the activity in the third quarter from Longview, being the fact that we will really only have that for about 2 months. And then also, they have the same impact in terms of pricing for the third quarter that I talked about in the export market, certainly that we are looking at as well. So we do believe that as we go into the fourth quarter, we expect that pricing will be picking up and that we will then also have had the 2 additional months on the ground to really start to work on some of the logistics and marketing synergies that we talked about during the call on the announcement of the acquisition.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you. And then just a quick follow-up. As we go from the third to the fourth quarter, how will the maintenance expense in the Cellulose segment change? More specifically, the impact of not taking this much down time if we leave price neutral?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, we're really only talking about guidance for the third quarter on this particular call, Chip. So in terms of giving fourth quarter guidance, we'll probably defer to the fourth quarter. But most of our maintenance did happen to a great extent earlier in the year. So I would expect that it will be somewhat lighter, but I don't have specific guidance for you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Dan, best wishes for your retirement, and we appreciated the interactions that we've had over the last couple of years with you. Thank you for that. A couple of quick questions for you. First, it seems like you guys saw a pretty good pricing momentum on the EWP side. Can you just talk about how you see your utilization rates in that business and opportunities perhaps for a little more prices as you move through the balance of 2013?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Alex. As we've talked here about Engineered Wood Products, it is the product line in Wood Products that is most closely tied to new home construction. Utilization rates have been relatively low in this business during the recession, and we've been talking about the fact that we would expect it to start to pick up with housing recovery. And so we've seen, I would say, early stages of that. And as construction starts, continue to pick up, that will affect that business pretty significantly because the products that are produced are going into new home construction. As we've talked about, our own experience in WRECO with the increase in sales, and we look at broad housing start numbers, we are starting to see the momentum of this recovery, and it should translate into increased sales activity for the engineered products and with the facilities that we've got. That will be evidenced in our higher utilization rates. So that's what we've been expecting to happen, and so we're starting to see early evidence of that.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And just a question on sawlog prices in the U.S. South. We continue to flat line even though we're -- you're 2 of a housing recovery. Do you think there's much visibility there in terms of just where the inventory levels actually are and how long do we take to be able to work through the deferred harvest levels in the U.S. South and actually see some sort of uptick in sawlog prices in the South?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We've discussed in the past the fact that there were more deferrals in the South than in the West because of the fact that the West has export potential. Additionally, there are more small land owners in the South. And what we are seeing is as housing begins to pick up, there is an increase in volume, but there's not that significant cost pressure that there is in the West. So it will happen eventually, but I can't call the timing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Best wishes, Dan. I just had 2 areas I wanted to ask about. First, Patty, can you give us just any guidance going forward from kind of harvest volumes and mix at Longview, both in the third quarter and then on an annual basis thereafter?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I really don't have numbers to give you on that, Mark, but I would tell you that we will be looking at accelerating some harvest over what historically Longview has done. So maybe pointing you towards the filings that we made of the Longview financial statements in the first quarter of this year. So you can see 2013 first quarter and then 2012 as well. So we'll be accelerating that harvest because of the maturity of the forest, as well as, as we enter again into the fourth quarter, we'll see export activity beginning to pick up; as well as, as we look at lumber pricing continuing to improve domestically in the West, we expect that we'll be seeing a pickup in domestic log activity as well.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. The other thing I wanted to ask about is just the distribution business. I really appreciate the fact that you've segregated that out now. You had a $13 million EBITDA loss in the second quarter. We know that there were inventory issues with the falling prices. I'm just curious about how you would think of -- have us think about that business on a going-forward basis and also if there's sort of a level of housing starts that you think will get you to EBITDA breakeven in that business, and maybe even what like 1.5 million starts might mean for profitability in the business.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Thanks, Mark. In the second quarter, the operating losses that we had in our distribution business were, in large part, related to the significant drop that was experienced in prices for the commodity OSB and lumber. Some of that is a function of the level of inventory that we're carrying. Some of that is the function of the challenges in that business with that kind of a price decline. Longer term, I can't put a number on housing starts as to what level it will take in order to return that business to profitability. I can tell you that our focus is on improving operations today as it has been with our other Wood Products businesses in order to be profitable at the level of starts that are available to us in today's market, rather than projecting it in the future. So as is the case with our other Wood Products businesses, we had a significant number of initiatives underway to improve operations. I'm confident that we will see some progress, but obviously, we're disappointed with what happened in the second quarter. And we believe that as the market picks up, we will certainly benefit from the leverage of the business, but we also need to make operating improvements.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Congratulations to Dan and Doyle. Just following up on Wood Products, I was wondering if you could share your operating rates for the 3 businesses. And during the quarter, we obviously saw a decline in lumber and OSB prices, and there were discussions of some mills out West taking downtime. And I'm wondering if that lumber price weakness caused you to step back from adding shifts or any flex capacity? Or if you could share with us what you saw in the quarter?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "In the second quarter, Anthony, our operating rate for lumber was elevated slightly, so we operated at about a 93% operating rate. And OSB operating rates were flat to the second quarter at about 88%. And then our I-Joist business, we were roughly 45%, and then sawlog's a bit north of 55%, which is consistent with where we were in the prior quarter. In terms of our production rates, we do adjust based upon market demand. We have -- in each of our markets, we focus on operating the right shifts at the right time with the right capacity and will continue to adjust to market conditions. And [indiscernible]. As we -- go ahead, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe switching to the log side, and for 3Q in the West, you referenced potentially weaker export prices. And I'm wondering, as you went from maybe the end of the quarter into July, if you have any -- if you could share any kind of view on log prices to Japan and China? And in your comments, you -- when you discussed sort of weakness in China, you seemed to reference it as being pretty seasonal or sort of typical seasonal weakness. And I was just wondering if you could give us a view on the Chinese market as well.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure, Anthony. It's Patty. As we think about the China market, it, as well as Japan, was strong in the first half of the year. And as I've said, typically, in China, when you get into the July time frame, very hot. The workers really go back to more of the rural areas, and so we always see somewhat of a seasonal slowdown in China. And that really is our view on China as we go through the third quarter, which will be softer. But we expect it will pick up again in the fourth quarter. So that really is seasonal from our perspective. And your other question was?", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just in terms of price movement from June to July. Are you seeing a meaningful deterioration of export prices out West? Or are they basically stable? What are you seeing?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "It's a little softer as we talked about on the guidance. It's not a huge drop. Prices are still good. It's just that, relative to the second quarter, they will not be as strong.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Anthony, just to add a little bit of color, we had actually very strong sales in the second quarter to China. They picked up quite a bit from the first quarter. China is primarily a buyer of whitewood rather than Douglas fir. As you know, our -- Weyerhaeuser lands are very heavy to Douglas fir, the -- as are the Longview Timber lands. But the Longview Timber lands have a little bit higher percentage of white wood, and we'll be able to take advantage of that in providing some additional supply to the China market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Congrats again to both Dan and Doyle. My question, my first one, is on WRECO. You mentioned that sales levels have been brisk. June was an outlier relative to May versus the last 7 years. You mentioned that pricing seems to be outpacing cost, if I heard you correctly. And from the homebuilders as well, you've been seeing generally strong outlooks into the third calendar quarter. And so while I realize that you're seeing a modest improvement in WRECO profits thus far into the third quarter in your guidance relative to 2Q, I'm wondering why we aren't seeing a little bit more lift now, Dan, in terms of homebuilding profits. In the past, you've talked about mix. What factors are limiting factors now, if any? And when do you hope to surmount those? Thanks, and I had a follow-on.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "Let me talk about the increase in sales activity throughout the first and second quarter and the impact on our backlog. So at this point, when we talk about backlog, George, you're aware that backlog includes -- so it's sales of homes that have not been closed yet, and they may be homes that are completed or under construction or still to be built. We have very, very low levels of standing inventory and so for most part, our backlog has a longer-term delivery cycle, which would shift more of those closings and backlog to the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. So you see what we've done so far in the first 2 quarters, Patty talked about the deliveries that we expect in the third quarter. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we've now increased our expectations for closings for the entire year. So we expect having a very strong fourth quarter, likely a higher percentage of fourth quarter closings than we have seen in quite a number of years. Even though fourth quarter is generally stronger, this fourth quarter, I think, will be stronger than most. There is a mixed shift that takes place quarter-to-quarter, and it is impacted by where those houses are. And so we had a higher percentage in the second quarter in San Diego, including some homes that we thought we'd close in the third quarter that actually closed at the very end of the second quarter. And at the same time, we had a shift of some homes that we thought would close in the second quarter that moved into the first couple of weeks of the third quarter. So that mixed shift does matter. The most significant factor in what you highlighted is that in our remarks, we said that we are starting to see some margin improvement as we're able to pass through price increases. So on a same-store basis, we are seeing margin improvement. But in some quarters, that's clouded by mix. So our view is that over the longer term, we should expect to see those higher margins show up in the closings that we would see coming in the fourth quarter and perhaps even into the first quarter of next year.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I understand. And Dan, the relative question I had, in the last few quarters, you've talked about mix being dampened by, I think, some level of more affordable housing being built into your communities. Will that factor be lessened to any great degree over the next few quarters? Or is that always going to be something you have to contend with? Should we see a better margin from here on out as that mix factor lessens hopefully?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "So what you're referring to is the issue of margins on affordable homes that we are required to build in some master-planned communities as part of the overall master plan entitlement. It has affected us most significantly in the Maryland, Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. where we build affordable townhomes as part of larger master plans. That will still be a factor, and it's a factor because when we deliver those affordable homes, we generally do it with a block of homes at one time. And so there's a larger percentage perhaps in any given quarter. But as our volume picks up generally, that would be a smaller and smaller percentage of our overall closings. And so we should expect that the impact of that will be diminished as we go forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "I guess, like Mark Wilde, I was trying to get some help modeling Longview, and I'll try a different approach. If we look at the purchase price and assumed, say, a 6% discount rate, that would imply annual sales of $160 million. Would that be a good way to add to your legacy land base and then maybe give a little extra bump for the synergies and increased harvesting that you planned?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, I think the way to think about it, Steve, is really to look at what Longview has been harvesting. And I think that's around 475,000 to 500,000 board feet. And I think also, to think about your outlook for pricing in terms of how you think about what pricing will do on a go-forward basis, considering that there is a rich mix in terms of mature logs, but also logs that can go into the Japan market and that as we look at what will happen with their cost structure, we do believe that the synergies that we talked about, of about $20 million, we will get certainly over time but will get a significant portion of that even yet this year in terms of on a run rate perspective and that we will also access the marketing expertise that we have as well. On the flip side, as you think about the historical amounts for Longview, we will take out the purchase price, most of which will be Timberland, and we will pool that with our Western lands in terms of a single rate for depletion. I think I would refer you to the pro-formas that were in the prospectus that we filed for the equity offering, and you can see how that will roll through the financial statement. For the third quarter, that cooling didn't have a significant impact on the results, but it could in the future as we go forward, given the mix of what we would harvest from Longview and what we would harvest from our existing Western lands.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "And I -- just as a follow-on, having done such a large transaction, should we consider you to be still in the market? We know you want to grow your land base. Or are you out of the market for Timberlands for a little while?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We're always in the market trying to improve, what I would call improve our hand in our land position. A lot of that activity happens on a quarter-over-quarter basis with $10.31 exchanges, where we can improve the return on -- to hold on all of the lands that we have, and the way we do that is we have to maintain an active position in the market. So we're exposed to opportunities that emerge. We'll take a look at them. And as we talked when we announced the Longview acquisition, we've looked at a lot of property over the last several years, and this was really one that had an extraordinary fit to us for a lot of reasons. So we'll be cautious. But for the right property, we will be certainly taking a look. But we've got a lot to absorb with the Longview acquisition, and our focus right now is to integrate that into our operations and to capture all of the opportunities that it brings us.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Two quick ones. One, on the pulp business, you had some initiatives underway with the intent of reducing maintenance costs sourced -- spreading that out over 18 months instead of 12 months. Can you give us an update on how that's proceeding and whether that will have any impact on 2014?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We've made a lot of progress in shifting to an 18-month scheduled maintenance schedule, Mark. We've talked about this over the last couple of years. It takes some time to implement this on a mill-by-mill basis because, in some cases, we have had to invest in some operating equipment to allow us to do that. In other cases -- in every case, we have to have an approval from a regulatory body at the state or, if it's not state-controlled, even our own insurance carrier. So we've been working through that process. And additionally, all of our mills, with the exception of Grande Prairie, have received an approval to go to an 18-month outage schedule. Grand Prairie is still being evaluated. And in some cases, where we receive an approval, it'll be subject to further review after that first 18-month cycle to be sure that we are operating safely. Our focus is to be sure that we're doing it safely. But we've made great progress, and you should expect to see some of the benefits begin to play out in 2014. But really, 2015 probably will be the most significant impact.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And I believe at one point you had said about $40 million would be a potential benefit from that. Is that still a good number?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I don't remember what the exact number was that we had before, Mark. But there's no reason that we would see a change from what the number was that we had before, but I don't have the prior ones in front of me. I think just as we think about the mills, we have underway now with us -- we are completing the annual outages for some of the mills in 2013. They are on their 18-month outage. So you don't see it in '13 because their outage did take place. But their next outage will be 18 months from now. So some will not have an outage in '14. We do have 1 mill that didn't have -- won't have an outage in '13. So what we're trying to do is stagger those because it is a function of not only the maintenance between, timing between, but also the staging of customer orders as well. So it is underway as we speak. And as Dan said, we would expect, with the exception of Grande Prairie, which is still -- we're looking at it. We expect to try to move that one as well. But we would expect all of them during 2014 to be on an 18-month schedule. That doesn't necessarily mean they won't all have an outage in '14, though, but they will be on a staggered basis.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay, great. And then if I'm doing my math right, it seems like you're hoping, anticipating to have north of 1,000 closings in WRECO in the fourth quarter, and I'm trying to get a sense as to what type of gross margin you think is embedded in the backlog. I understand that in the third quarter, there's some mix, which is going to bring the gross margin down a little bit perhaps from the third quarter level. I think in the past, you've talked about low 20 gross margins. Are we at a point where you're able to achieve those types of gross margins on the backlog that you see? Or do we have to get to higher run rates for that?", "Daniel S. Fulton", "We have identified low 20% gross margins as a long-term number that you should be able to count on. And over a couple of quarters, we've had some mix issues. I don't want to provide guidance for fourth quarter margins at this point. You are correct. As you look at the estimated number of closings and -- I would fall back to my comments that we've been through a period where we had cost increases that were keeping pace with price increases. And in the second quarter, our price increases outpaced cost increases, and so we are encouraged about the longer-term direction of our margins. And as we look at the homes that are in that backlog, we would expect some continuing strength and pickup in margins, but we can't provide at this point a fourth quarter guidance number.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Okay. That concludes our call. I'll turn it back to Dan.", "Daniel S. Fulton", "So just some brief closing comments from me. First of all, as always, we appreciate your attendance today and your interest in Weyerhaeuser Company. I want to thank all of you on the call for your support during my tenure as the Weyerhaeuser CEO. The past 5 years have tested us, but through the hard work and dedication of Weyerhaeuser employees, we've adjusted to changing market conditions, and I believe that we're well positioned to continue to improve our performance in order to maximize the value of all of our assets. As I wrap up my final earnings call with you, I look forward to the experience and the energy and the commitment that Doyle brings to his new role. And then I'd like to add one final comment, and that is that throughout my entire tenure as CEO and the many times that we've been together with you in our analyst and investor meetings, and on the many calls that we've had for quarterly earnings and other special events, I've been joined throughout that process by Patty Bedient and Kathy McAuley. I just want to say that I've been incredibly blessed to have had their support along our path together, and I want to thank them in front of all of you. And I want to direct anybody that has further questions to follow up with Kathy. But we appreciate you joining the call, and I am really looking forward to the next phase of company performance and what Doyle will bring to it. So thanks very much, everybody, this morning.

Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Please review the statements -- the warning statements on our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.

I will now turn the call over to Doyle. Doyle?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today. It's been a busy almost 3 months since I joined Weyerhaeuser, and as I've said before, I'm excited to be here.", "This morning, I am pleased to report solid third quarter earnings of $157 million or $0.27 per diluted share on net sales of $2.2 billion. This is a 34% increase in earnings compared with third quarter 2012 and a 28% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared with year-ago levels.", "Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, Charts 2 to 4. Timberlands contributed $118 million to earnings in the quarter, up $4 million from second quarter 2013 as the contribution from a partial quarter from the Longview Timberland acquisition mostly offset a smaller-than-expected seasonal decline in earnings from the company's legacy Western operations. In addition, non-strategic Timberlands dispositions were up modestly in the quarter.", "In the West, log sale realizations were down in both domestic and export markets. Fee harvest from legacy Western lands was seasonally lower and as expected, road and silviculture expenses increased in the quarter.", "In the South, log sale realizations in the third quarter were flat compared to the second quarter and fee harvest volumes were up modestly.", "We continue to be excited about our acquisition of the Longview Timberland and are fully engaged in leveraging our silviculture, logistics and marketing expertise to realize the full potential of this outstanding asset. This transaction closed on July 23 and contributed $16 million in earnings and $26 million in EBITDA in the quarter. Going forward, we will be focused on maximizing the earnings and cash flow from all our Timberlands.", "Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $79 million to earnings in the quarter, down from $136 million in the second quarter, but above the $59 million of earnings from third quarter 2012. Average sales realizations for OSB declined 26% in third quarter 2013 compared with second quarter 2013, and realizations for lumber fell by approximately 7%. The effect of these lower prices was somewhat offset by higher sales volumes across all product lines and lower log cost in the West.", "Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $110 million. In lumber, EBITDA was down $26 million in the third quarter compared with the second, as lower prices were partially offset by higher volumes and lower log cost, especially in the West.", "In our lumber operations, we are focused on continuing to drive down our cost structure and improve our margins.", "In OSB, EBITDA was down by approximately $42 million in the quarter compared to second quarter as significantly lower prices were partially offset by higher volumes and lower fiber costs. We continue to be focused on lowering manufacturing cost and delivering high margin products to our growing customer base in this business.", "Engineered Wood Products generated EBITDA of $16 million in the quarter compared with $7 million in the second quarter of 2013. This improvement was due to higher prices in volumes and lower costs. We are committed to continuing to improve the operating performance of this business.", "The Distribution business remained challenged in the quarter as it worked through higher-priced commodity inventory. We expect improved results from this business in the fourth quarter due to our performance improvement initiatives.", "Cellulose Fibers, Charts 7 and 8. Cellulose Fibers contributed $47 million in the quarter, down from second quarter 2013 as higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the scheduled shutdown of a liquid packaging board facility, higher fiber costs associated with wet weather in the South and higher chemical costs in the quarter more than offset slightly higher pulp realizations due to mix. We are focused on 3 priorities in this business: first, we will continue to drive down our cost through operational excellence; second, we will focus on developing new specialty products to improve our margins; and finally, we will continue to support our growing global customer base. Our ramp up of our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland is going well.", "Real Estate, Charts 9 to 11. WRECO reported solid results as Real Estate contributed $33 million of earnings in the quarter, more than double the contribution during the second quarter. Single-family closings increased seasonally by nearly 21% over the second quarter, and margins improved to 22.3% as margins increased due to previously implemented price increases.", "As Patty will share with you in more detail in just a moment, we expect a very strong quarter in this fourth -- we expect a very strong fourth quarter in this business with closing volume increasing nearly 50% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter.", "In a moment, I will come back with some general comments on markets, but let me now turn it over to Patty to specifically address our fourth quarter outlook.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for our fourth quarter earnings is summarized on Chart 13, and I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. In the West, export realizations are expected to be comparable to the third quarter on higher sales volume, primarily as a result of including a full quarter's operation of the Longview acquisition. Domestic realizations are expected to increase slightly. Lower sales volumes from our legacy Western ownership will be offset by increases from the Longview acquisition. Fee harvest in the West is expected to increase by about 10%, and Longview accounts for most of this increase. Costs are anticipated to be lower in the West due to decreased silviculture spending. In the South, realizations are expected to be slightly lower due to mix. Fee harvest is expected to increase on a seasonal basis. Logging costs are anticipated to increase due to a slightly longer hauling distance this quarter. Silviculture costs will also increase due to the timing of treatment. Sales of non-strategic Timberlands are anticipated to be modestly lower. Overall earnings in the Timberlands segment are expected to be comparable to the results in the third quarter.", "In Wood Products, the fourth quarter is traditionally one of the weakest earnings quarters of the year as we close out the building season and mills prepare to perform minor maintenance and capital projects during the slower holiday season. As a result, we expect to see lower sales volumes across most product lines and flat to potentially softening prices as we progress through the quarter. We continue to focus on controlling inventories and matching supply with demand while driving further operational improvement. We anticipate that log costs will increase in both lumber and oriented strand board. Earnings in the Wood Products segment are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, but still above the $38 million we earned in the fourth quarter of last year.", "In Cellulose Fibers, pulp realizations are continuing to move up, and shipment volumes are also expected to increase modestly. Worldwide inventories of softwood pulp are well-balanced and exchange rates are favorable. Maintenance expense should be lower as we have fewer days planned for maintenance outages. We anticipate higher productivity and decreased chemical costs during the quarter. We expect that earnings in the Cellulose Fiber segment will increase significantly during the fourth quarter compared to the third.", "In Real Estate, we opened 8 new communities in the third quarter, and we expect to end the year with a community count in the mid-80s, which compares to 62 communities at the end of last year. At the end of the third quarter of this year, our backlog of homes sold but not closed was 1,435, an increase of 36% compared to a year ago. Although we have seen some weakness in consumer confidence, driven by the current uncertainty of governmental actions, we continue to believe that we will see improved results as housing recovers. During the fourth quarter, we expect to close over 1,100 homes or approximately 35% higher than the fourth quarter a year ago. The average price per closing is projected to be higher than the third quarter, with gross margins between 21% to 22%. Selling costs will increase as a result of the additional closings. We also expect earnings from land and lot sales to be comparable to the third quarter. Overall, fourth quarter earnings in our Real Estate segment is expected to increase significantly compared to the third quarter.", "I'd like to touch on unallocated items, and unallocated items are shown on Chart 12. During the third quarter, we had a very large positive adjustment for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. This is the result of reductions in inventory, primarily in Wood Products. We do not expect the fourth quarter adjustment to be of the same magnitude.", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. I'll be referencing numbers on Chart 14 for these comments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $900 million, comparable to the second quarter, excluding cash associated with the financing of the Longview Timberland acquisition. In July, we purchased the equity of Longview Timber for $1.58 billion in cash and assumed debt of approximately $1.1 billion. During September, we issued $500 million of new debt, and earlier this month, we borrowed an additional $550 million under a term loan, which, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition. As a result of the early repayment of the assumed debt, we will have a charge for early extinguishment of approximately $24 million in the fourth quarter. Debt repayments for the third quarter, exclusive of the acquisition, totaled $163 million. Fourth quarter maturities are approximately $69 million. After the fourth quarter, we have minimal maturities until 2017.", "In addition, during the third quarter, we replaced our existing revolving credit agreement with a new $1 billion agreement that does not expire until 2018. There are no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. Capital expenditures, including reforestation for the third quarter were $76 million, bringing our year-to-date expenditures to $179 million. We still anticipate spending for the full year to approximate $300 million.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.", "Doyle R. Simons", "Thank you, Patty. In terms of markets, and specifically housing markets, we continue to be encouraged as long term favorable housing fundamentals remain in place. With that said, the housing recovery appears to have taken a slight pause due to higher home prices, higher interest rates, although still very low by historical standards, slowing job growth and the antics of our government. However, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a longer-term return to trend levels of housing starts.", "Forecasters now [Audio Gap] that there will be approximately 950,000 U.S. housing starts in 2013 and somewhere between 1.1 million and 1.2 million starts in 2014. The housing starts long-term average is north of 1.5 million units. So there's still a lot of runway in front of us. We are focused on driving ROI and cash flow to capitalize on the upturn, as well as appropriately positioning our sales for the future.", "On that note, we will host an investor meeting in New York on December 17. In that meeting, we will address where Weyerhaeuser is today, where we are going and what we are doing to make this a truly great company for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing our thoughts and plans with you at that time. Later this morning, we will put out a notice containing the details of the meeting.", "Finally, regarding our previously announced process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for WRECO, we are fully engaged in the process, continue to be encouraged by the interest in this business and will be back to you when the process is completed. Until then, as I'm sure you will understand and appreciate, we will not have any further comment on the strategic review.", "With that, we will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Doyle, a couple of bigger-picture questions maybe to start. You mentioned driving cash flow and ROI within Weyerhaeuser in the years ahead. Are these going to be the primary metrics that you focus your team on, or are there any other metrics that we should be aware, that you can discuss at this juncture, that you'll be using to gauge the progress of the company? And then you mentioned a couple of times, certainly within Wood Products, and I think also within Cell Fibers, that you are focused on lowering manufacturing costs to paraphrase at this juncture to the point -- to the extent that you can comment where do you see the opportunities to do that?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Good morning, George, and thanks for the question. I would say in terms of your first question, clearly, ROI and cash flow will be key metrics for our company going forward. But I wouldn't say they'll be the sole metric, but clearly, those will be key metrics for our company going forward. We look forward to our conversation on December 17, at which time we will provide hopefully a lot more clarity on, again, where we are, where we're going, how we're going to get there and how we will measure our progress along the way. In terms of Wood Products, one of the things we are focused on throughout the company will be to continue to drive down our cost and specifically, our manufacturing cost. What we're looking forward to doing is delivering high-quality products to our customers, products that our customers want and are willing to pay for and doing that at the lowest possible cost. So that will clearly continue to be a focus for Weyerhaeuser going forward.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Doyle, maybe the follow on and I'll turn it over, do you see the opportunity more driven by process or by needing to maybe put in more investment or some other factors as well? And then just quickly, and I'll turn it over, should we expect that your overall operating profit in WRECO in 4Q is up versus last year's level?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes. I'll address the first question, and then I'll ask Patty to address your second question, George. But in terms of opportunity, I think it's all the things you listed. I mean, it will be process, it'll be -- we'll look at opportunities to drive down cost across-the-board. Again, what we're focused on is producing high-quality new products for our customers and doing that at the lowest possible cost. So we'll be looking for opportunities to do that. Some of those opportunities will require some capital. Some of those will not. With that, let me ask Patty to address your second question.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "So George, your second question, I think, was profit in WRECO this quarter compared to a year ago, fourth quarter compared to a year ago?", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Correct.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes, I think that the thing that swings from quarter-to-quarter is that -- and I don't remember fourth quarter a year ago, how much we had in terms of land sales and lot sales in the fourth quarter. Our single-family home-building business will be very strong in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 2012. And I think -- as I've mentioned in the comments that at this point, we would expect a comparable amount of land and lot sales, although as you know, they're quite lumpy but comparable to the third quarter, which I think was about $9 million.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess, just starting on the longer-term -- the near-term outlook for housing, when you talk about consensus numbers of 1.1 million to 1.2 million next year, from kind of what you're seeing from the market and hearing from your customers, how much confidence do you have that consensus has it right?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes, as you know, predicting housing numbers is always a little difficult, Gail. I would tell you that when you step back and look at the long-term fundamentals, I continue -- we continue to be very bullish on housing. As I mentioned, there has been a slight pause here due to a lot of factors, but clearly, in my mind, we have and we'll continue to have an upward trend in housing as we start to approach the 1.5 million to 1.6 million average over the next few years. And I don't know exactly what the slope of that line is going to be. I think it has flattened a little bit just because of the issues that I raised. But we'll see how it plays out, but I think, in my opinion, the 1.2 -- 1.1 million to 1.2 million is a pretty good guess at this point in time.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, and I mean, the pause that you're seeing, I mean, how significant was it? I mean, it looks like WRECO buyer traffic was down pretty significantly. Was that seasonal or was that reflective of the uncertainty that we saw rise with interest rates coming up in DC?", "Doyle R. Simons", "I think it was a combination of both, Gail. I think clearly, again, as we had the shut down from the government, as we had prices go up in houses and some other factors, we saw a pause. But again, I think pause is the right term. I don't want to overstate the pause. And again, if you look at the underlying fundamentals, they continue to be strong and in place and I think will drive housing going forward.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just a quick question on Engineered Wood. Given what's been going on in terms of the input costs, do you see the recovery as sustainable, or at some point, would you expect to see some price pressure emerge as customers kind of start pressuring you given some of the cost relief of lumber and OSB pricing?", "Doyle R. Simons", "I think in that business, as we mentioned, we saw a nice improvement in the quarter, Gail. Now there will still be seasonal factors that will have an impact. And as Patty outlined, fourth quarter is a slow seasonal quarter. But longer-term, that's a business that we're encouraged by what we're seeing on the pricing front, probably need additional pricing going forward. But more importantly, we're focused on our operations and making sure that we provide, on a cost-effective basis, the products that our customers need.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citibank.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "In Wood Products, you talked about your expectation for improved distribution performance in 4Q, and I was wondering if you could give us any color on the performance improvement initiatives that are driving that improvement. And then maybe what is the magnitude of earnings improvement you're expecting versus the loss this quarter, and how much of that is really driven by the performance initiatives versus just sort of working through inventory?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes, good question, Anthony. And the improvement that we anticipate in the fourth quarter, as you just highlighted, will be driven primarily by 2 factors. One is the fact that we will have worked through most of the high-priced inventory in the fourth quarter. And then secondly, as I mentioned, we have some very specific profit improvement initiatives, including real focus on operational excellence. And again, making sure we have the right cost structure in that business that we also have a very focused effort regarding growing specific product lines that we need to continue to grow in that business to make it a profitable business going forward. So back to your original question, 2 key drivers for the fourth quarter: one, we will have worked through the high-priced product; and secondly, we have a very focused profit improvement effort in place in that business, and I think we'll see the impact from both of those in the fourth quarter.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. But it is safe to say that maybe more of the benefit of the performance improvement initiatives are -- will be seen in 2014, or just in terms of the time frame of completing some of those initiatives?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Sure. Sure, Anthony. Yes, we will see the initial -- I mean, we've been working on it, but we'll see, like I said, some of them in the fourth quarter. But it's not just solely in the fourth quarter. We will continue to build those into 2014 and beyond. So these aren't onetime initiatives. This is an ongoing effort to improve the operations of our distribution business.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching to Timberlands. Do you think that this quarter's EBITDA contribution from Longview, adjusting for the fact that you only had 2 months, is representative of what the business could do over the next few quarters? And do you have any updated view on synergies or the time frame to realize those synergies?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Sure. In terms of Longview, like I said, we're excited about that acquisition and are pleased with the results in the third quarter. To your specific question, I think the third quarter adjusted for the things you just said is generally representative. The other thing I would say is as you know, third quarter in the West tends to be, seasonally, a weak quarter, so you should factor that in as you think about this acquisition going forward as well. In terms of synergies, as we've previously stated, we anticipate synergies -- achieving synergy savings of approximately $20 million. And I would tell you we are on track to achieve those synergies by the end of 2014 at a run rate.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just -- I want to come back to distribution again because you've now got another publicly traded peer out there with the distribution business. They've made $21 million the last 2 quarters. You guys have lost $27 million. I mean, how much of this do you think is maybe just different treatment from an inventory standpoint? And what are the other issues here? Because it's a huge delta.", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes, Mark, we understand the delta that is in place. I can tell you I think part of it does have to do with -- my guess is, and it's only a guess because I don't know what our competitors do, but I think part of it may have to do, at least in the third quarter, with the treatment of inventory. As I mentioned earlier though, we understand the gap and the opportunities and challenges that we have in that business, and we are focused on improving that business everyday.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Doyle, do you regard that business as somehow kind of intertwined with your Engineered Wood business, that especially you have to be in Distribution to be successful in Engineered Wood, or not?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Mark, we look each of our businesses individually, and we expect each of our businesses to achieve above cost of capital returns over a cycle.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just in Wood Products, you talked a lot about improving cost of things. Are you doing anything just to kind of rethink maybe how Weyerhaeuser has approached markets from the commercial side? In other words, thinking about how you sell, how you go-to-market, whether you're really kind of getting the best dollar you can for everything you produce?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Sure, Mark. As I mentioned in my initial comments on Wood Products, one of our key focuses is delivering products that our customers want and are willing to pay for. And a big part of that is who our customer base is, how we go to market. As you know, we have very -- we produce very high-quality products here at Weyerhaeuser, and I think our customers appreciate that. And we just need to make sure we have got the right customer base in place and that we're delivering quality products that our customers want and are willing to pay for.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "All right. And the last question I had is just on the Timberland side. Your log prices were down quite a bit quarter-to-quarter, but I notice that you're export mix skewed to China. I know they typically buy lower-priced logs. I just -- I wondered whether kind of a mix shift in where you were selling contributed to that $10-drop in log -- average log prices.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, as you -- we talked about on the quarter outlook for the third quarter on our last call, pricing was projected to be weaker in the third quarter because of the seasonality, and we did see that. And now we're starting to see those prices move up again. In terms of the mix, we do have a higher percentage of the total mix going to China. Part of that is because of the Longview acquisition of just exporting more into China overall. So I think from a mix perspective, China does impact that a little bit, but we did say that pricing would come down somewhat in the third quarter, as it does on a seasonal basis.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "First question is as we look at your -- the company's last couple of years, capital spending has been quite a bit below the depreciation, and that's understandable because of the purchase accounting and -- some of it is at least, and depletion. But I mean, Doyle, as you look at things, do you think something down in the sub-250 range, is something that's sustainable, or could there possibly be opportunities either in the Wood Products business or maybe a requirement for boiler rebuild or something in the Cellulose business that we should keep an eye out? In other words, should we see CapEx remain at about half of depreciation?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Chip, we're -- as I mentioned earlier, I've been spending a lot of time with our senior management team over the past few weeks, and we are right in the middle of that process regarding capital. That's something that we will share with you at the December 17 meeting and probably even get more specific when we release fourth quarter earnings. I can tell you generally, Chip, in terms of our financial priorities going forward, first and foremost, is going to be to return cash to shareholders, primarily through a growing and sustainable dividend. But also, at the appropriate time, share repurchase. Second will be to invest in our businesses through high-return projects and look for opportunistic growth opportunities. And then finally, making sure we maintain the appropriate capital structure for our shareholders going forward. So that's generally how we think about it. But again, we'll be back to you with much more detail in a couple of months.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up. I know that in -- a couple of years ago, the company changed the way they did maintenance in the Cellulose business and found a way, I believe, to cut costs by shifting from annual to, I guess, every 18 months. And I didn't know if that's something that you felt was good and likely to be sustained, or if you think that there could be some tweaking to the way you look at the costs, especially for maintenance in the Cellulose business.", "Doyle R. Simons", "I think -- Chip, thanks for the question. I think that is something that's good and will continue. As you know, we are in the process of phasing that in, and I think we'll start to really see the benefits of that in 2014 and 2015. But I think that is the right approach. It ultimately, over time, will lower your maintenance expense and also a key benefit of that, of course, is you improve your productivity because you're not going down as often in your mill system.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First question is can you give us an update on the restart of the Alabama engineered wood products facility? How much capital do you think you'll need to put in to get that up and going? And how do you see the trajectory of the volumes out of that facility going into the market?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure, Alex, thanks. I think the important thing to keep in mind about our Evergreen mill in Alabama is that we announced that we would be restarting it. But the actual restart is not projected to take place until late spring of 2014, probably around in the May time frame before we'll actually producing significant product at that location. Anytime you're starting up a mill that's been down for more than a year, it certainly takes time to put a workforce in place. And so we're very focused on doing that. From a capital perspective, we will need to put some capital into that mill because it has been down for some period of time. But it's not a huge increment of capital. So I think that as the market continues to recover, especially for engineered wood, we're really looking forward to bringing that capacity online at a time that the market will really need it.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then on lumber, as I look at your shipment numbers quarterly relative to what you state is your capacity number for lumber in the 10-K, it seems like you're essentially running at capacity even though housing is well below normal levels. As you think about the medium term, do you expect you will be able to grow your lumber shipments with the market without having to put significant capital into your system? Or will you have to put in a significant capital to be able to do that, given you're essentially running at capacity based on the numbers that are reported?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Alex, I would say we're running somewhere in the low- to mid-90s in terms of operating rates in our lumber operation. And what we're focused on every day is improving our reliability in our lumber operations and doing things to get additional production where it makes sense to do that. So that's the focus of our lumber operation going forward.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just one more question on pulp. Softwood inventories are in excellent shape, prices are moving up while, on the other hand, hardwood inventories are elevated and prices are moving lower. There seems to be a significant amount of hardwood inventory that -- hardwood capacity that will be coming online over the next 12 months. As you talk to your customers, what kind of impact do you think all this new hardwood capacity that's entering the market, what kind of impact do you think it may have on softwood pricing and your Softwood business?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, Alex, it's difficult to know exactly what the impact will be, but our products from a fluff perspective are really focused more in the softwood grade. And in addition to fluff, we have a number of specialty proprietary products in the fluff grade spectrum. So our focus really is on, as Doyle said, is to continue to drive down costs, which is always a good thing. And then really in our product mix, in addition to our products today, to developing new products. In the priorities for the business that Doyle spoke to in his comments, #2 priority was innovation around specialty products, things like the product that we announced, which we call THRIVE, which is a cellulose-based product that has some promise for us going forward in terms of the automotive industry and others. So we're working on all fronts. But difficult to know exactly what that hardwood capacity will be, but it doesn't substitute directly for fluff today.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Two questions. How much of the improvement in Engineered Wood was attributable to the lower OSB prices? And second, you commented a little bit on the increased sales from Longview to China. China for you has been relatively low margin. Is there an opportunity to move some of that Longview capacity into higher-margin markets, or is this just going to be a shift a little bit down in the overall mix?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Mark, I'll try to address your first question, and then I'll ask Patty to address your second question. In terms of the improvement in ELP in the quarter, I don't know exactly how much of that was attributable to the lower OSB cost. But as I mentioned, it's a -- it was a -- the improvement was a combination of lower cost and improved revenues in that business.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "So Mark, as you think about the Longview acquisition, one of the things that you are not seeing as much of an impact in terms of the overall revenue, and that chart is a revenue chart that's in the web slide, is that we actually did purchase, through third-party purchases from Longview, some logs to go to Japan to round out our inventory needs for Japan, as we do on the marketplace. So that's why you don't see the significant change there. It's not that Longview logs are not going to Japan. They're now going as Weyerhaeuser logs. The other thing that I would say is as the light wood market becomes stronger, we will take advantage of shipping whitewood off, to the extent that we have it, off the coastal lands of Longview to take advantage of both the China market, as well as the Korea market. So the mix will move around, but we will ship the appropriate log to the appropriate market to get the best margin out of that. One of the opportunities for us in terms of driving synergies from that acquisition is that even though we were purchasing logs from Longview, we now have the trees and we have the opportunity to merchandise the cutting of the tree into logs to get that -- pull the highest grade to the highest market for that. So we, as Doyle said, really are very pleased with what we've seen so far.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "A quick question on Japan. How should we look at the effect of the consumption tax increase next April? And how do you expect that to flow through in terms of timing on export log sales to that country and the magnitude of the drop-off once that tax is in?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure, Paul. Difficult to know because the consumption tax is just one of the factors that affect the demand. Right now, we're seeing very strong demand. There is projected to be a small move up in the consumption tax, but the Japanese government has also -- proving to be very accommodative to housing financing. So I think that if that consumption tax does move up as it is projected, that we'll also likely we see some potential benefit to the overall housing economy in Japan. So difficult to know, but our own view at this point would be that demand will continue to be strong in 2014. It may have some slight impact from the consumption tax. But it is something that we're monitoring pretty closely.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then I just had a follow-up question for Doyle. Just you've been there almost 3 months now. What's most impressed you at Weyerhaeuser? Where do you see your biggest challenge?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Thank you for the question. And I would tell you when I showed up at Weyerhaeuser, I spent the first few weeks going around to our facilities, meeting our people and really listening -- learning and listening a lot. Over the past few weeks, as I think I mentioned earlier, I have been spending a lot of time with our senior management team, kind of distilling everything that I learned when I was out visiting our facilities, kind of figuring out where we are, where we need to go and how we're going to get there. And that will be the focus of our Investor Meeting on December 17. And at that point in time, we'll spend a lot of time highlighting, like I said, where we are and what our biggest opportunity -- what our biggest strengths are and what our biggest opportunities are as we move this company going forward. So I look forward -- we look forward to sharing those thoughts with you on December 17.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Evan Wingren with D.A. Davidson.", "Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Given that a lot of your competitors have seen sort of log prices in the south up a little bit this quarter, I noticed that yours were flat. Was that surprising to you, given -- kind of given what we heard about the wet weather in the South as well?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Our log prices in the South, as you mentioned, we did not see much of a movement. There were, in various regions, impacts because of the significant wet weather. I think that's a portion of what you've seen in some of the competitors. Also, there may be some different inventory situations for various competitors as well. What I am encouraged about is, I think when you step back and look at it overall, I believe our pine sawtimber prices this year will be up probably 4% to 5% versus last year, when all is said and done. And probably more encouragingly as we continue to see housing rebound, demand continues to grow, we see the impacts of the Canadian situation, I'm convinced that we will see sawtimber, pine sawtimber prices in the South start to -- continue to increase, maybe even more rapidly as we move into 2014 and beyond.", "Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "And kind of moving to Cellulose, the additional 6 days of maintenance you took, could you maybe just give a little more color on that? And maybe how much did that cost you in the quarter, if you could provide that as well?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes. Part of the impact in the quarter was due to the additional downtime that we took. And above and beyond the downtime that was scheduled, we had a couple of additional downtimes at our liquid packaging operation that were a result of not coming up quite as well as we had planned in that operation. So that had a impact on the third quarter versus the second quarter as well. Now the good news is the liquid packaging operation is back up and running and running well, and there will be no impact from that shutdown in the fourth quarter.", "Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "All right, fair enough. And then on EWP again, I mean, do you have a range that you can provide maybe of what you think utilization rate was in that business during the quarter?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes. Overall, there's a lot of different products, as you know, in that business. But overall, the operating rates were in the mid-60s for ELP in the quarter.", "Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "And on the pricing side of that, are you seeing momentum sort of heading into the back half of the year, or maybe just sort of what are the trends you're seeing there on pricing, just moving forward?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes. As we indicated, prices were up in the third quarter versus the second quarter in ELP. And I think, clearly, the trend is for favorable pricing going forward. Now we've got to factor in the seasonality. And as Patty properly highlighted and as you very well know, the fourth quarter tends to be a slower seasonal period for Wood Products, including ELP. But I think we will see favorable trends in pricing in ELP going forward.", "Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "And just one more kind of housekeeping. I sort of missed the extinguishment of debt cost, $24 million. Could you just bring that back real quick?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure. So when we acquired Longview Timberlands, that acquisition, we assumed debt in that acquisition and we repaid that debt early, in October. And as a result of repaying it early, there were some prepayment costs associated with that, and we expect that there'll be about $24 million of loss from early extinguishment of debt. That will be in the fourth quarter number. So I just wanted to make sure that you all have that number as you think about putting together your fourth quarter estimates.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "In the past, Weyerhaeuser has indicated their intent over the cycle to pay out roughly 75% of free cash flow in dividends. If as, through actions that you take, an increasing proportion of your cash generation in the future is coming from the more stable timber business, does that lend an upward bias to that 75% number?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Mark, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of our financial priorities, first and foremost is returning cash to shareholders primarily through a growing and sustainable dividend. So one of the things that we'll be continuing to monitor going forward is just exactly what the right payout ratio is in terms of our FAD contribution. So that's something we'll be looking at. But we understand and are committed to -- we understand the importance of and are committed to a growing and sustainable dividend going forward.", "Okay, as I understand it, there are no additional questions. So let me just close with a couple of comments. Let me start by thanking everybody for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in our company. And also, I just want to say, I look forward to seeing everybody on December 17 in the -- at the meeting that we will be hosting in New York.

I will now turn the conference over to Kathryn McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Kathryn F. McAuley", "Thank you, Carmen. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's 2013 results. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, and materials can be found at our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.", "On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle. Doyle?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Our vision here at Weyerhaeuser is to grow a truly great company for our shareholders, customers and employees. 2013 was a very good year, as we made initial progress toward achieving this goal by doubling net earnings, excluding special items from $316 million or $0.58 per diluted share in 2012 to $654 million or $1.14 per diluted share in 2013; increasing our dividend by nearly 30%; announcing an agreement to combine our Real Estate operation with TRI Pointe Homes and a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction; and acquiring approximately 645,000 acres of some of the finest timberland in the country through the purchase of Longview Timber. As a result of our actions in 2013 and our relentless focus on operational excellence going forward, we are well positioned to fully capitalize on improving markets and drive value for our shareholders in 2014 and beyond.", "Speaking of improving markets, let me just comment on economic conditions that affect our company before I discuss our fourth quarter performance. First, the housing market. The housing market continued to improve in 2013, with total starts rising to 923,000, an 18% gain from 2012. The housing recovery showed resilience as construction activity increased in the fourth quarter, having adjusted to higher interest rates and market uncertainty caused by fiscal infighting, which impacted the second and third quarters. Housing fundamentals remain positive with low inventories and affordability still well above historic norms. In addition, prices for existing homes have increased 14% on a year-ago basis and the additional homeowner wealth is a boost to the economy. The economy has been adding jobs, and as people find employment, they are forming households and adding to the demand for housing. These trends are expected to continue in 2014, and we are planning for over 1.1 million starts, including 780,000 single-family.", "I'll comment briefly on global economic conditions since approximately 1/3 of our revenues come from exported products from our Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands and Wood Products segments. As the Eurozone continues to manage its debt crisis and emerges from recession, the currency has stabilized and strengthened. A stronger euro should improve the relative competitiveness of our Cellulose Fiber business, as well as our Asian log exports. In Japan, fiscal and monetary reforms have stimulated the economy and increased housing starts, which has improved demand for our products. In China, our export activity picked up in 2013, and while many forecasts of overall economic growth in China have been lowered, the government continues with its objective of moving people from rural to urban settings. This is the driver of construction activity and the source of China's growing demand for imported wood.", "Now I will comment on our fourth quarter performance. For the fourth quarter 2013, we reported net earnings of $43 million or $0.07 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. We have several special items in the quarter, the largest of which was the previously announced noncash impairment of a community excluded from the combination of WRECO and TRI Pointe Homes. Charges for special items were partially offset by some unrelated tax adjustments, which Patty will discuss in more detail. Excluding these special items, we reported solid fourth quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with net earnings of $143 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, Charts 4 to 6. Timberlands contributed $134 million to earnings in the quarter, up 14% compared with the third quarter 2013 as construction markets in China drove increased demand for Western logs. Our Western fee harvest volumes were up by 17% due to the stronger demand and a full quarter of harvest from the Longview land. I'm pleased to report that the Longview integration continues to go smoothly and that we are on track to achieve or exceed our EBITDA and synergy goals.", "Turning to market condition. Selling prices for Western logs were generally higher in the quarter, while our sales realizations were flat due in part to a higher percentage of logs exported to China compared with higher value logs to Japan. Southern log price realizations were up modestly. As expected, road and silviculture costs were high in the quarter and the contribution from the sale of nonstrategic Timberlands declined by $3 million in the quarter.", "Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Wood Products contributed $58 million before special items to earnings in the quarter, down from $79 million in the third quarter but above the $38 million of earnings in the fourth quarter of 2012. Special items for the fourth quarter included noncash impairment charges of $10 million related to the permanent closure of previously curtailed engineered wood products operation. Sales volume declined across all product line in the quarter due to seasonality and unusually severe winter weather. OSB prices were lower in the quarter, while lumber and engineered wood sales price realizations were higher.", "Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $88 million compared with $110 million in the third quarter. In lumber, EBITDA was down $7 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, as lower volumes due to seasonally weaker demand, extreme weather conditions and higher log cost more than offset the benefit from higher prices. In OSB, EBITDA declined by $15 million compared with the previous quarter due to 4% lower prices and 11% less volume due to seasonality, as well as extreme winter weather and capital-related downtime. Engineered wood products generated EBITDA before special items of $11 million in the quarter, down from the prior quarter due to a seasonal decline in sales volumes and, again, some weather-related production and transportation issues. And finally, EBITDA and distribution improved by $5 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, primarily due to increased product margin. As we discussed in our December 17 investor presentation, we are committed to improving the EBITDA in both engineered wood products and distribution by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 compared with 2013.", "Cellulose Fibers, Charts 9 and 10. Cellulose Fibers contributed $65 million to earnings in the quarter, up $18 million from third quarter 2013 and up $4 million compared with fourth quarter 2012. The improvement, compared with third quarter 2013, was attributable to higher pulp price realizations, lower maintenance expenses and improved productivity due to fewer maintenance outage days. These were partially offset by higher fiber cost and lower realizations from liquid packaging board. Fourth quarter liquid packaging board sales included a smaller proportion of higher-value products. We expect a return to our typical mix in the first quarter.", "Real Estate, Charts 11 to 13. WRECO reported strong results as Real Estate contributed $71 million to earnings before special items in the quarter. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter includes special charges of $349 million primarily associated with the previously announced impairment. The improvement, compared with the prior quarter, was attributable to a 40% increase in single-family closings, an 11% increase in average prices and single-family gross margins of 23%.", "I will now turn it over to Patty to specifically address our first quarter outlook.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thank you, Doyle. Good morning, everybody, and happy new year. Notwithstanding the harsh weather that much of the country has been experiencing, 2014 appears to be off to a good start with a steadily improving economy and housing starts for 2014 forecasted to increase by approximately 20% over 2013. The outlook for the first quarter is on Chart 15, and I'll begin my comments with Timberland. Export log volumes to both Japan and China are expected to increase during the quarter. The pricing momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter is carrying over to the first quarter. A higher percentage of Japan volume relative to the fourth quarter, as well as an increased percentage of Douglas fir logs to China, are anticipated to contribute to strong price realizations. The robust export markets are also putting upward pressure on domestic log price. Westerns fee harvest is expected to increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter in order to take advantage of the stronger markets. By contrast, the pricing dynamic in the South continues to be less robust. Log prices are expected to increase only slightly, while fee harvest volumes are expected to decrease by approximately 5%. Slightly lower road maintenance and silviculture spending in the West will be offset by slightly higher costs in the South. We expect that the effect of the strong operating earnings for the segment in the first quarter will be largely offset by decreased earnings from nonstrategic land sales. In the fourth quarter, we had earnings from nonstrategic land sales of approximately $20 million, and we anticipate the first quarter sales will be minimal. As a result, we expect overall first quarter earnings in the Timberland segment will be comparable to slightly higher relative to the fourth quarter results. The outlook for fee harvest volume for the full year of 2014 is expected to increase by approximately 10% to 12%, mostly as a result of the Longview Timber acquisition in July of last year.", "In Wood Products, with the seasonally softer fourth quarter behind us and an improving housing market outlook, we expect Wood Products sales volumes to increase across all product lines in the first quarter. Channel inventories remain at low levels. Lumber sales prices have continued to increase thus far in the quarter, and we expect stronger realizations in the first quarter relative to the fourth. By contrast, OSB pricing has been softer thus far, and we expect overall realizations for the full quarter will be slightly weaker compared to the fourth quarter. Engineered wood products demand is anticipated to decrease (sic) [increase], although realizations will be slightly lower due to product mix. Log costs are expected to increase, especially in the West, consistent with our Timberlands outlook.", "Increased operating rates should lead to lower unit manufacturing costs. However, the wildcard is the severe weather conditions that we've experienced in January, especially in the South. Operating postures and rates are being adversely affected by the extreme cold and great recovery decreases due to frozen logs. Transportation availability is also limited by treacherous road condition. We do expect these harsh weather conditions to begin to moderate as we move through the quarter and anticipate that the stronger market conditions will result in higher earnings in the Wood Products segment in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.", "Moving to Cellulose Fibers. The year ended with global softwood pulp inventories at approximately 24 days, which is below the normal range of 28 to 32 days. Pulp sales volumes are anticipated to decline slightly as a result of the timing of shipments. Higher liquid packaging sales realizations and volumes are expected to offset the effect of the pulp sales decrease. Maintenance spending will be somewhat higher, and labor costs are also expected to increase slightly. We anticipate higher fiber costs in the West. Overall earnings in our Cellulose Fiber segment is expected to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.", "In Real Estate, the first quarter of the year is historically a seasonally weaker quarter for home closings compared to the fourth. This year is no exception. We expect to close approximately 600 homes in the first quarter, down from 1,072 in the fourth quarter. However, this is a 30% increase over the 463 closings in the first quarter of last year. Margins are anticipated to be around 20% to 21%, which is lower than the fourth quarter but comparable to the first quarter a year ago. We have 13% more homes in backlog as of December 31 compared to a year ago at prices 29% higher than a year ago. The number of actively selling communities at the end of 2013 is 35% greater than the prior year. We expect the selling costs in the first quarter will decrease relative to the fourth quarter as a result of fewer home closings. Consistent with the normal seasonal pattern, we expect that first quarter earnings from our single-family home-building business will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter but better than the breakeven results of a year ago.", "Our previously announced combination of our Real Estate business with TRI Pointe Homes is on track to close in the second quarter of this year. We continue to be excited by the value creation of this powerful combination. The requisite registration statement was filed at the beginning of this month, and we have received clearance under our Hart-Scott-Rodino filing. We continue to work through the remaining steps to close the transaction.", "Now I'd like to touch briefly on unallocated items, which are shown on Chart 14. Excluding special items, unallocated expense in the fourth quarter increased by $49 million compared to the third. Almost half of that difference relates to a smaller favorable impact from the elimination of intersegment profit and inventory and LIFO as a result of changes in inventory level. Amounts in the other category for the fourth quarter include charges for environmental and litigation reserves and other miscellaneous items with no single item greater than $5 million.", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial highlights. We ended the year with a cash balance of approximately $835 million. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $114 million, bringing our total spending for the full year to $293 million. For 2014, we expect the capital spending will be approximately $390 million, consistent with the guidance we shared during our Investor Meeting in December. During the fourth quarter, we completed the financing for the Longview Timber acquisition, and we also repaid all third-party WRECO debt. As of year end, we had approximately $4.9 billion in total debt with no maturities until 2017. During 2013, we replaced our revolving line of credit with a new agreement with $1 billion of capacity, and the agreement does not expire until June 2018. There are no borrowings outstanding under the line.", "As Doyle mentioned, we had significant positive tax adjustments in the quarter, which we have called out as special items in our earnings material. These adjustments follow the completion of examinations by taxing authorities covering multiple years in both the U.S. and Canada. The largest of these relates to the exclusion from income of our alternative fuel mixture credit claimed in 2009. Looking forward to 2014, we expect our tax rate for our taxable REIT subsidiary earning to be approximately 33% to 35%, and of course, we accrue no taxes on REIT income as they plan to distribute all taxable income of the REIT to our shareholders.", "Now I want to wrap up with an update on our pension and postretirement plans. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to close defined benefit pension plans to employees hired after 2013. We replaced both plans with defined contribution plans. We also made plan amendments to certain of our other post-employment benefit plans. Factoring in these changes, as well as the strong investment earnings and increased discount rate, the funded status of our plans as of December 31, 2013, improved by approximately $1.45 billion compared to the funded status as of December 2012. Cash paid for all plans in 2013 totaled $137 million. We expect total spending in 2014 to approximate $110 million. Consistent with last year, we do not expect to contribute any cash to our U.S. qualified plan, which is fully funded. Our primary contributions will be to our Canadian plan for approximately $55 million, with the remainder going to pay benefits under our supplemental retirement plan and our other post-employment benefit plans, neither of which are separately funded.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.", "Doyle R. Simons", "Thank you, Patty. As I said earlier, 2013 was a very good year for Weyerhaeuser as we doubled our earnings before special items, significantly increased our dividend and positioned ourselves for the future through significant transactions. But we still have a lot of work runway in front of us. As we look ahead, we are excited about 2014 and are relentlessly focused on growing shareholder value by driving our performance through operational excellence and capitalizing on improving markets to increase our cash flow and grow our dividend.", "So with that, operator we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions for you. So first on the cost savings in the distribution and EWP business where we're targeting $30 million to $40 million for 2014. How should we think about how that flows through the model through the course of the year? Do you start to see that in the -- as early as the first quarter?", "Doyle R. Simons", "We'll start to see some improvement in the first quarter, Alex, but it's not going to -- and it will be all throughout the year. So you can't take the $30 million and $40 million, divide it by 4 and it's going to be even. It actually will build throughout the year as we gain traction on the initiatives that we outlined in our December 17 presentation.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful, Doyle. And then just looking at the price performance of OSB relative to lumber, lumber has been so much more robust over the last 6 months. Typically, they historically move together. Can you just talk about the supply-demand dynamics that you're seeing and always be relative to lumber that may be driving some of that delta?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Sure. And in terms of -- we'll start with lumber. In terms of lumber, supply and demand dynamics are favorable. What we've seen, of course, is improvement in demand as housing starts have continued to grow. And on the supply side of the equation, Alex, while there have been some restarts and everybody's ramping up production, supply and demand are in pretty good balance. On the other hand, in OSB, as you're very well aware, while we have seen improvement on the demand side, there have been some significant restarts and new facilities that have come online, and that's what's led in our opinion to the volatility in OSB pricing over the past few quarters. And I think that will continue until we see supply and demand getting more in balance.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That makes sense. And just one housekeeping question. The EWP facility that's primarily closed, how much capacity was that?", "Doyle R. Simons", "I don't know that exact figure off the top of my head. We'll tell you, Alex, if that is and we'll get back to you with that. That is the last facility that we had that had been curtailed. And now -- and so all of our facilities are now either running or have been permanently closed at this point.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Alex, the facility was in Colbert, Georgia. As Doyle said, it was closed for some number of years, but it was about 3 million cubic feet, and it was a Parallam facility.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "A couple of questions, I guess. First, on the lumber pricing, I know this is random, land was up about $35 looking at the composite. Obviously, you're in lots of different geographies, et cetera. But why -- your price is only up $9. Was that really just a geography and mix thing? Or do you sometimes lock in pricing early in the quarter and maybe that can affect things as well?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Mark, you thought you might ask this question so here's what's going on. Very little blocking in prices. Actually what happened as we dug into this is, as you know, random leaks takes into account a variety of grades and widths. But it's mostly 2x4s and 2x10s, and that's normally pretty reflective of what's happening in the overall market. This quarter, mid-widths, which is 2x6, 2x8s, which are not included -- or not generally included in Random Lengths but are 40% of our volume at Southern Yellow Pine, were down 9%. So this is a quarter where random lengths, because of the mix and everything, went -- was significantly different than what our actual experience was. Now if you look at it overall, and we went back to compare it year-over-year, we're right on top of Random Lengths. Just this happens to be one quarter where the 2 are out of sync.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay, got it, very helpful. So I just want to -- also, on the pension, so does that mean you ended the year at about like $100 million to $200 million underfunded? Am I doing the right math there, Patty?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, as you add all of our plans together, so that's a combination of our pension plans, as well as our post-employment benefit plan, they'll total about just under $500 million underfunded. If you look at just the pension plans themselves, it's really the Canadian plans that are underfunded. So you're about right on that number. But the total underfunded as we think about all of those. And as I mentioned, we don't fund the supplemental plan or the post-employment plan. So just pension alone, you're pretty much right, but altogether will be just under $500 million.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And then lastly, has there been any further thought on -- I believe you got like $700 million, $730 million of cash from the TRI Pointe transaction, as well as the shares going to shareholders. Has there been any further thought on the use for that money?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Mark, as you know, and as we shared with the group in December, as we think about our financial priorities going forward, including the $700 million, first and foremost, we were focused on returning cash to shareholders. That will be primarily through a growing dividend going forward, but also through share repurchase where appropriate. Second is going to be investing on our business, again, through higher return projects to improve our cost structure and our margin. And we'll also look for opportunities to grow our business, but we'll be very disciplined in doing that through acquisitions that create value. And then finally, maintaining the appropriate capital structure to support a growing dividend, and we shared some of those metrics with you in December. So I give you that background just to say we are -- look, we understand the amount of cash we're getting. We understand the cash on the balance sheet. And we will, as we move forward through the TRI Pointe transaction, we'll be making decisions with what to do with that -- with the proceeds from that and exactly whether we're going to do a spin or split in all that. So what you could anticipate is we won't make a decision on -- we probably won't make a decision on the dividend until we have completed the TRI Pointe transaction, and then we'll be back to you at that point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Some housekeeping. I apologize if you already answered some, been doing a couple of calls at once here. First of all, Patty, did you say what the amount of pension expense will be in the P&L this year? I did catch the funding, but I'm not sure I caught the expense. And then the other housekeeping item, did you mention what was in the rather large tax adjustment in the fourth quarter? What drove that?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure. Yes, George, you guys have had a busy week. So let me -- in terms of answering the pension and postretirement expense, maybe the way to think about that would be to look at Chart 18 that's in the material. I did not give you the expense number in my prepared remarks. But as you look at that chart, if you looked at what we had for expense in 2013, in total, it's about $100 million. In 2014, the total expense will be just about flat. So we really won't have any expense to speak of. Now as you think about the business segments though, we do charge the segments their normal service cost. So overall service cost in the business segment was, I think, around $60 million in 2013. That will come down to around $40 million because the service cost comes down as the discount rate increases, and the discount rate did increase year-over-year.", "That $40 million offset then will be in the allocated segment as income in the unallocated segment because we want to make sure from a business perspective that we are charging the normal service cost into the business segment, so hopefully that's helpful there. On the tax, yes, I did speak to that. We had a number of years under examination, both in the U.S. and Canada, that we completed in the fourth quarter. You might recall, in the third quarter filing, in the 10-Q, we said that it was reasonably possible that we would be releasing up to $160 million of FIN 48 or unrecognized tax benefits as a result of those examinations, and that, that would be primarily related to the alternative fuel mixture credit. Remember, those go back to 2009. We had included the credit in income, and we had provided a FIN 48 reserve for those that now has been resolved. And so that's the reason, primarily the biggest part of the tax reserves that we released in the quarter.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Last question, and I'll turn it over. Totally different topic. Doyle, in the past, the company had a number of what I'd call incubation-like businesses within Cellulose Fibers. And years back, there was talk about carbon replacement products being generated by Weyerhaeuser. Obviously, you've had the jet fuel venture. How do you see those playing out over time within Cellulose Fibers? Do you see them as still viable in an environment where you are pursuing operational excellence obviously? Are there areas perhaps where there's been investment spending that maybe that needs to come down at some point?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Thanks for the question, George. And I'll tell you, at Weyerhaeuser, to your point, innovation has been a core value and will continue to be a core value going forward. With that said, what we -- as we go through the process we're going through on operational excellence, George, we're become -- going to go become very focused to where we're innovating where it adds value to the bottom line. So we want to make sure that the monies that we spend, the effort that we spend on R&D and innovation ultimately results in a benefit to our bottom line. So as we move forward, that's part of the process we're in, is making sure we have direct alignment, again, between the funds that are being spent, the effort that's being spent on innovation and how we ultimately drive value for our customers and for our shareholders.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just to start, can you just maybe take a step back and give some broader color on what you're seeing in the Wood Product market, particularly on 2 things, one, comparing it to last year where there was clearly a lot of panic and tension, and also just if you've seen any sort of response given -- and any change in your business just given the decline in the Canadian currency over the last month or so?", "Doyle R. Simons", "I'll take your first question on that, Patty, to address the Canadian currency situation, but you cut out or maybe we cut out a little bit when you said comparing it to last year where we saw something, and I didn't hear [indiscernible].", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes. Last year, there was just a lot of panic and tension. I mean, a lot of the supply hadn't come back yet that you had to jump in housing starts towards the end of the year. And I'm just wondering, have you seen your customers may be more cautious relative to last year given what happened with the price movement? Or given the fact that we did see another late year of ramp-up in housing activity, do they feel well prepared for the housing season that's coming up?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Sure. So let me talk specifics, and then I'll step back. If you look in terms of specifics, Gail, currently versus kind of the fourth quarter, lumber prices have continued to improve and are up probably $25 versus the fourth quarter average. OSB, as I mentioned, a little bit earlier, in response to a question, we've seen continued pressure there, and those prices are down somewhere probably in the $10 range. Specifically, regarding customers, I would tell you to your exact point, I think inventories are very lean. Customers are cautiously optimistic. They do remember kind of what happened last year. But I would tell you, as we talked to our customers, they are confident that we're going to continue to see growth in housing starts. And in fact, some of our customers' biggest concern at this point is will we have the supply to provide them with what they're going to need to service their customers going forward. So that's kind of how we characterize where we are versus where we were a year ago.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "And Gail, to your question about the Canadian currency, as you noted, the Canadian dollar has depreciated here of late. And typically, the effect of that is that it makes it easier for Canadian lumber to come into the United States. We really haven't seen a lot of impact as a result of that. That would be primarily the FPS that comes across, both from interior BC, as well as Eastern Canada. And as we've talked about in the past, from a supply perspective, the interior British Columbia is dealing with the Canadian pine beetle, and Eastern Canada is dealing with reductions in the allowable cut. The other piece that is a positive dynamic at that is that today, the export markets for lumber are much more robust than they were a few years ago when we saw a much weaker Canadian dollar. So it is something that we do track very closely. But so far, we haven't seen a big impact from that. And we also do have some Canadian production as well, so we are benefited to the extent that it will come to support.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just a couple more. Your cancellation rate seems to have moved up a bit in WRECO. I'm just wondering if there's anything out of the usual there.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes, Gail, good question. We really haven't seen anything that we would say would be a trend. It did move up in the fourth quarter, but we haven't seen anything that we would say is really a trend year-over-year. The cancellation rate is in line. I think as we look forward to the first quarter, it's really difficult to tell based on what's going on in the markets because of weather, really severe weather, which you know well better than we do here in the West. Because sitting here in Seattle, which we often complain about the rain, well, there are no complaints about our weather this year compared to what the rest of the country is experiencing. And that does hit for us in our Winchester subsidiary in the Washington, D.C., Virginia, Maryland area, as well as even in Houston, which we wouldn't think would be suffering cold weather, but even the South is being hit. But in talking with our Real Estate folks, there isn't anything that we see that we would say is a trend. Mortgage interest rates are going up a little bit, but it's not a huge significant thing at this point, but we'll stay tuned to that.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just a couple of quick modeling questions. I might have missed it, but can you give us any sort of guidance on what you'd expect the average price in WRECO to do in the quarter? Also, any guidance on the change in pulp downtime costs? And then just one quick last one after that.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure. The average price will increase relative to the fourth quarter. As you look at our backlog, the average price in the backlog is higher than what it has been in -- at the end of other quarters, so we'll enjoy that going into the first quarter. Margins will come down a little bit compared to the fourth quarter, really based on mix. To your question about maintenance spending, we'll have a little bit more maintenance spending, really more in the major maintenance area. The actual downtime won't be real significant. I would expect that overall, the increase in maintenance spending would be maybe $4 million to $5 million additional than from what we had in the fourth quarter.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then just quickly, I thought you mentioned your outlook for OSB, your guidance for Wood Products, you're assuming just a slight decline in OSB pricing? I just want to verify that I heard that, and does that imply that you're expecting a pretty healthy recovery through the balance of the quarter?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, we said that it would be weaker relative to the fourth quarter realizations. So it is one of those things that sitting here in January, it has weakened. We would hope that, that would not be the case as we -- weakening further as we go through the rest of the quarter and start to see the spring building season. But that's something that we'll have to track. I think January is a difficult month usually to forecast for the quarter because it's a weaker quarter -- or weaker month for the quarter. And as you know, again, we are being challenged more this quarter because of the weather impacts, so we'll just have to see what happens as we go forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLP.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I wonder if you can help us think about the magnitude of the profit difference between China and Japan, and how that's going to change, especially as you sell more Doug fir to China, which sounds like a good thing. And second question, can you remind us how different Longview's end markets are versus the rest of your Pacific Northwest business?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, in terms of Longview, I'll take that one first. They do have a high percentage of premium logs as compared to our Western market, so a good percentage of that will go to the Japan market, as well as they also have, though, on a specie mix, a little more whitewood, and that's what you saw in the fourth quarter pricing to China. The mix was more heavily than our typical mix to whitewood versus Douglas fir. As I mentioned in my remarks, we will be changing that mix, so that mix will change a little bit in the fourth quarter to send more Doug fir to China. Now Japan will always compete for the highest-value Doug fir log because of the fact that they do build housing in the traditional post-and-beam construction, for example. They build housing out of wood as opposed to China being more of a construction activity use of the wood. But those -- that historical gap between China and Japan has closed a little bit based upon the strength of the construction activity taking place in China.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And do you think that's going to keep narrowing, Patty?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, it's always difficult to tell because you've got the activity taking place, and it is the additional supply dynamics as well. But we -- as we sit here today for the first quarter, certainly continue to see very robust demand coming out of China. So I don't see anything that will change it in the near term and, I think, just both of those economies in the longer term. But our demand from Japan has been very stable as well. So we like the fact that we've got 2 very robust markets now that we are -- have the ability to ship wood into.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ketan Mamtora with Deutsche Bank.", "Ketan Mamtora - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones. Can you remind us what you have in the form of tax shields at this point, whether in oils or alternative fuel credits or anything of that kind?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "We do have some cellulosic biofuel products that we have to apply against our cash taxes. In terms of cash taxes, for example, in 2014, we don't expect to pay any additional cash taxes. I don't have the actual amount of the cellulosic biofuel credit, but you'll get a more detailed review of what we have in taxes, obviously when we file the 10-K, which will be here in the next couple of weeks.", "Ketan Mamtora - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right. But you do not expect any significant cash taxes in 2014?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Correct.", "Ketan Mamtora - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Got you. And then on EWP, I saw the prices were up quite nicely year-over-year. Can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in that business in terms of just overall pick up, and then if you can tell us what the operating rates were in all the Wood Products grades in Q4?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Sure. Let me just start with the operating rates, and then we'll go back to the -- what we saw in pricing. But in terms of operating rates in lumber in the fourth quarter, operating rates were roughly 85%. A portion of that fall from the third quarter had to do with weather-related items. In OSB, the operating rates were approximately 89%. And in ELP, we've ramped up production there. If you factor out all the closed facilities and started-up facilities, we're nearing -- we're at much higher rates than we've been over the past few quarters in EWP. In terms of pricing, we've been encouraged by what we've seen in EWP from the standpoint that EWP normally does lag. Lumber and OSB as housing has continued to improve. Over the past year or so, we've started to see gained traction in EWP pricing. And while that will be lumpy going forward, we would expect that trend to continue going forward.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes. And EWP pricing in terms of how we price the product, we aren't seeing a significant change in the first quarter. It really is a function -- the lower price realizations is really a function of mix in terms of the actual sale of the products that are going in. That business does have a very wide product mix ranging from TJIs to solid section to Timberstrand and Parallam, so it's really a mix that's moving that. Demand continues to be very good.", "Ketan Mamtora - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Got you. That's very helpful. And then just one last one. You mentioned a couple of times about weather. I was wondering if it is possible at this time to sort of quantify what that impact would be in Q1.", "Doyle R. Simons", "No. It's difficult to do for Q1 because we're right in the middle of it. As you know, I'm kind of just giving you a sense as every leader of every business that we have came to me yesterday and gave me an update on exactly the impact from weather. So whether it be in our Timberland, whether it be in our Wood Products operations or Cellulose Fiber, all of those are experiencing some impact from weather. Just for lumber, for example, we've already lost 20 days in our lumber operation due to either the impact from frozen logs or impact from roads being closed or whatever that -- or something freezing in one of our sawmills, so difficult to give any impact this point. We did do that exercise for fourth quarter. And I can tell you, in our Wood Products operation, which is where the impact was in the fourth quarter, that number was probably somewhere between $3 million to $5 million in the fourth quarter, and we'll be continuing to monitor the weather impact in the first quarter, as Patty said. As Patty said, we are hopeful that as we move forward through the quarter that the weather improves, and we can make up some of the impact that we've experienced over the last couple of weeks.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "So we'll be running some additional days in lumber, for example, to make up the additional volume that was lost in the additional days that Doyle was talking about, and that's primarily days in the South.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "First question is on looking at the land sales, you mentioned in the first quarter when you gave the guidance on the Timberland, it was excluding the land sales. And I know there's 2 components: What you sell and what you transfer. And I noticed -- I know the fourth quarter tends to be a big number, and the first quarter is low. In '13, that swing was about $25 million. Should we kind of see that kind of a swing as well where it might go from $30 million in the fourth of last year to something in the single digits in this quarter?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I think the way to think about it, Chip, is we had $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, and we really wouldn't see much at all in the first quarter of 2014, so that -- about a $20 million swing quarter-to-quarter.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you. And then could you give us some help on the interest expense you think you'd see for the year? And I know that you might have to qualify it, given the WRECO situation, but I know it popped up in the fourth quarter and -- as we expected. But what -- should we annualize that number x what we think happens to WRECO, or what would you have us do?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, Chip, remember that in the fourth quarter, we had a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, that was the Longview Timber debt, and we put that loss in interest expense. So be sure that as you look at the fourth quarter interest expense, you back out the $25 million early extinguishment that we called out for you as a special item. Past that, I think you've got the debt. The interest rates, I think, are all -- I mean, there's no change really there as well. So I think that, that will give you a pretty good guidance in terms of what to put in for the full year of 2014, and we don't have any maturities now coming due in 2014.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you. So $350 million to $355 million. And then on the -- you mentioned real quickly on the tax situation, at least for the black liquor part, I would imagine that's all noncash, is that right?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Yes. We do have, in terms of some refunds coming back in 2014. So it wasn't cash in 2013. But in 2014, as a result of closing out some of those examinations, we do expect to get some refunds back. That's one of the reasons why we have no cash taxes due in 2014 on a net basis.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay. And then the last thing is you mentioned in the guidance on the Cellulose segment, a little more maintenance, and I know there -- that there are a lot of moving parts as you go to a longer cycle for the mills. What -- can you give us some idea as to how that will unfold throughout the year? Will there, for example, be very high or very low maintenance quarters that you can identify at this point?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, yes, there will -- it will be lumpy because it will depend on what we do in terms of the mills, probably the biggest lumpiness will occur in our liquid packaging operation because we do have some capital projects to tie in later this year. I don't recall whether that's third quarter, but I think it is. So you will see some lumpiness through the year. On a year-over-year basis, other than that extended outage at Longview for that capital, it'll be pretty steady. It'll be different in terms of the mills, so where we take the maintenance. But the total amount will be up a little bit because of the liquid packaging extended maintenance outage. Other than that, not much difference. So in 2013, we had 1 mill that didn't have an outage. So our New Bern mills didn't have an outage in 2014. We've got 2 mills that won't take an outage, and then that will continue as we go through a full cycle of implementation.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "A question or comment. Just on the question, have you -- besides EWP and distributions' hard cost savings targets by the end of the year, have you been able to put a more definitive time line on the $260 million that you identified on that -- in the New York -- your New York Analyst Day in lumber must be in Cellulose Fibers?", "Doyle R. Simons", "In -- as I mentioned in December, we have set those targets. We will be working forward on those. You'll start to see those -- some of those bottom line improvements as early as the first quarter of this year, and then we will give you updates on a periodic basis or probably on an annual basis as to exactly where we are. So again, we don't know. Some of it's capital intensive, some of it's not. We don't know the exact timing. But I could tell you, we are focused everyday on executing against those specific initiatives and those operational excellence targets that we set forth. The other part of it that is near term just like EWP and distribution is the SG&A cost savings, which we indicated we would be at a run rate of $75 million lower by the end of this year, and we are confident that we will, in fact, achieve that.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Is there -- just for modeling, is there a range that you can give us for what you expect in '14?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Well, I mean, I think the range would be the things that you've outlined, the specific numbers on EWP, the specific numbers on distribution, the specific numbers on SG&A. And then again, you can -- it's not going to all be back-end loaded in the numbers. As we said, it's going to be a 2-, 3-, 4-year process. There will be some lumpiness, but there will be benefits that show up as early as the first quarter. And as early as the first quarter and clearly in by the end of 2014, we'll see some benefits. And again, the ultimate measure, as we said in December 17, is going to be our relative performance versus the competition, and I'm confident you're going to see that improved going forward.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Paul, the other thing that I would just caution a little bit on modeling is remembering that the cost target that we've given you, for example, in lumber, our cost targets of lowering our cost net of logs. As you know very well, the biggest percentage of cost in lumber is the log cost. So log cost is continuing to escalate, which is a good thing for us in terms of our Timberland business. But net-net to the lumber cost, if you were just looking at the P&L, the cost net of logs on a per 1000-board-feet number should be lowered, but the absolute number of cost will fluctuate based upon log cost.", "Operator", "And your last question will come from the line of Joshua Zaret with Longbow Research.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Doyle, in Timberlands, in what you call International Operations, which I assume is Uruguay, you've shown dramatic revenue growth over the last several years through 2012, and then it fell 15% in 2013. So a couple of questions related to that. One, what caused the downdraft in revenue and, I guess, earnings? And two, are there plans -- if I'm right, it's Uruguay. Can you tell us where the state of the forest and the converting operations are in their plans to double that revenue in the next whatever years?", "Doyle R. Simons", "So I'll try to answer your -- the second part of your question and then, as Patty did, to deal with the first. So Uruguay, as you indicated, is a primary component of our international operation. We are focused on continuing to grow trees there. As you may recall, Josh, we just planted those trees not that many years ago, so we're not in the full harvest mode at this point in time. So as time passes, we'll be able to generate additional revenue and earnings off of those -- off of that 300,000 -- approximate 300,000 acres of land in Uruguay going forward.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "And sure, Josh, the revenue in the international segment has fluctuated. It is only Uruguay as we sit here today. It has included some China. It has included some other smaller pieces. So -- and the other thing is that from time to time, it has included some land sales in Uruguay as well. But as we sit here today, it is purely focused on the Uruguayan operations. And the end product that we produce there is lumber appearance or panel -- appearance panel that we come out of there. The other thing that has been in international operations is we had a small joint venture in Brazil, which also has now been curtailed since a year ago. So going forward, I think, and especially as panel markets start to pick up, we will see some of that reverse.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So I mean, it's been consistent growth until last year. So you believe that will be back on track? And could -- but -- so could it have been land sales that caused that down or...", "Patricia M. Bedient", "It's likely the land sales. I don't have the detail of that in front of me. We would be happy to take it off-line and walk through it with you, there have been some land sales in Uruguay in the past. So there's some lumpiness that comes into that as well.", "Doyle R. Simons", "Okay. If I understand it, that was our last call. Let me just conclude by thanking everybody for your interest in our company and, as I mentioned earlier, goes to you all.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Thanks, everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you, again, for participating in today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to Kathy McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations. The floor is yours.", "Kathy McAuley ", "Thank you, Carmen. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2014 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found at our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website.", "On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer. Now, I will turn the call over to Doyle. ", "", "Doyle Simons", "", "Thank you, Kathy and good morning everyone, earlier today we reported first quarter net earnings of a 183 million or $0.31 per diluted share on net sales of 2 billion. Excluding special items we achieved solid first quarter net earnings of a 153 million or $0.26 per diluted share as our businesses delivered strong operating results despite unusually severe winter weather throughout much North America in the quarter. Special items in the quarter included a gain resulting from an amendment to a post retirement health care plan, a gain on sale of a non-strategic asset and restructuring charges associated with our previously announced SG&A cost reduction initiative. ", "I will begin this morning with a few comments on the housing market and overall economic conditions before turning to a discussion of our business results. The unusually severe winter weather dampened market momentum early in the year and housing starts in January and February declined slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with year ago levels. As the winter weather is moderated markets are improving, in March single family housing starts increased to 635,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, 2% higher than a year ago. Single family also comprised a greater percentage of total housing starts in March, compared with February. ", "Prices for existing homes are 13% higher than last year, and fundamentals of job growth and improving household formation support our expectation for continued recovery in the housing markets. Although the weather\u2019s disruption experienced during the past few months has slightly diminished the overall housing outlook for 2014, the market consensus continues to forecast significant growth compared with 2013 and we are planning for approximately 1.1 million starts including over 700,000 single family starts. Globally Chinese demand for our logs and pulp remains strong as the pace of orders rescinds following a normal seasonal slowdown associated with the Lunar New Year. ", "Orders from our Japanese customers weakened slightly at the conclusion of the first quarter due to uncertainty regarding the effect of the increased consumption tax. However Japan remains a very strong customer for our logs and we expect that demand will remain generally solid overall.", "Let me now turn to our business segment starting with Timberland, charts three to five, Timberlands had an outstanding quarter, contributing a 164 million to earnings, an improvement of more than 20% compared with last quarter, demand for western logs was strong in the quarter and prices rose in export and domestic markets. Operating margins improved due to higher harvest volumes and our operational excellence initiative. The strong performance of our western Timberlands business also reflects increasing benefits from the Longview timber acquisition which contributed 53 million of EBITDA in the quarter an improvement of 18 million from the fourth quarter. ", "In the south, log prices rose modestly, continuing the slow upward trajectory we observed in the fourth quarter. Wet weather resulted in lower southern sea harvest volumes as well as reduced silviculture spending. First quarter earnings from disposition and non strategic Timberlands are usually minimal and as expected, dispositions declined to 4 million in the quarter. Excluding dispositions, the segment earned a $160 million. This is the highest quarterly Timberlands\u2019 earnings excluding land sales since the second quarter of 2006. ", "Wood products, charts 6 and 7. Wood products earned 64 million, an improvement compared with the fourth quarter despite the effect of severe winter weather. Weather resulted in reduced sales volumes for most products as demand stalled and transportation challenges related to Canadian rail car and trucking availability made it harder to deliver products to our customers. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter improved to 93 million, compared with 88 million in the fourth quarter. In lumber, EBITDA improved by 17 million. This improvement is primarily attributable to increased lumber sales realizations which more than offset lower sales volumes and higher western log cost. ", "Operating rates improved and the business did a good job of controlling cost in the quarter despite weather related disruptions. In OSB, EBITDA declined by 10 million, as our prices fell by 3% and sales volumes declined by approximately 5%, manufacturing cost rose slightly as the business incurred higher energy and maintenance cost as a result of the extreme weather. ", "EBITDA for engineered wood products fell slightly compared to the fourth quarter due to cost associated with the startup of the Evergreen Alabama mill, and EBITDA for the distribution business improved by a $1 million despite a significant number of lost days due to weather related closures. Operational excellence efforts for all our wood products businesses remain on track and we expect to see additional benefits as the year progresses. ", "Cellulose fibers, chart 8 and 9, cellulose fibers contributed 54 million to earnings down from 65 million in the fourth quarter, despite the harsh weather, the mill system ran very well in the first quarter, average pulp price realizations rose as markets tightened due to lower levels of supply. ", "Energy costs were higher as a result of the weather and pulp sales volumes declined due to timing of shipment and Canadian transportation issues similar to those that affected our wood products businesses. As expected, maintenance expenses also rose due to an increase in a number of scheduled annual outage days. ", "Real estate \u2013 charts 10 to 12. WRECO contributed 12 million to first quarter earnings, down from earnings from four special items of 71 million in the fourth quarter. First quarter earnings included 2 million from land sales. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter for our real estate business and home closings declined seasonally, this is partly offset by an 8% increase in average prices and lower selling expenses due to the decreased closing volume. ", "Gross margins were approximately 21%. During the first quarter we made significant progress against our SG&A initiative to reduce costs by 75 million by 2014 year end. We incurred 18 million of restructuring charges in the quarter primarily for severance as efforts to simplify and streamline our processes and operations reduce our staffing needs, we are highly confident we will achieve our target run rate by year end 2014. ", "I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our second quarter outlook.", "", "Patty Bedient ", "Thanks Doyle, and good morning everybody. Although the housing market has gotten off to a slow start in 2014, we expect to see demand pick up as we move to the quarter. The harsh winter weather has now dissipated and the strength of underlying market fundamentals should begin to yield better results in the second quarter. The outlook is summarized on chart 14 and I\u2019ll begin my comments with Timberlands. ", "In the west, export prices are expected to soften somewhat but overall, demand and prices remained at favorable levels. The effect of the increased consumption tax is causing Japanese demand to weaken compared to the first quarter. However we expect that volumes to China will increase in the second quarter as activity returns to pre-holiday levels. Demand from domestic sawmills is also anticipated to increase as home building picks up, although prices will likely be somewhat softer. We expect increased log and haul costs as we begin to harvest sites with higher elevations and longer hauling distances. Silviculture costs are also expected to increase. ", "In the south we expect pricing to continue its slow but steady upward direction. Volumes are expected to increase slightly offset by higher silviculture costs. Dispositions of non-strategic land sales will be higher in the second quarter compared to the first with anticipated Q2 sales at approximately $20 million which will be substantially completed by the end of this month. Including the effect of these land sales, we expect that second quarter earnings in the Timberlands segment will be comparable to the first quarter. ", "In wood products, we expect that the seasonal pick up in home building will result in increased sales volumes across major product lines resulting in improved earnings in all businesses. Lumber sales realizations have softened thus far in the quarter, however they should stabilize as demand improves throughout the quarter. OSB prices appear to have bottomed out and we anticipate slightly improved realizations for the second quarter compared to the first. ", "Demand in engineered wood products is improving and we expect higher sales realizations during the quarter. In addition, our Evergreen Alabama plant is scheduled to begin shipping commercial product, high choice and microlam in May. ", "In our distribution business, customers are continuing to express signs of optimism and channel inventories are still at relatively low levels. On the cost side of the equation, we expect lumber manufacturing cost to improve with the higher production volumes and log cost will likely increase marginally due to seasonally higher log cost in Canada offsetting favourable variances in the west and south. OSB manufacturing costs are expected to remain flat as the positive effect of higher productivity is offset by slight increases in resin in some planned annual maintenance downtime.", "Engineered wood products manufacturing cost should improve especially for veneer cost, which were negatively impacted by adverse weather in the first quarter. Cost should also decrease as our Alabama plant moves from start-ups to production next month. Weather related transportation issues should moderate now that the extreme winter weather conditions are behind us. We anticipate overall earnings in our wood product segment to increase significantly in the second quarter compared to the first depending on the strength of the spring building season.", "Sales realizations in our Cellulose Fibers segment are expected to continue to improve. Global softwood pulp inventories were below normal at the end of the first quarter. Liquid packaging realization should also improve primarily due to higher grade mix. We expect lower energy and fiber cost given more favourable weather conditions compared to the first quarter. Maintenance costs are also expected to be slightly lower this quarter. Earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should increase significantly in the second quarter compared to the first.", "We expect improved results in our Real Estate segment as we move into the seasonally stronger second quarter and weather improves. We expect to close approximately 650 single family homes in the quarter, up from the 508 closed in Q1. We anticipate higher average home prices with margins similar to the first quarter of around 20%. Selling cost will increase due to the higher closing volume. Earnings from land and lot sales are also expected to improve moderately compared to the first quarter income of $2 million. Overall earnings in our Real Estate segment are expected to increase in the second quarter compared to the first.", "The earlier announced combination of our single family home building business with TRI Pointe Homes is on track and we anticipate closing just after the end of the second quarter. The decision of whether to distribute the shares using a spin or split will be made by the Weyerhaeuser Board likely later this quarter. We remain excited about the benefits of this transaction which should create an even more powerful homebuilder with additional long-term growth potential.", "Now, I would like to refer you to chart 13 and make some comments regarding unallocated items. As discussed in our earnings release three special items in the first quarter accounted for $49 million of pre-tax earnings. These items included a restructuring reserve of 18 million for our SG&A and R&D cost reduction initiative that we announced in December. Most of the first quarter reserve is for severance for identified personnel reductions across the company. The majority of these reductions are taking place over the remaining quarters of this year. As a result, very little benefit is in the first quarter operating result.", "We expect additional restructuring expenses of approximately $10 million to $15 million as we complete the overall cost reductions and we expect to achieve our targeted run rate by the end of this year. Special items also included a benefit for $45 million for one quarter of the amortization of the reversal of liability associated with the postretirement amendment. We expect each quarter of this year to have a similar amount. ", "The final special item was a $22 million gain related to the sale of nonstrategic property. Unallocated G&A expenses for the first quarter as shown on chart 13 totalled a positive $1 million. The change when compared to the fourth quarter is primarily the result of income from changes in share based compensation which is driven by the change in order in stock price well as a shift from unallocated pension expense to pension credits due to the performance of the pension assets and a change in the discount rate. Unallocated function expenses were also somewhat lower than normal.", "I\u2019ll wrap up with some overall financial comments and I\u2019ll refer you to chart 15 for these comments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $780 million down from the $835 million at yearend. The first quarter is typically our lowest cash generation quarter due to the seasonal build in working capital as well as lower housing market activity. Cash flow from operations was $109 million which included income tax related receipts of approximately $60 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $65 million and we expect total expenditure for the year of approximately 400 million. Our long term debt was unchanged from yearend and we have not maturities until 2017.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Patty. I am pleased with our first quarter results as we delivered strong operating performance despite unusually severe winter weather, significantly increased EBITDA from our Longview Timber acquisition and took actions against our commitment to reduce SG&A cost. We are beginning to realize the initial benefits of our operations excellence efforts and I look forward to sharing additional progress with you as the year progresses. We are relentlessly focused everyday on growing a truly company by driving superior operational and financial performance to increase cash flow, grow our dividend, and generate additional shareholder value.", "With that comment, I think, we will open it for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research Group.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Thank you. Congratulations on a very good quarter. You ended the first quarter with 780 million of cash and I believe you\u2019re going to have some more cash coming in as part of the TRI Pointe acquisition as well. Can you give a sense as to what you think is the necessary or the right amount of cash from a longer term basis to run the business that you would tend to want to have recognizing where the first quarter might be different than a different quarter? What order or magnitude? What type of cash level do you typically like have to run the company?", "Patty Bedient", "Good morning, Mark. It\u2019s Patty and I\u2019ll take that one. I think as we think about the cash balance, there are a number of considerations to think about. One of course is where we are in the cycle and we believe we are still in the early innings of the homebuilding recovery, but also what we need for our working capital to support the increased activity. ", "The other thing of course is what is the level of liquidity? And we have very good liquidity. One of the things I didn\u2019t mention was that we have our line of credit for $1 billion that we have no borrowings outstanding. So as we look at cash going forward, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate that we would need the level of cash that would be indicated by the $780 million that you\u2019ve referenced at the end of the first quarter as well as additional receipts from the TRI Pointe acquisition.", "The other thing that we will not have going forward of course is the cash generated from income from WRECO, so that\u2019s the other offset to that. So a lot of things that go into that number and so those are the things that we are looking at in terms of what is the best use of that cash going forward to build shareholder value.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA", "Thank you. Doyle, as we think about operational excellence, should we expect there to be any meaningful impact in your Timber rotations or your harvesting plants in general. Obviously Longview has caused me to have some optimization, but if we leave Longview out of it, is there a meaningful effort that\u2019s going to change in the way you\u2019re managing your Timberlands?", "Doyle Simons", " ", "Mark, we\u2019re applying our operational excellence within lands across our entire company including Timberland both the Legacy Timberland as well as the Columbia Timberland what we called Columbia Longview Timberland. And just as an example Mark, I would say that in this quarter while we clearly benefited from the higher volume and prices in the quarter, part of the strong quarter in Timberland was a result of the operational excellence initiative that we have put in place specifically in logging and trucking cost improvement and merchandising. And also making sure we get the right log to the right customer to capture the full value. ", "So we\u2019re looking across through an operational excellence lens across all of our businesses including Timberland. And while I can\u2019t speak specifically to the exact impact on the harvesting and that type of thing, I can tell you we have already started to see improvement in our timberland operation as a result of our operational excellence initiatives and a little bit of that showed up in the first quarter.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and just one thing. It sounds like you\u2019re going to see the log shift towards China away from Japan a little bit overall year-over-year. What\u2019s happening to the China margins? You\u2019ve talked about improvement in some of your China margins in past quarters. Is this shift going to push the overall margin down or are we seeing China pick up?", "Patty Bedient", "So, Mark, this is Patty. As we think about China, the difference in margins I would say come from some softening in Japan, so as you know, a grade mix that goes to Japan is a little richer grade mix. That also in terms of their competition for that log goes into the overall volume that goes into Asia. So we expect the China margins will see some pressure in terms of just the overall amount and I think I referenced that in our outlook comments, but from a perspective of overall demand from China, we believe that will continue to stay strong. And then as we go forward and get more of the pickup in housing domestically, that domestic log, saw log competes with the China demand, so those two will put tension on each other in terms of the pricing.", "", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merill Lynch.", "George Staphos - Bank of America Merill Lynch", "Thanks. Hi guys, good morning. Congratulations on the progress. I guess first question on RICO, what would be your interpretation for us in terms of the fact that you do have closings now picking up and cancellations down. And in particular, are you seeing, Doyle, a pick-up in the first time home buyer in the market because that seems to be what's been missing here in the cycle, in terms of extending it going forward?", "Doyle Simons", "George, I agree with you. I think that is what's been missing and for this housing to get back to the 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 level that we've seen historically, we're going to need to see the first time home buyer start to gain some traction. I think we're starting to see a little bit of that, but there's still some challenges in the mortgage market regarding loan availability and the amount that's required to be put down and just the credit scores that are currently required. ", "Encouragingly I think we're starting to see a little bit of loosening of some of those standards which I think is healthy and that will prompt more first time home buyers into the marketplace. So we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to start to see more and more first time home buyers stepping into the market and we think that's what's going to take this housing starts to the next level.", "Patricia Bedient", "Yeah, George, kind of the other things that is just holding back a little bit that first time home builder or buyer is the fact that the FHA limits have also been reduced somewhat, so I think that's putting a little pressure on that marketplace as well, but as Doyle said overall, as we look forward for housing, we're optimistic about what will happen for the rest of 2014.", "George Staphos - Bank of America Merill Lynch", "Patty, the FHA limits has been a much discussed topic and it's a good thing you are bringing it up. Do you think that that won't be a burden or an in pediment for a year or do you think if you're through a quarter or two down the road, we should have already had the impact of that in terms of demand?", "Doyle Simons", "Well, I think it's yet to be seen and I think it's one factor in the first time home buyer. I think the other pieces of the overall mortgage availability, as well as just what's happening with consumer confidence and economic activity overall. So, I think if that continues to improve even slowly, but subtly that will overcome some of that pressure that comes from the FHA limits.", "George Staphos - Bank of America Merill Lynch", "Thanks. My last question and I'll turn it over. Within EWP, can you comment or maybe provide a little bit more granularity on why you feel you're on target with some of your operational improvement programs. And Doyle you mentioned you expect or Patty mentioned you expect sales realizations to be up, I guess marginally in the quarter. Is that because of the tail effect from last year or is that because there's some new price increases in the market? Thanks. And good luck in the quarter.", "Doyle Simons", "Good question, George. And on ELP specifically, what we saw in the quarter was we had some start-up costs as we mentioned associated with our evergreen, Alabama mill. We also had some weather impacts in the quarter. We, like I said, remain confident that we're going to increase the earnings in that business by $30 to $40 million EBITDA in 2014 compared with 2013. We also to your point are encouraged and confident, we're going to see some price increases and are already starting to see those in the second quarter versus the first quarter, some of that due to mix, but some of that due to just overall improvement in prices as we move into the stronger spring seasonal period.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "I guess before I ask my question, Patty, just want to acknowledge the retirement best of luck and I guess we'll have you for another quarter on the call, but thanks for all your help.", "Patricia Bedient", "Thank you.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "I guess just starting with timber, results were higher than what you might have suggested last quarter and I'm just wondering what surprised you in the quarter, where the upside came from relative to what you might have expected?", "Doyle Simons", "Gail, we were encouraged by our results in our timberlands business in the first quarter and I would basically point to three things. One thing was we clearly had higher prices as prices strengthened in the quarter versus the fourth quarter that resulted -- as a result we had a little bit higher volumes to capitalize on those higher prices in the quarter. ", "The second thing is as I mentioned earlier, we had some benefit from our operational excellence initiatives, specifically in some cost improvement on logging and trucking, and also did a good job of merchandising and what I mean by that as I mentioned earlier is getting the right log to the right customer at the right time to fully maximize the value. ", "And then third and importantly, we saw a really nice improvement from our Longview acquisition in the quarter. As I mentioned or as we mentioned, that was up approximately $18 million from the prior quarter. We saw about 6 million of synergy benefit or let me put it this way, in terms of the synergies from Columbia, we are at a run rate as of the first quarter about 6 million a quarter, which would translate into about $24 million of synergy benefits on an annual basis. And as you know that\u2019s well ahead of our original target of 20 million in synergy. So those are the three buckets that contributed to the Timberlands improvement in the quarter versus the prior quarter and maybe versus some expectations.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay and I don\u2019t suppose you could quantify the operating excellence contribution there?", "Doyle Simons", "As we\u2019ve said before, Gail, we will quantify that on an annual basis because it will be lumpy. But, I will tell you, it did have an impact in -- a significant impact, I guess, it depends on how you define significant, but it did have an impact on the bottom line in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "And can you talk about maybe the weather impact in the quarter both potentially, if you can quantify what it might have done to you and just maybe taking a step back and what it might mean for the market for instance, lumber seems to have accrued up in Canada. Are you starting to see that come back? So if you could just maybe talk about both, I guess, the financial impact and direct impact as well as how you think it might impact some of the markets as everything unfolds in the second quarter?", "Doyle Simons", "Sure, so let me start off by saying I was proud, we were proud the way our people managed through the tough weather conditions in the quarter. As you know, there was a lot going on. In terms of quantifying the impact, its differential by business as you would expect, but I would say in Timberlands, it was minimal. In our Wood Products business if you look across our Wood Products businesses, the impact by business was somewhere in the $2 to $5 million range per business. ", "This had to do with things like closures, and lumber for example, we lost 27 days due to closures and distribution. We lost over 50 days due to weather closures. In addition, we had slow backs, as you know when you have frozen logs in a saw mill you can\u2019t run as fast, so that was part of the issue. We had transportation issues in Canada and in the US. And we even had a couple of mills for a short period of time specifically in one of our OSB Mills we're able to get logs to the mill to run. So those were some of the challenges that we had. Again, I thought our people did a really nice job of managing through that in our Wood Products business.", "And then in our Cellulose Fibers business, Gail, the impact there from weather was approximately $4 million, and that was primarily due to higher energy cost and some railcar availability specifically regarding our Grand Prairie Mill. ", "In terms of going forward, most of these issues we think are behind us. There we still have transportation challenges that we'll work through specifically in Canada as you talked about, but all-in all we think most of it's behind us and we\u2019ll be able to work through it as we move through the second quarter.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just from the market perspective any worries that production build up in Canada as the transport issues unwind will have an impact on the market, is that why you\u2019re looking for fairly muted lumber prices in the quarter?", "Patty Bedient", "So, Gail, I think as we referenced, our realizations thus far in the quarter were softer. I think that likely part of that is due to that issue, but I think now we see them starting to stabilize and think they will move up from this point. So, I think we\u2019ll work through that nicely. Again, it is dependent upon how housing activity comes back, but the underlying fundamentals for housing and now with the improved weather, things look good at this point.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just one last question, can you talk about, I guess, looking at WRICO and the activity you\u2019re seeing there and as it suggests for housing activity more broadly, are you seeing, can you kind of quantify and give examples of any seasonal pick up you\u2019re seeing and also you operate in regions that would have been affected by weather but also ones that probably weren\u2019t? And did you note a difference in trend beyond just the underlying market fundamentals that gives you confidence, some of the sluggishness in housing or a lot of the sluggishness in housing in the first quarter was weather related versus something else?", "Patty Bedient", "Sure. I think there are a couple of things as we look at our own markets. If you think about our Winchester subsidiary, which is in the Washington D.C. area was really hammered by weather, even the first part of the second quarter hammered by weather, so it\u2019s a little tough to see exactly the impact that weather had, how much of it, but it was significant and we\u2019re starting to see that now come back around. ", "I think the other in the first quarter markets that were a little rougher were not surprisingly those that were potentially a little overheated in the prior year and I would reference Phoenix and Las Vegas there. Phoenix is now stabilizing as well so that\u2019s a good thing, California, Los Angeles is doing well and here in the Puget Sound of course, the market did not go down as far as some of the other markets that we had. ", "Texas also continues to remain strong, so I think again as we look forward, a lot of that's behind us, I think the other thing that has put a little bit of a dampening effect on the marketplace is sort of a good news bad news, we had some pretty significant price increases over the course of last year and I think that has slowed that a little bit, so we don't have as many closings as we'd like but they're closing at higher prices, so one sort of helps to offset the other one, but as I said before, we are much more excited now about homebuilding as we look forward with this really harsh weather in so many geographies behind us. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. ", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "", "Can you remind us how much incremental capacity the Evergreen, Alabama plant will add to the EWP business and where your utilization rates will be once that plant starts up? ", "Patty Bedient", "", "You know, in Evergreen, which is, it has started up now and it will be shipping product the first of May, it produces two products primarily, I-joist and microlam and we have about 61 million Lineal feet would be the capacity that we would note for I-joist and about 4 million cubic feet for microlam solid sections. ", "In terms of its moving into commercial production now, it won't be operating at full capacity to start with as we move that product into the marketplace. I think overall if we were to discount the Evergreen mill we're operating across that part of the business in engineered wood at around 70% but it's very differential by product line. For example, our microlam product is operating at very, very high operating rates. That's one of the reasons that we're excited about having the availability from Evergreen coming online. ", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "", "Appreciate that detail, Patty and then pulp, there's been recent price erosion on the softwood side in China even though inventory seems to be in pretty good shape. Do you have any thoughts on why we've seen prices move lower in China and any visibility into the pulp price environment in China over next couple of months? ", "Patty Bedient", "", "Well I think as we look at one of the things that puts pressure on paper grade softwood is of course the additional hardwood capacity that is coming online, but China does need softwood to go with the hardwood so I think even though prices may soften here later that we still are feeling good about pricing overall moving up in the second quarter and that would certainly include our fluff pulp price going up as well. ", "Doyle Simons", "", "Yes, Alex if you look at the -- as we mentioned first quarter and fourth quarter clearly fluff prices were up and we anticipate that trend will continue into the second quarter and part of that has been the disruption in the overall supply side of the equation due to the weather but we do think that's going to carryover clearly into the second quarter overall. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Thanks very much, good morning. Just a couple questions on Timberlands exports. My understanding is Chinese log and lumber inventories are actually pretty high right now. I guess a question is are you seeing the same thing and then just on your reference to the consumption tax increase in Japan and the slower refile there. Can you quantify that? Do you expect that down 5-10% in Q2? ", "Doyle Simons", "", "From the Chinese perspective, I think inventories did build a little bit during the Lunar New Year period as I referenced in my comments. We anticipate as that gets behind us that demand will in fact continue to increase in China and that will be helpful in decreasing the overall log inventories in China. ", "In terms of Japan, if you look at it historically when there's been a change to the consumption tax, you normally see a little bit of pre-buying and then you see a little bit of weakness as it goes in and then stabilization. And it's hard to tell exactly how that's going to play out this time but our guess is it's going to be a similar type pattern. We probably did see a little bit of pre buying, now we're in the period where there may be a little bit of weakness due to the adjustment to the consumption tax, but long term, we continue to be very encouraged by the demand out of Japan.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then just on operational excellence, it looks like you're getting some traction there. Just wondering, if you're able to share at some point in the future your targets, your timing and sort of the CapEx required to get where you want to get to?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. So let me talk generally about OpEx across all of our businesses and I would tell you we're encouraged by the progress that we've made against the targets that we laid out in December. As we previously said we will quantify the benefits on an annual basis but let me give just a little bit of color directionally on some of the benefits that we're starting to see. I already hit on Timberlands a little bit, but clearly part of our good quarter in Timberlands was a result of our operational excellence initiatives. And specifically, as I mentioned earlier regarding cost improvement on logging and trucking and also on merchandising, again making sure we get the right log to the right spot. ", "In terms of lumber, our manufacturing costs were lower than the prior quarter. That as you know is the key focus of our operational excellence efforts. I will tell you that was somewhat hampered in quarter by weather, but I can tell you plans are in place to start to really capture the benefits from our efforts there in the second quarter and we're confident we'll see the benefit of that in the second quarter and going forward.", "And our OSB business, the reliability, was a challenge our key focus areas, it\u2019s improving our reliability again as we laid out on December 17th, that was challenged during the quarter, due to weather but we start to see an improvement late in the quarter and that improvements continued into the second quarter. And then the other initiative there is to improve our mix of high value products or enhanced products and just as an example there, we're starting to make our flooring product at our Hudson Bay mill. ", "In ELP, as I mentioned earlier, we had some weather impacts, but we are confident that we will see the improvements that we've laid out in ELP. And similarly in distribution, where we are there, as I mentioned had over 50 days of closure due to weather in the first quarter, but I can tell you, all of our sites has completed, an extensive analysis of the customers, the products lines, pricing, the warehouse cost and delivery cost and I can tell you one by one those sites are turning to profitability and we are encouraged by what we're seeing there.", "In sales Fibers -- we can give you a number of examples of operational excellence but I think the one that I would highlight for the first quarter is we had record production at a number of our mills, despite the very severe winter weather and that's not the case across the board, if you look at what happened in that business overall and when I say in that business, I mean in that industry overall in the quarter, so we did a good job of running those mills, despite the tough weather. And then we talked about SG&A and we're making great progress on our SG&A. I'm confident we're going to get where we need to be. ", "So I think the summary is we're on track. We're working hard on this operational excellence every day. We're starting to see some benefit and much more to come and we'll like I said we will update you on an annual basis on exactly where we are versus the targets that we laid out on December 17th.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Just two quick questions. First of all, can you just tell us what criteria would determine whether a split or a spin is preferable?", "Patricia Bedient", "Sure, Steve. As we think about those, we think about the spin as being like a special dividend and the split is more akin to a share repurchase. So if you think about the criteria that you would use for each of those. In addition, one of the things that we look at when we look at the spin versus the split is, of course, in the spin you're just issuing the shares pro-rata to the existing Weyerhaeuser shareholder base. In a split, shareholders are given a choice to exchange their Weyerhaeuser shares for the shares of what we think is a very strong home builder going forward. So the split gives the investor base the opportunity to choose which one. And we think that it has the added advantage of then placing the stock with its more -- its natural investor base. Whereas there may be some people who are Weyerhaeuser shareholders who would say I don't really want to own homebuilding long-term, I want more of a forest products exposure, and so it really is the fact that one is simpler, certainly the spin is much simpler, and the split though a little more complex, does have the ability to place the stock with more of its investor base and it is the split is what we did in when we did the downtown transaction in 2007, although it is a little more complex to execute, it is something we have done in the past.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "It does make sense I guess to get it in the hands of those who want it. From a tax perspective, is one more advantageous than the other?", "Patty Bedient", "No, there really isn\u2019t any difference from one versus the other.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Okay, thank you for that. And then the second question was you\u2019ve elaborated on why you remain confident in the housing recovery, so can you just tell us how you position the Wood Products business? Is your operating stance predicated on an 18% increase in starts which is the difference between 2013 and the 1.1 million that you expect or is it based on your order filed from week to week?", "Doyle Simons", "Well, I would say it\u2019s both of the above. We clearly are matching our supply with our demand but we\u2019re also as we look forward, we continue to anticipate an improvement in housing as we said. So you factor in all of those equations as you look to the future for our wood products business, but I like the way we\u2019re positioned in our Wood Products business. Our focus as mentioned earlier is just running the capacity that we have better. And we\u2019re starting to make improvements in doing just that. And in terms of our overall, if you look at it, any of our mills that we closed have either been started up so which was evergreen or permanently closed. We do not have any mills sitting idle at this point. And like I said, I like where we\u2019re positioned in Wood Products and think we\u2019re very well positioned to fully capitalize on the continued improvement in housing going forward.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "So you\u2019re ready to serve 1.1 million starts but you\u2019re not going to run for practice, right.", "Doyle Simons", "That is correct.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon.", "Chip Dillon", "Three quick ones. Good morning, Doyle and Patty, and Kathy. And again good luck to you Kathy as you later this year move on into retirement. I wanted to you ask first on the land sales now that we have a reconfigured Timberland business with the Longview properties, is sort of the second quarter, is that an usually high level land sales you would expect going forward? And I know it's erratic or would that represent kind of a normal level?", "Patty Bedient ", " ", "Well, it is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, sort of historically if you can call it seasonality to it. The first quarter is usually a little lower. The second quarter at 20 million does not involve Longview land sales. So, it\u2019s not that activity is not coming as a function of Longview. So I would say that 20 million probably is more on the high side from a quarterly perspective so that would give you a run rate of around 80, but it\u2019s going be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year really based upon the opportunity that we see. So we look to upgrade the portfolio through the land sales because those are for the most part, exchanges that we are doing. So it\u2019s a function of continuing to look for the best opportunity and that\u2019s why you see the lumpiness, we're not trying to hit it a particular target in any one quarter, it\u2019s really opportunistic.", "Chip Dillon", "I see and then I guess the second one is, I know in December that kind of the two sub-businesses within Wood Products had sort of need the improvement, obviously our EWP and distribution, and I was wondering sort of when do you get to a point where they need to show the kind of improvement you expect them to versus maybe making of a decision from those businesses? In other words would that be a couple of years or maybe a year?", "Doyle Simons", "Chip, as we very specifically said on December 17, we anticipate and fully expect both of those businesses or each of those businesses, let me be very clear, each of those businesses to improve EBITDA about $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013. At this point, we remain confident that that\u2019s in fact exactly what\u2019s going to happen and we\u2019re taking a lot of very proactive steps to make sure that is in fact the case. So that\u2019s the timeline we\u2019ve played out and that\u2019s the timeline we\u2019re committed to.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay, very clear, and one quick one for Patty. The interest expense for the first quarter at 83 million was a little less than we thought, is that a good run rate to use for that the rest of year assuming nothing big -- well forgetting the -- even with split off, would you assume not to change much?", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, I think that that should probably be a pretty good. That is net of capitalized interest. So a few million can change quarter-to-quarter depending upon what projects we\u2019re doing, but there shouldn\u2019t be anything particularly different in that number going forward.", "", "Operator", "", "Your final question will come from the line of Colin Ming, with Raymond James.", "", "Colin Ming - Raymond James", "", "Hey, good morning, just real quick, going back to the question about really the cash balance, in the past you guys have talked about using some of your cash position to continue to grow that Timberland portfolio. Can you maybe just update us on what you\u2019re seeing from your perspective on the acquisition environment and are there, any other deals you guys are looking at on that front.", "Doyle Simons", "", "I would just say, we are constantly looking at opportunities to grow our Timberland base, now we will as we have historically we\u2019ll be very disciplined in doing that and we\u2019re not going to grow just for the sake of growing, if we can find acquisition opportunities like the Longview acquisition where we can drive value for shareholders that\u2019s something we will pursue going forward, so, we\u2019re, as we\u2019ve have been historically and we continue to be, we look at lots of different acquisition opportunities but we will be continue to be very disciplined in the way we approach those going forward.", "", "Colin Ming \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, thanks Doyle, and then Patty maybe can you just remind us are there any sort of restrictions tied to the proceeds coming from WRECO, the $700 million plus or minus, just given the way that the homebuilder unit was in the TRS and then just the nature of the transaction, are there going to be any near term restrictions related to that incoming cash?", "Patty Bedient", "", "Yes, Colin as you think about that cash, it is unrestricted but as you referenced, it is coming into the TRS, so there are no additional restrictions as a result of it coming from the home building business other than the fact that would be the same as any other cash that is in the TRS in terms of moving at around between the REIT and the TRS but it is totally unrestricted other than that.", "", "Colin Ming \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, well, can you maybe just remind us like some of the mechanisms to get that, that amount of cash out of the TRS and up to the REIT?", "Patty Bedient", "", "Well one of the things that certainly you can do is dividend cash from the TRS to the REIT, there are limitations as to how much cash can be dividended in any particular year and that\u2019s really a function of the earnings in Timberland business.

Certainly if you want to move cash down you can make a capital contribution, but I think your question is more about moving cash from the TRS up to the REIT, so you can loan it up without restriction, you just have to pay interest income on that down to the TRS.", "", "Colin Ming - Raymond James", "Okay, and then just, you guys referenced in kind of you, I think your 2Q outlook in some of the prepared remarks just about some of the momentum you\u2019re starting to see in the US south as far as log pricing there, can you guys quantify that at all, I mean we\u2019ve kind of heard mixed messages depending upon which specific region you\u2019re in, generally the Gulf south not being as strong but kind of Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas being a little bit stronger, can you just maybe put a little additional color on that, maybe quantify the type of movement you\u2019re seeing in the south.", "Doyle Simons", "", "You know, I would answer that by saying, if you look at 2013, prices in the log prices in the south were up roughly 4%. As we said in our comments and as shown on the slides, prices were up again modestly in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter and what we anticipate is a slow but certain increase in log prices in the south going forward, yes, by quarter by quarter it will vary by region and you\u2019ll see one move up more than the other but overall we are encouraged by the trend that we see and are confident that over time prices will continue to improve in the south as we see housing continue to rebound.", "", "Colin Ming \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, great, congrats on the quarter.", "Doyle Simons", " ", "Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.", "I now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior VP of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.", "Denise Merle", "Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website.", "On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations.", "I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Denise and good morning everyone. Weyerhaeuser delivered a solid earnings performance in the second quarter driven by very strong results in each of our businesses and reflecting our employees\u2019 relentless focus on operational excellence.", "This morning we reported second quarter net earnings of $280 million or $0.47 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $2 billion. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we earned $234 million or $0.40 per diluted share. This is an increase of nearly 65% compared with the first quarter and almost 30% compared with one year ago.", "Special items in the quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to the post retirement health plan and restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions.", "Earnings associated with Weyerhaeuser real-estate company RICO are being reported as discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture of that business on July 7. I would like to thank the Weyerhaeuser and RICO employees for their hard work in completing this transaction.", "As part of the RICO transaction, we retired nearly 59 million common shares worth over $1.9 billion. These retirements which will be reflected in our third quarter share count more than offset the common shares issued in conjunction with last year\u2019s Longview Timber acquisition.", "I will begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about market conditions. Severe winter weather earlier this year dampened the start of the spring building season and the U.S. housing market recovery remained sluggish with total housing start up only 6% in the first half of 2014 compared with 2013.", "Rising employment and strong consumer confidence support our expectation of further housing market improvements. However, we have lowered our 2014 housing outlook as a result of the weaker market during the first half of the year and are now planning for between 1 million and 1.1 million starts.", "The bottom line is we believe that residential housing markets will continue to improve but at a slower rate than it had been previously anticipated.", "Let me now turn to our business segments starting with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands posted another outstanding quarter contributing $170 million to earnings. In the West, we experienced steady demand in our domestic markets, our realizations from Western domestic logs declined.", "Although overall Chinese demand softened somewhat during the quarter as a result of elevated inventory to support our sales volumes to our customers increased compared with the first quarter and our pricing remained comparable. As anticipated, Japanese demand weakened in the second quarter due to the effect of the increased consumption tax.", "Western logging and road cost increased seasonally as we log our higher elevations in the summer months when snow is not present. We remain extremely pleased with the performance of our Longview Timber acquisition which contributed $51 of EBITDA in the quarter.", "In the South, sea harvest volumes declined due to wet weather and log prices rose by approximately 1% compared with the first quarter. Second quarter also included $24 million from dispositions of non-strategic Timberlands an increase of $20 million compared with the first quarter.", "The Timberlands segment continues to benefit from operational excellence initiatives including reduction and stomp to customer logging cost and increased extraction of export quality logs.", "Wood products charts 6 and 7, wood products earned $102 million in the second quarter, an improvement of nearly 60% compared with the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $132 million compared with $93 million in the first quarter and sales volumes increased seasonally across all our product lines.", "In lumber, EBITDA improved by $9 million as high sales volumes due to improved weather and seasonality were partially offset by lower average price realizations. Lumber manufacturing costs continued to decline as a result of our operational excellence initiative which are focused on lowering our costs net of logs.", "In OSB, EBITDA was flat as lower realizations were offset by growth and enhanced products and improved productivity. Results for engineered wood products improved significantly compared with first quarter as EBITDA increased nearly fourfold to $30 million.", "Sales volumes increased more than 25% for solid section products and nearly 40% for TGI Joists, and average realizations for both products rose slightly.", "The business also benefited from lower manufacturing costs compared with the prior quarter as a result of operational excellence initiatives and the successful ramp-up of the evergreen Alabama mill.", "Our distribution business reported EBITDA of $3 million in the second quarter, an improvement of $8 million. The business remains focused on lowering cost and improving sales and margins. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress that our engineered wood products and distribution businesses made against their operational excellence targets in the quarter.", "Cellulose fibers, chart 8 and 9, cellulose fibers earned $91 million, a substantial increased compared with $54 million in the first quarter. Fluff realizations were strong and maintenance cost declined due to fewer schedule maintenance outage dates. The business had another excellent quarter operationally and set a year-to-date record for productivity.", "Discontinued operations, chart 11. As I indicated in my opening remarks, results from our real-estate business are now reported as discontinued operations. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of $22 million from discontinued operations compared with $10 million in the first quarter. The improvement was primarily due to a seasonal increase in home closings.", "At the end of the second quarter, we clearly identified all planned cost reductions associated with our SG&A initiative. Implementation is ongoing and we incurred an additional $6 million of restructuring charges in the quarter relating to this initiative. I\u2019m highly confident we will reach our $75 million run rate reduction target by the end of the year.", "I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our third quarter outlook.", "Patty Bedient", "Thanks Doyle, and good morning everybody. The housing recovery thus far in 2014 has been slower than anticipated. However, this week\u2019s better than expected forecast on GDP growth for the remainder of the year was welcome news.", "The outlook for the third quarter earnings is summarized on chart 12, and I\u2019ll begin my comments with Timberlands.", "In the west, export log realizations and volumes are expected to decline as a result of normal seasonal softening. The Japan market is normally weaker during the summer months as a result of rainy weather. In addition to the normal seasonality, the Japanese lumber market has been adversely affected by the implementation of the consumption tax increase. High log inventories at Chinese courts will also likely result in lower demand and prices.", "Domestic log markets are anticipated to be weaker as well during the third quarter. Softer export markets combined with the increased supply of logs that typically come to market during the third quarter from the smaller non-industrial private land owners who do not have adequate road systems to harvest on year round basis are expected to exert downward pressure on prices.", "As a result in anticipation of the softer markets in the third quarter, we intentionally accelerated harvest into the first half of this year. For these reasons, we anticipate a lower fee harvest in the west in the third quarter compared to the second.", "Supply constraints as a result of fire related logging restrictions could result in some upward price pressure in certain markets especially in Oregon. In the third quarter we also expect seasonal increases in western road costs.", "In the south, we expect that fee harvest will increase as some harvest in the second quarter was delayed due to wet weather. In addition, we typically perform more of our spending activity on the third quarter, which increases volumes and lowers the average realizations due to mix. We are also anticipating higher cost due to seasonal increase in silvicultural activities.", "Earnings from non-strategic land sales should also decrease compared to the higher levels of the second quarter. We expect that overall earnings in our Timberland segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second but comparable to the third quarter of last year.", "In wood products, we expect that sales realizations will be down slightly for both lumber and OSB with relatively consistent volumes. Sales realizations for engineered lumber will be up as a result of price increases that were effective as of the beginning of this quarter.", "Engineered lumber volumes could be somewhat lower due to orders that may have been called forward into the second quarter as a result of the announced price increase.", "Log cost in the west should decrease in the quarter and also in Canada to a larger extent. Housing demand has been more muted than expected, however our inventories continue to be in great shape across our system. And our continued focus on cost reduction and operating efficiencies continues to benefit all businesses. We expect that earnings in the third quarter in the wood product segment will be comparable to the second quarter.", "In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood inventories as beginning of this quarter were in good shape at a couple of days below normal. We do see some softening in paper grade especially into China and we expect that inventory levels will return to normal during the quarter.", "Fluff demand globally remains healthy and our order books are full. The most significant change in our Cellulose Fibers business in the third quarter will be an extended planned outage at our Longview liquid packaging operation. We will be completing a number of capital improvements that have been planned for some time. These include upgrades to the press section, evaporators, digester and head-box.", "The improvements will lower energy and fiber costs and increase the quality of the board and product mix. Although the outage will result in increased maintenance cost, our sales volumes will be only somewhat lower as we have been building inventory in anticipation of this outage and we have had excellent year-to-date operating reliability.", "In addition to the liquid packaging outage, we will also have increased plan maintenance in our port mill system compared to the second quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in our sale of fiber segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and more comparable to the first quarter of this year.", "Our real-estate results have been restated for all periods to show RICO operations has discontinued. At the end of the second quarter, our balance sheet was grossed up for funds RICO borrowed in anticipation of the transaction. Both the cash and the debt are included in discontinued operations as of June 30 and were eliminated after the end of the quarter when the divestiture was completed.", "As previously announced, we closed the divestiture on July 7. As a result, our share count was reduced by approximately 59 million shares bringing our current share count to just under 530 million. In addition, we received over $700 million in cash. Our third quarter results will show a gain on the divestiture of approximately $1 billion.", "Chart 10 summarizes the unallocated items for the second quarter. In the third quarter we expect that we will once again have a special item for the pretax gain of approximately $45 million related to an earlier post retirement health plan amendment which we are amortizing ratably over the year.", "Other ongoing unallocated items are difficult to forecast, as they are driven by changes in foreign exchange, share price and inventory levels.", "Chart 13 summarizes certain financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $845 million, an increase of almost $70 million. There was no change to our long-term debt of just under $4.9 billion and we have no maturities until 2017.", "As of the end of the second quarter, we had year-to-date capital expenditures including reforestation of $159 million and we still expect the total for the year to approximate $400 million.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Patty. Through the RICO divestiture and Longview Timber acquisition we have positioned Weyerhaeuser as a focused force products company with a productive asset base and significant runway for earnings growth and cash generation.", "Our strong second quarter results reflect our employee\u2019s commitment to operational excellence. And we remain focused on driving superior returns from our assets to generate value for our shareholders. Thank you.", "And now I would like to open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi", "Good morning.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Patty Bedient", "Good morning.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi", "I had a couple of questions in Wood Products. In engineered wood products it looks like you\u2019ve got $20 million of EBITDA improvement year-to-date. And I believe that you had the $30 million to $40 million target for the year. And given the progress thus far, do you feel like maybe you\u2019ll be at the top end of that range?", "Is there maybe potential upside to that target? And then, also for the three main businesses within wood products, I was wondering if you could share what your operating rates were in the quarter?", "Doyle Simons", "So, let\u2019s start with your first question and in our ELP business, Anthony, we were very encouraged by the progress we made in the quarter. As you referenced, we went from $8 million of EBITDA to $30 million, from $8 million of EBITDA in the first quarter to $30 million of EBITDA in the second quarter.", "Also as you referenced, our commitment was to improve EBITDA in that business by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013. And we think we\u2019re well on the way to doing that, that\u2019s the commitment we\u2019re going to work to get as much earnings out of that business as we can get in 2014. And like I said, we\u2019re encouraged about the progress we made to date.", "In terms of operating rates, if you will start with lumber, lumber operating rates were in the low 90%. OSB, was approximately 90% and then ELP overall and as you know that the mixture of products was in mid-70s in terms of operating rates for that business.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just a follow-up maybe on Cellulose Fibers. The project in liquid packaging board, is that going to result in any material increase in capacity or is it just a cost measure?", "Patty Bedient", "Anthony, the most important part of that project is cost reduction and quality improvement. We will get some increased capacity maybe in the around 10% range but that project really was done to lower our energy and our fiber cost and as I said improved the product quality.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you. Just following up a little bit on the liquid packaging and the Cellulose Fibers, can you give us a sense as to roughly how much the outages, are going to impact the third quarter relative to the second quarter?", "Doyle Simons", "Sure Mark. As we indicated in the comments, we anticipate earnings will be lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter in Cellulose Fiber. And that is primarily if not wholly driven by the outages.", "Just to quantify it a little bit, we think the Longview liquid packaging outage will result in roughly $30 million of the impact. And as we also said we have additional outages compared to the prior quarter in our port mills. And that would be another $5 million to $10 million impact on the third quarter versus the second quarter.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Great. And then, is it fair to say that when you come out of it the other end, you not only get that back but presumably from the project, picking the liquid packaging, you hopefully have even higher earnings power assuming pricing and markets are similar. And any way to give us a feel for the type of returns or earning enhancement that you might get from the project?", "Doyle Simons", "Well, as Patty alluded to Mark, the project will do three things, improve quality, lower cost and then have roughly 10%, over time it will take a little bit time to get there but 10% improvement in production. So, all those things will factor in. We won\u2019t provide a specific number but clearly the reason for doing that project is to drive additional earnings in cash out of our liquid packaging board operation.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thank you and congratulations for the evidence of continued operational improvement.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Yes, good morning Doyle and congratulations on a great quarter.", "Doyle Simons", "Thanks Chip.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "I wanted to ask you about distribution, I know that it seemed like in the first quarter hadn\u2019t really turned much of a quarter but on the numbers I see here, it looks like you went from something like $16 million EBITDA loss from the first half of \u201813 to $2 million loss in the first half of \u201814.", "So, it may not be \u2013 it may not have arrived yet, but it looks like if the needle is moving in the right direction, do you still think you\u2019ll get to your goals for the year or have your feelings about the business changed any in the last three to six months?", "Doyle Simons", "So, we\u2019re very encouraged about the progress we\u2019ve made in distribution Chip. And as you will recall, the objective there is to improve earnings about $30 million to $40 million. In that business versus 2013, we think we\u2019re absolutely on track to do that. I can tell you there is a real focus on continuing to grow profitable share, making sure our cost are at the target levels.", "And I\u2019ll just tell you we\u2019re encouraged as now more than half of our sites are in fact profitable and we see more and more of those becoming profitable as we move forward. So again very \u2013 lots of work to do as you mentioned but very encouraged by the progress that\u2019s been made over the past couple of quarters.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Okay. And then on the $1 billion gain on RICO, is the early tax impact on that that we should anticipate in the third quarter?", "Patty Bedient", "No Chip, that transaction as we talked about was done in a reverse more structure. And that is one of the benefits of that structure is there is a tax on that gain.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "I see, and then lastly, just on the dividend at this point, I would imagine with $700 million plus coming in from RICO and with the strong results and I know the third quarter is not going to be quite a repeat. But with the lower share count, is that something that you guys are thinking about in the near-term in terms of bringing?", "Doyle Simons", "So, Chip, as we previously disclosed, we\u2019re going to be visiting with our board in mid-August regarding the dividend, potentially use of cash proceeds and those types of things. Just to remind you and everybody else, as we think about capital allocation and what our financial priorities are, as you know, first and foremost is returning cash to shareholders primarily through a growing dividend but also about share repurchase where appropriate.", "Second, is investing our business to high return projects. And then, just as you heard on sale this morning, then improved cost structure and our margin and of course we\u2019ll also look for opportunities to grow our business through value creating acquisitions. Again, an example there would be Longview.", "And then, finally, making sure we maintain the appropriate capital structure. And as you know we\u2019re in good shape on that front. So that\u2019s the way we think about it and again we\u2019ll read back to you in mid-August.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Thank you.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Hi, good morning.", "Patty Bedient", "Good morning, Gail.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Gail.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Maybe going back to engineered wood for a little bit, the volume growth that you had relative to the comments about housing maybe not picking up as quickly as you thought and given how much engineered wood is driven by housing. I mean, what do you think of your volumes, were you picking up share, was there an inventory build or do you think that volume has actually been used?", "Doyle Simons", "I think there are a couple of things that were happening. Or I\u2019m guessing there were a couple of things that were happening there. I think first as we mentioned Gail, there is a price increase going into effect, and first is third quarter. So, I think there might have been some pull forward in terms of buying in the second quarter versus the third quarter. So I think that\u2019s part of the equation.", "I will also tell you as I mentioned earlier, we had a very focused sales effort in that business and I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making there. So, I think our sales folks did a really good job of growing profitable share in that business in the second quarter as well.", "Patty Bedient", "And Gail, as Doyle referenced in his remarks, we did bring up the ever green Alabama facility so all of our engineered wood products facilities now are operating. And so that came up starting shipping product in May so we\u2019ll have it for the full quarter in the third quarter.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And going, and looking at Cellulose Fiber, was there anything in the second quarter result that you wouldn\u2019t view as sustainable, I mean, I was wondering, it is your best quarter since 2011, pricing reported didn\u2019t move dramatically. I\u2019m just wondering, kind of what you think of that upside?", "Patty Bedient", "Well, probably the thing that drove the upside the most was just outstanding operational performance across the Cellulose Fibers system. And I think that all of the hard work that they\u2019ve been doing is paying off and I would look to that being sustainable and repeatable as we go forward.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And looking at the Japanese market, I guess what trends did you see moving through the quarter obviously the tax went up at the start of the quarter? Were things still getting worse or they\u2019re stable, just how do you see that market?", "Patty Bedient", "Are you talking primarily on logs?", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "The logs market, yes.", "Patty Bedient", "So, we had thought that it would be impacted we started to see some impact in the second quarter and that continued into the third quarter. It\u2019s a little difficult to tell for sure because as I mentioned, the third quarter is normally seasonally weaker. But I think the latest news that we\u2019ve heard just earlier this week was that the Japanese government is thinking that the impact of the consumption task, now this is broadly was not as significant as many once thought. And that it is starting to come up and they see more activity towards the second half of the year. But we\u2019ll have to see. But certainly it is softer in the third quarter.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And just one last question, your Timberlands guidance for the quarter, can you give the sense of what type of land sale activity might be incorporated in that?", "Doyle Simons", "So, share it.", "Patty Bedient", "It\u2019s about \u2013 it will be lower than the second quarter as we mentioned, it will probably be somewhere around $8 million to $10 million lower than the second quarter.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning everyone.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning Alex.", "Patty Bedient", "Good morning.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Couple of questions, starting off, engineered wood products. Can you put a little bit more meat around how much you think pre-buy may have contributed to the volume number in the second quarter? I guess we\u2019re now through July kind of looking at how the divine trends were in EWP in July. Does that sort of give you any incremental insight into how much pre-buy there was in the second quarter?", "Doyle Simons", "Well, it is always difficult to assess pre-buy, I would tell you our activity in the month of July continued to be good. So, I would tell you there are some \u2013 there clearly was some pre-buy in the month, in the second quarter. But we didn\u2019t see just a dramatic fall-off in July so we continue to be encouraged by those markets and our sales efforts in those markets.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful Doyle. And then, when you talk about share, so taking share in the EWP, is that again just traditional lumber or would that be against other players in the EWP market?", "Doyle Simons", "And again, it\u2019s hard to know exactly what happens on shares because we don\u2019t see all the different information. But really what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about profitable growth is just growing the ELP business overall. And there are some coming out of saw logs maybe but that\u2019s not specifically what we\u2019re talking \u2013 when I say I didn\u2019t mean all of it, some of it coming out of lumber, possibly but that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re referring to.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, understood. And then, just one last one, Patty, on the corporate line, just from a modeling perspective, so, is it really just zero to minus 5 an then everything else is kind of noise around like you said currency and inventories and some of the other things as well on that line?", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, Alex, as I mentioned, it is difficult to forecast. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why when we put this information together we\u2019ve started putting that chart 10 together for you just so you can see what it looks like in the number of things that move around. So, if for us, the foreign exchange really is a function of the Canadian exchange rate. So as that moves, our share based comp certainly you can track that with the stock price.", "And then, there are just a whole lot of other stuff that goes in there. This quarter, and as we go forward, the other thing that we are focused on is lowering our G&A but we will have some costs on a go forward basis that were historically allocated to the RICO business. And we are focused on making those costs lower as well. But you may see some choppiness as a result of that as we work through the G&A cost.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, got you. All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Patty Bedient", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning, Doyle, good morning, Patty.", "Patty Bedient", "Good morning, Mark.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning Mark. Good to hear you.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Good to be here. I wondered if you guys could talk a little bit about just this shift that we\u2019ve seen over the last year and where your log exports are going because it\u2019s been a pretty marked drop off in the proportion of the volume that goes to Japan and about a 20% to 40% in terms of the growth in what\u2019s going to China?", "Patty Bedient", "Sure Mark. It really is a function of not Japan getting smaller but the China market growing. And so, as you think about the percentage of the pie to those markets, it moves around. What we\u2019re really focused on is growing the pie, and Japan continues to be an extremely good market and important market to us. But what\u2019s moving that really is more growth in the China market in terms of incremental growth.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "And Patty, does that, should that change sort of your average just realization in your export log prices, because my understanding is always that China doesn\u2019t buy as high priced of log as what goes into the Japanese market?", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, that\u2019s fair Mark. From a mixed perspective, you will see the average realization come down. But you will still see a spread between the specific China log compared to the Japanese log.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Yes. And how would you think about that spread right now?", "Patty Bedient", "It\u2019s closing a little bit but they\u2019re both \u2013 both of them have come down in the quarter as we talked about. So I don\u2019t know that the spread is changing all that much.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Just a couple of other quick ones. Doyle can you talk a little bit about how you would think about both investments and/or acquisitions outside of Timberlands, say in the Wood Products area? And then can you give us a little color on that joint venture you announced with Pioneer?", "Doyle Simons: Okay. In terms of the way we look at acquisition opportunities in wood products, Mark. We will, as we\u2019ve said, we would be interested in potentially growing our wood products business but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined. We\u2019re not going to grow those businesses just for the sake of growing. And if we find one-off opportunities that something we would consider, but our primary focus in our wood products business is we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s just running on what we have better. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing every day.", "Patty Bedient", "Mark, I think you\u2019re referencing the licensing that we did on some of our technology IP international intellectual property. And I think it\u2019s an important recognition of the importance and the strength of our intellectual property. But I will tell you that it\u2019s not a meaningful increase in terms of our quarterly results.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Very good. That\u2019s helpful. Good luck in the second half of the year.", "Patty Bedient", "Thank you.", "Doyle Simons", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Thank you. To follow on Mark\u2019s question, so the market in Asia for logs is moving in the direction that you said last quarter you thought it would. Does that change the way you think about your Timberland mix?", "Over the years, obviously Weyerhaeuser bulked up on higher value species and got rid of a lot of the lower value, Hemlock and other lower value stuff. So, are we likely to see Weyerhaeuser maybe attempt to move that shift back to owning or being more willing to own lower value species in the Pacific Northwest?", "Patty Bedient", "Well, Mark, we are focused primarily on Douglas Fir, that is what our most of our lands are best suited to grow. We do have some Whitewoods as well. And so, as you know, not every acre grows best the same species. So I would say we will continue to have a focus on Douglas Fir but our Whitewoods inventory will be important as well. Although it does come at a lower price point based on the quality.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Okay. And then a second question, you\u2019ve said that you have catch up investing to do, particularly in Wood Products. When do you think you will have caught up? Will that happen this year or next? And what do you think of as normal spending in manufacturing and maintenance, once that catch up is done?", "Doyle Simons", "So, Mark, we\u2019re spending a lot of time working on capital issues currently. We will, as always once we make some decisions for next year, either late this year or early next year we will be passing those on to you.", "It will take more than one year period to get our \u2013 to make the investments in some of our wood product operations that we need to, to get our cost structure to where we want it to be.", "And as you know, that\u2019s the real focus of the investment we\u2019re going to make going forward is to continue to drive down our cost structure in order to fully accomplish the OpEx initiatives that we laid out. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. And as we develop more detail, we will be sharing that with you.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Thanks, hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I guess my first question I wanted to go back to distribution. And Doyle recognizing there were a number of factors that you had mentioned in past, that you were focused on in terms of improving the profitability.", "Were there one or two key things that you did this quarter better as a business than you did first quarter or second quarter last year that drove the swing in profitability? And could you comment to those things?", "Doyle Simons", "Sure, sure George. And it really is, when you step back and look at it, it\u2019s getting the focus where it needs to be and just doing the blocking and tackling better. But just a couple of things that I would highlight is, we set very specific targeted cost levels that we needed to accomplish in our distribution business to get \u2013 start to get earnings to where they needed to be. And we made significant progress towards those target levels in the second quarter.", "And then the other thing I would say is, while we\u2019ve been successful in driving the top-line in that business as I referred, we haven\u2019t always had a focus on driving what I call a profitable share. And I think our folks did a really nice job of growing business that added profit to the bottom line in the quarter. So, those are the two specific things that I would highlight occurred in the quarter.", "Again more work to do but really encouraged about the progress that we\u2019re making in distribution and our folks have done a lot of really good work in that business.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "In terms of the runway, is it going to be more on the cost side or is it going to be more on what you\u2019ve got on the racks and can sell? I mean where do you get the further uplift from here, if you had to pick between those two?", "Doyle Simons", "Normally I\u2019m not ambiguous as you know George. But I would tell you, it\u2019s absolutely both. We have to pull both those levers to get to where we need to get to. So I think there is, opportunities both on the cost side and making sure we get the turns right, making sure we have the right products that our customers need. So lots of levers to pull in that business and we\u2019re going to need to pull everyone (inaudible) we are.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Thanks for that. Doyle, in terms of the Longview board machine, I seem to remember that machine\u2019s maybe had some operating difficulties in the last couple of years. Now clearly you\u2019re going to improve productivity, you\u2019re going to improve cost and you need a little bit of throughput out of this as well.", "But how much of this was driven by the fact that maybe the machine had been a little bit less reliable in terms of quality over the last few years? And can you explain a little more in terms of what was behind that?", "Doyle Simons", "So, let me give my view point of probably little more short time and I\u2019ll let Patty expand on it. But again, I\u2019m just telling you, this facility has run really well, and Patty mentioned in her comments, it\u2019s run really run over the past few quarters, both from a quality perspective. You\u2019re right, historically we\u2019ve had some quality issues but quality, we made significant improvements in quality over the past few quarters.", "And just to be real straight forward about it, the operating rates and reliability of liquid packaging had been kind of up the charts the last few quarters. Now again, we\u2019re excited about this, the outage and the capital that we\u2019re getting because we think that\u2019s going to allow us to take it to the next level. But this is not one where we go we\u2019re having big, big problems so we got to go spend this money, this is the one that\u2019s really going to just further enhance what we\u2019ve been able to do at this facility at least over the past year.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "That\u2019s where I was going with that question. Go ahead, Patty, I\u2019m sorry.", "Patty Bedient", "No, I was going to say George that as we look at the spending that\u2019s being done at Longview there is some spending for cleaners that will improve the quality. But as a percentage of the total dollars, it\u2019s a small amount of that. The big piece as well in this project is that it will allow us to upgrade the product mix coming out of that operation. Today, the excess fluff pulp goes into wet lap. And so there is not a great market for that. So we\u2019ll be able to change the product mix a little bit.", "And then again, the big piece will be just lowering the fiber cost and lowering the energy cost. So, it\u2019s not a place where as we look across our system that we would spend capital in any operation that we didn\u2019t think had the ability to run well and run reliably. And Longview has proven that. And I think they have a really good package going forward as it relates to the return that we\u2019ll get from these projects.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Last question and I\u2019ll turn it over. Would it be fair to say that in recognizing it is the Board\u2019s decision, that at this juncture, from your vantage point of the key metrics, either from a balance sheet standpoint or the operating fundamentals of the Company and the sectors that you\u2019re in, that you\u2019ve checked the box, so to speak, in terms of being able to raise the dividend in the next several quarters? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter.", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, I think George, going back to the comments that I made in December at the Investor Meeting. We said that we would be looking forward to increasing the dividend in the future but that would likely be after we closed the RICO transaction. And that is now closed and as Doyle said, we\u2019ll be visiting on that with the board at the next board meeting in mid-August.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Thank you, Patty.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with DA Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "Thanks, good morning, everyone.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "A couple that pertained to I guess the Wood Products segment. Starting with engineered wood products, I think you indicated that all of you facilities are now running and you\u2019re at around a 75% operating rate.", "Let\u2019s, if we call housing at $1 million, and potential $1.5 million, that\u2019s a 66% operating rate. Will you guys have sufficient engineered wood product when the housing actually hits mid cycle, particularly if EWP gains share versus solids on lumber?", "Doyle Simons", "So, as I have said, we\u2019re running at 75% kind of on a blended average across the system. Some of our mills are running more than that, some of our facilities are running less than that. So, clearly, in some products if housing continues to improve, we may not have enough production to always meet our customer\u2019s demand.", "In others we clearly do have as Patty mentioned, we\u2019re in the process of ramping up evergreen. So we\u2019ve clearly gotten more capacity there. So, we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re positioned overall in engineered lumber, in order to continue to service our customers as we move forward.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "But the capacity you have is the limit, right? Everything that has been de-commissioned has been demolished or is there any kind of temporarily or indefinitely idled capacity that still exists?", "Doyle Simons", "You\u2019re exactly right. The capacities that we have, is what we have. And so there is nothing sitting out there to go start back up, we\u2019re running what we have.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then, just on distribution, great to see it, turn the corner a little bit. Again looking towards mid cycle, can you give us a sense of the revenues and I guess EBITDA or margins are, please?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. It\u2019s hard to project exactly what revenues or earnings are going to be. But I\u2019ll just tell you as mentioned our commitment this year is to improve by $30 million to $40 million in our distribution. But let\u2019s be clear about it, that doesn\u2019t get us to where we absolutely need to be.", "We think as we do benchmarking versus our competition, we understand we are clearly not the leader. Our goal will be to be the leader in that business. And I\u2019ll just put it this way Steve, I think there is still a lot of run way. Once we accomplish the $30 million to $40 million this year, there is still a lot of run way in front of us to continue to improve earnings and cash flow out of that business going forward.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "Yes, I should think so. And so, therefore, would it be safe to say that your aspiration is to see 3%, perhaps 4% EBITDA margin once you\u2019re back at mid cycle potential?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, I mean, our goal is to be like I said the leader in that business. And those types of numbers are absolutely what we would be able to accomplish.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "Great. Thanks, Doyle.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yes, thanks very much. Morning, Doyle and Patty. Just a couple of easy questions here. Just trying to put in context on Cellulose Fibers, you mentioned the year to date record productivity. I know you\u2019ve moved to 18 months maintenance schedules on some of your mills. Just if you could give us an update on where you are in that program? And then how the year-to-date productivity record balances with that?", "Patty Bedient", "Sure, Paul. As it relates to the 18-month cycle, now all mills will be on an 18-month cycle. The last one really is Longview which was on 18-month and we took it down, it went down in \u201813, it\u2019s coming down this quarter or this year in order for us to be able to flip those capital improvements.", "But now they are all on an 18-month cycle going forward. So, I don\u2019t have the specific, how many mills and which year will be in \u201815 versus \u201814 in front of me. But they are all on that cycle.", "In terms of the productivity, that really is as we look at it, how are we doing in terms of our uptime and how are we doing in terms of our production per day. And all of our mills are really operating very strongly. And they are competing with each other as well as one gets better they benchmark each other and share best practices. And we\u2019re really pleased with the work that\u2019s being done by the folks in Cellulose Fibers.", "As I mentioned, the third quarter earnings will be significantly lower but that\u2019s because of the maintenance that we\u2019re doing because the mills aren\u2019t running well.", "Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, great to hear. And Doyle, you mentioned that you\u2019d be interested in growing the Wood Products business. Just curious as to which area within Wood Products is more highly sought after than other areas?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, and what I\u2019ve said on the wood products business is, our primary focus is continuing to run what we have better and again making progress there. In terms of specific businesses, there is not a specific business we feel compelled to grow at all.", "We like our position. And all of those \u2013 in those businesses, again we think our biggest opportunity is to run when we have better. With that said, if we find growth opportunities then we think can add additional value for our shareholders in that business that\u2019s something we would consider.", "Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Great thanks very much. Best of luck.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Patty Bedient", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.", "Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James", "Good morning, Patty and Doyle.", "Patty Bedient", "Good morning.", "Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James", "Congrats on the quarter. A couple of questions here. Can you guys discuss a little more about the trends you\u2019re seeing in the different wood baskets you operate in the US south?", "I know we\u2019ve heard kind of just generally out there that Arkansas and Mississippi is heavily lagged. Maybe as it relates to you guys the Carolinas. But put a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing, kind of your expectations there for the back half of the year?", "Doyle Simons", "Sure, so in terms of further on saw logs, we should step back and look at overall in the south, we saw log prices go up about 4% in \u201813 versus \u201812. As we mentioned earlier, we had seen saw log prices up modestly in the first half of \u201814 versus \u201813. And we think that trend will continue into the second half of \u201814.", "Yes, there are always some regional differences based on capacity, based on weather, based on a lot of different things. So yes, you do see some different things in mid south versus Gulf versus Atlantic, whatever the case may be. But overall, we continue to anticipate but continued improvement in saw log prices going forward.", "Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then, I don\u2019t know if maybe you guys could break out roughly how much of the EBIT during the quarter came from the south versus say the west?", "Patty Bedient", "I don\u2019t have that exact number in front of me. I would tell you that in terms of looking forward in the third quarter, most of the decrease in EBIT will come in the west versus the south because of the export markets both in terms of what the export markets are doing in export and then obviously that has an impact back to the domestic market as well.", "Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then, just to like following up on earlier question and I know it\u2019s early. But as you think about the \u2013 really the step-up in the run rate as far as the CapEx this year is. The $400 million kind of \u2013 is that even appropriate if we think about 2015 or could there be another, I guess, I\u2019m asking, could be there another leg up in terms of CapEx dollars, do you feel like this was kind of the high water mark?", "Patty Bedient", "Colin, as we look at our capital expenditure what will drive that is our ability to continue to have high quality projects which we would focus on as driving our cost down. So as Doyle said, we\u2019re still looking at those numbers. I hope actually that that number will go up a little bit because that means we do have good projects but we\u2019re still working through that as we are speaking.", "And I think the other thing that we have really had a focus on is making sure that before we spend capital, all of our operations are really operating well. So, we\u2019re not looking at growing capacity necessarily from additional capital spend, it really is focused on improving the cost position of our operations. But we\u2019ll be giving you more clarity on that as we get closer to the end of the year.", "Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then, again, going back to just the capital allocation and still recognizing you\u2019re in the middle of that process right now. Can you maybe just put a little more detail on how much time are you really actively spending right now looking at Timberland acquisition and growing that part of the book currently or has it really just been trying to again determine where you want to put capital to work and still kind of integrating Longview?", "Doyle Simons", "We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to grow our Timberland base. So, there is as you probably are assuming \u2013 I\u2019m sure you know there is some activity out there. There has been a pretty consistent flow. We look at every opportunity that comes along. We take a disciplined approach to it. And we will continue to do that.", "So, no, we didn\u2019t \u2013 Longview has been a fantastic acquisition for us. We\u2019re well ahead of our synergy targets. We\u2019re on track to deliver the EBITDA that we indicated out of that acquisition. But we didn\u2019t put other things on hold as we went through that process. We\u2019ve continued to look. Again, we\u2019ll be very disciplined but we think there will be opportunities to grow our Timberland base going forward and we\u2019re focused on doing just that.", "Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ve now reached the allotted time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Doyle for closing remarks.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining this morning. Before we sign-off, one thing I would like to do as, I would like to acknowledge Kathy McAuley who actually retired effective today. It\u2019s hard to express just how much Kathy has contributed to Weyerhaeuser during her 14 years with us. Patty and I would like to offer our sincere thanks. And more importantly wish her all the best in her retirement.", "As we have previously announced Denise Merle has taken on responsibility as Senior Vice President of HR and Investor Relations. And Beth Baum is the Director of Investor Relations. They will both be available to answer any follow-up questions that you may have. And again, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And we appreciate your interest in Weyerhaeuser.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Denise M. Merle", "Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2014 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website.", "On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations.", "I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle R. Simons", "Thank you, Denise. Welcome, everyone, and Happy Halloween.", "This morning, we reported strong third quarter results in each of our businesses as our employees continue to drive sustainable performance improvements through relentless execution of our operational excellence initiatives.", "Net earnings for the quarter totaled approximately $1.15 billion or $2.15 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.9 billion. This includes a gain of approximately $970 million related to the July 7 divestiture of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.", "Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we earned $178 million or $0.33 per diluted share, an increase of almost 31% compared with the year-ago quarter. Special items for the third quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to a post-retirement health plan and restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions.", "I will begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about market conditions. Housing starts continued to improve in the third quarter but at a measured pace. We now anticipate approximately 1 million housing starts for 2014. We are confident that housing markets will continue to strengthen, supported by employment growth and increasing consumer confidence.

Timberlands contributed $136 million to third quarter earnings compared with $170 million in the second quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes declined as we intentionally accelerated harvest during early 2014 in anticipation of lower price realizations in the third quarter.", "Realization for Western logs declined due to the normal -- due to normal seasonal increases in domestic supply and softer Asian markets. Inventories at Chinese ports, although down from their peak, are still elevated and takeaway remains below normal levels.", "Sales volumes to Japan increased due to timing of shipments. Our Longview Timber acquisition contributed $36 million of EBITDA in the third quarter and remains on track to achieve our 2014 target of $175 million to $185 million of EBITDA.", "In the South, fee harvest volumes increased due to improved weather conditions. Average realizations for southern logs rose slightly compared with the second quarter.", "Third quarter earnings included $19 million from disposition of nonstrategic timberlands, a decrease of $5 million compared with second quarter. Operational excellence initiatives to optimize truck scheduling, road construction and maintenance and silviculture practices contributed to Timberlands' strong performance in the quarter.", "Wood Products, Charts 6 and 7. Wood Products earned $105 million in the third quarter, a slight improvement compared with the second quarter. EBITDA increased to $135 million. In lumber, EBITDA improved by $8 million compared with the second quarter.", "Average price realizations improved approximately 1% as higher realizations for narrow lumber were partially offset by lower prices for wide dimension lumber. Log cost for our western mills declined and operating rates fell slightly. This business continues to implement operational excellence initiatives focused on reducing manufacturing cost net of logs.", "In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $3 million compared with second quarter as a decline in average realizations was partially offset by lower manufacturing cost. This business remains focused on lowering cost, improving operating reliability and increasing sales of higher-value products.", "Engineered wood products reported third quarter EBITDA of $27 million, a slight decrease compared with second quarter. Average sales realizations improved for solid section products in TJI joists as we captured the value of our announced second quarter price increase and benefited from a favorable sales mix. These improvements were offset by lower sales volumes across most product lines as second quarter included prebuying in advance of the price increase and customers managed inventories tightly during the third quarter.", "The distribution business reported EBITDA of $5 million in the third quarter, an improvement of $2 million. This business remains focused on improving margins and lowering costs. Our engineered wood products and distribution businesses continued to make strong progress against their operational excellence targets, and we remain confident that both of these businesses will improve EBITDA by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 compared with 2013.", "Cellulose Fibers, Charts 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $59 million to earnings, down from $91 million in the second quarter. Fluff pulp markets remained strong through the third quarter, and average realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board increased. This was offset by substantially higher maintenance costs due to a scheduled increase in maintenance outage days within the pulp mill system and an extended planned outage at our liquid packaging board facility. Our liquid packaging board facility restarted in early October and is running well following the safe and successful completion of several maintenance and capital projects. The Cellulose Fibers business continues to demonstrate excellent offer -- excellent operational performance.", "Let me now switch gears briefly to SG&A and other matters. Our SG&A initiative remains on track, and I am highly confident we will achieve our $70 million run-rate reduction target by year-end.", "On August 13, our Board of Directors approved a 32% increase in our quarterly dividend and authorized a $700 million share repurchase program.

Bedient", "Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for the fourth quarter is on Chart 11. I will begin my comments with Timberlands.", "Starting with log exports in the West. Log inventories at Chinese ports are still at elevated levels, which will likely result in somewhat lower sales volumes to China this quarter. We also expect lower sales volumes to Japan, primarily as a result of timing of shipments, and realization for our Japanese exports are expected to increase modestly due to mix.", "Sales realizations for domestic logs in the West are expected to increase compared to the third quarter. In the South, we anticipate volumes will increase slightly with flat pricing.", "Silviculture costs are expected to increase seasonally. Earnings from nonstrategic Timberlands sales and miscellaneous items are anticipated to be approximately $15 million lower in Q4 compared to Q3, primarily as a result of timing. Excluding these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the third quarter.", "In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter is the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Because of the seasonal slowdown, we expect lower sales volumes across all product lines.", "Average sales realizations for both lumber and OSB are expected to weaken relative to the third quarter. Log costs are anticipated to increase somewhat with seasonal inventory build and weather-related restrictions.", "Production volumes in the fourth quarter will decrease due to the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. This downtime will result in higher per-unit manufacturing costs. Consistent with the normal seasonal pattern, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment to be lower than the third quarter, and likely comparable to the fourth quarter of last year.", "Moving on to Cellulose Fibers. Worldwide inventories for softwood pulp at the end of the third quarter were at 27 days, slightly below normal levels. Demand for our products continues to be strong, especially for our fluff pulp, and we expect mostly -- pricing to be stable in the fourth quarter. Sales realizations for liquid packaging board are expected to be somewhat lower due to grade mix, and fiber costs are expected to be higher.", "Total maintenance expense for the segment will be much lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. As I discussed on our last quarter call, we had an extended planned shutdown at our Longview operation during the third quarter for maintenance and installation of capital equipment. We had a very successful startup of the mill, which was completed during the first week of this month. The mill is running well, and customer response has been very positive. During the fourth quarter, we planned only one mill down for maintenance. That shutdown was completed earlier this month, and that mill is also back up and running well. We expect earnings on our Cellulose Fibers segment to be significantly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third.", "Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. As shown on Chart 12, during the third quarter, we invested approximately $112 million in capital expenditures in our businesses. This brings our year-to-date expenditures through the third quarter to $271 million, and we still estimate total expenditures for the year, including reforestation, to be approximately $400 million.", "As reported earlier, we completed the divestiture of our home building business in early July. As a result of the transaction, we retired approximately 59 million shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of over $700 million during the third quarter. These proceeds, combined with strong cash flow from operations during the quarter, resulted in a cash balance of approximately $1.6 billion as of the end of the third quarter.", "Chart 13 details significant actions we are taking to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In August, the board increased our quarterly cash dividend by 32% to $0.29 per share or $1.16 on an annual basis.", "Based on the closing stock price at the end of the third quarter, that equates to a 3.6% yield. In August, the board also authorized a $700 million share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares, using approximately $130 million, at an average price of $33.63.", "As a result of the WRECO divestiture and of the share repurchase program, we reduced our outstanding share count during the quarter by over 10%.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle.", "Doyle R. Simons", "Thank you, Patty. As many of you have heard me say over the past few months, we are relentlessly focused on performance and capital allocation to grow shareholder value. The pace with which we have begun to execute our share repurchase program illustrates our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. Through our operational excellence initiatives, we remain focused on driving performance to sustainably grow earnings and cash flow and deliver additional value to our shareholders.", "And now I'd like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a question on Wood Products. If I look year-to-date, it seems like your third-party sales volumes in lumber and OSB are sort of flat with the first 3 quarters of 2013. And if I think that housing starts are growing, and maybe your operating rates are in the low 90s and you have maybe some room to ratchet them up, is there a reason that your volumes in lumber specifically aren't up more year-over-year? And by that same token, if we do 1.1 million to 1.2 million starts next year, would you expect your volumes to be up in 2015 by a decent amount?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Anthony, as we look at our volumes for lumber, I think, year-to-date -- based on year-to-date, we were pretty flat, as you said. But I think that the third quarter, we probably produced a little bit less than what we thought we would. And as we look at 2015, I think that we have the ability to increase with the market, which, as Doyle said, we don't have a real robust outlook for housing starts, although they will continue to improve as we move forward.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Okay. And then, Doyle, last week, one of your competitors in fluff pulp said it was exploring the possibility of putting their mill system in an MLP structure. And I was wondering, obviously, Weyerhaeuser's a REIT, and the Cellulose Fiber's business is in a TRS. But is the MLP angle something that you've looked at? Or do you have any thoughts you can share on whether this structure might ultimately be appropriate for Cellulose Fibers?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes, and that, Anthony, is something we have looked at, and I'll ask Patty to give a little bit more color on that, because she's coordinating that effort for us.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Anthony, we are actively looking at the applicability of the structure. As you know, there are a number of uncertainties, and not the least of those is the fact that the IRS has put on pause issuing any additional private letter rulings until they've completed a thorough review of the MLP structure overall. We don't have clarity on when that will be, but we do continue to monitor the situation. And if we think it will add value, we'll move forward with our review. We have consulted our advisers, and we have included their input into our review. As you probably know, a number of years ago, there was a private letter ruling for pulp, but private letter rulings are fact-specific, and technically, can only be relied on by the taxpayer that's making that particular application. And given the fact that the IRS is now undertaking an in-depth review, we don't think it would be prudent to move forward without a ruling. And so we're sort of on pause, waiting to see what happens. We haven't made any decisions one way or the other, but we'll continue to monitor the situation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Doyle, Patty. Doyle, the progress that you're making in the Wood Products business is pretty impressive. I wondered if you could give us a sense of where you think the gains are coming from. Is it kind of better commercial performance, just better operating performance, reduced cost? And where do you think you are on a sort of a scale of 1 to 10, in terms of optimizing those wood businesses?", "Doyle R. Simons", "So Mark, thanks for that comment. And there is a lot of really good work going on in our Wood Products businesses. In terms of the progress we're making, as we've identified, and starting with lumber, we said that we think there's $100 million opportunity there, and as we've previously said, we'll think we'll get $30 million to $40 million of that in 2014. And then part of what we're going to be doing on December 9, Mark, on our Investor Day is being -- laying out more details of what we think the opportunity is and the timing is in that business and our others going forward. In OSB, similarly, we've made some progress there. More work to do, but again we've identified 50 to 60 of operational excellence opportunities, and more work to do there. We will get 5 to 10 of that, we believe, in 2014. In ELP and distribution where we had, in my opinion, and I think most people's opinions, the biggest opportunity to improve. As I said in my comments, very encouraged by the progress we are making in both of those businesses, and we believe we're going to improve. Despite not great housing starts, we think we're going to improve both the EBITDA in both of those businesses by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013, and we're on track to do that. I would tell you, Mark, to your exact question, there's still a lot of work to do in both of those businesses and opportunities. With the $30 million to $40 million, the way we think about it proves that we -- or shows that we've earned the right to be in those businesses, and our next step is to show that we can win in those businesses, and part of winning, of course, is earning above cost of capital over the cycle. So good progress there, very encouraged by all the hard work that our employees have done, but still a lot of work to do in both of our ELP and distribution businesses.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Okay. And if I could, as a follow-on, just for Patty, even if we assume the rest of the share repurchase were to happen in the fourth quarter, it still looks like you're going to be sitting on over $1 billion of cash. Can you talk to us about how much cash you want to carry going forward? And just thoughts on the use of that residual cash.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure, Mark. In terms of how much cash we carry, it's a function of where we are in the cycle, it -- we'll use some cash in the first quarter. At least, we hope to use some cash in the first quarter to build some working capital as housing recovers. So that's one place that we're looking. We also are continuing to utilize the share repurchase, as you said. As we look at capital allocation, our priorities for capital allocation, first and foremost, has been returning cash to shareholders. We increased the dividend, as we talked about. Continuing to execute on that share repurchase. And then, we'll also be investing in our businesses in our capital expenditure program. We'll give you a little more color on that when we get to our December Investor Day and then certainly on our earnings call for the fourth quarter. I would expect that may be a little higher than this current year, not a huge magnitude. And then obviously, as we've said before, we're looking to grow our businesses in a disciplined way. Our first priority there would be in Timberlands, but there's no imperative that I have to grow. So we're being very disciplined about looking at all areas where we would utilize that cash. In addition, we do have the credit line that doesn't expire until September of 2018. $1 billion that has not been utilized to this point. So we really feel very good about our opportunities to continue to provide value to shareholders as we go forward. So it's a nice place to be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Doyle, I guess my first question, maybe this is under the category of \"no good deed goes unpunished.\" I mean, you've done quite well in Wood Products, Mark was noting that in his Q&A. If we look at Slide 7 of your deck, we generally see product prices that are flat to higher on average than where they were last year, OSB maybe being an exception there. We know the progress that you're making in cost reductions and operational excellence. So I was just curious why, if I heard you correctly, fourth quarter guidance and EBIT for Wood will be flat year-on-year, not to mention the progress you've already made this year-to-date? And then I had a couple of follow-ons.", "Doyle R. Simons", "George, I would say, just from a seasonal perspective, as you know, the fourth quarter is the slowest seasonal period. So that's going to have some pick on -- impact on our performance in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. If you look year-over-year, we have made improvements, as you've said, and part of the year-over-year will be impacted by sales realizations. We'll -- it remains to be seen what happens in the quarter. I will tell you, currently, lumber prices are down roughly $10 in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. OSB, down roughly $5 in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But part of it, of course, will be, if you look at pricing on the chart that you refer to, specifically in OSB, if you look at it year-over-year levels, pricing will be down fairly significantly in OSB fourth quarter of 2014 versus fourth quarter of 2013. So we'll see how that plays out for the balance of the year, but that's the biggest driver of what's going on.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, and that's fair. We appreciate the thought. If we switch gears a little bit, but still within Wood Products, and I recognize, again, this is probably going to be something you'll talk more about in detail on December 9, can you give us a little bit of a flavor in terms of what kinds of investments you're making within the mills? Is it similar to what you did at your former shop in terms of automation and improvement of yield? But -- can you give us a little bit more color there? And then, my follow-on, and I'll turn it over, again, you're clearly getting improvement in SG&A, at least in terms of the numbers that we are seeing across the segment. Do you worry at all that with the cost reductions, and you're on target for your $75 million, that at some point in time, that begins to impact negatively your ability to be commercially more effective within Wood Products, i.e., you cut a little bit too much on the cost side, cut into the bone?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Thanks, George, for the questions. So in terms of what we're doing in investment in our Wood Products businesses, George, those are specific investments that will be made to lower our costs. This is proven technology that's in place in some of our mills, and we will be extending that to additional mills. But again, the key focus is on investments, improving technology that are focused on lowering costs. This is technology that we are comfortable with, we know how to put it in and are confident as we implement these capital expenditures that we will ultimately get the cost reduction associated with that. In terms of the SG&A, as I said earlier, we are on track to achieve the $75 million cost-reduction initiatives in SG&A. With that said, I am not worried at all about that cutting into the bone, as you said, in Wood Products. These are cost-reduction initiatives across the entire organization, and we are making sure that we are still very well positioned from a commercial standpoint and able to do what is necessary to service our customers going forward. So no concern regarding that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Doyle, with all of the work on operational improvement, do you think we're going to see a faster rate of growth in profits in REIT income or TRS income over the next, say, 12 and 24 months, assuming housing continues the slow recovery?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Mark, as you know, we are looking at operational excellence across the entire organization, in our Timberlands business as well as our manufacturing businesses, and we've laid out specific targets for both. We've given an update on where we are on each of those for 2014 versus 2013. And we'll, as I said, in December 9, be giving more clarity on what 2015 looks like. So I think there's opportunity, Mark, and clearly on the REIT assets, on the Timberland, and encouraged by the progress we're making there, and there's also opportunities on the manufacturing side, both in Wood Products and Cellulose Fiber. If you look at it just from a dollar basis in terms of what we've laid out and add it up, the bigger numbers are, of course, in Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers combined, compared with the Timberland business, but we're focused on operational excellence across into -- our entire organization including, as you'd -- as we just alluded to, the $75 million of SG&A.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Okay. And just one more question. How much of the improvement that we saw in engineered wood this quarter was attributable to lower OSB prices? And should we assume that, that division has already seen the full benefits of the decline we've seen so far?", "Doyle R. Simons", "So only a minor part, Mark, of the -- of what you saw in the ELP was a result of the lower OSB prices. And yes, you should assume -- we'll see what happens to OSB prices from this point forward, but yes, you should assume most of that benefit has played through the system.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.", "Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, just given things where housing starts are and where southern sawlog prices are and just with your thoughts on sort of housing starts for 2015, could you share some thoughts, I guess, on the type of harvest growth you may be planning for in the West and the South as we look out to 2015?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes. No, on the southern harvest, we have kind of been expecting, as we've talked to you about, a slow, steady increase in southern sawlog pricing for 2014. And that's generally what we've seen, up 3% to 4%. We continue to have consistent demand from our customers. So we're not planning, at this time, any type of deferral as we look into 2015. We'll continue to keep a close eye on market conditions. Just in terms of how we think about our harvest overall, what we look at is the financial maturity of -- and the expected market demand, and those are the factors that we use to build our harvest plans going forward, and we're working on those for 2015. We also, as you know and we've talked about, have the ability to flex some during a year and during a specific quarter. And you saw some of that earlier this year as we capitalized on stronger export prices in the first half of 2014 and 2015. And we'll continue to hopefully capitalize on those opportunities in 2015 and beyond.", "Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on the Wood Products side, I don't know if you could kind of quantify the type of volume declines you're looking for in the fourth quarter. And then, I mean, is this -- are these declines just sort of typical seasonal declines? Or are they driven by, I guess, a greater-than-expected drop in demand at all?", "Doyle R. Simons", "No, these -- what we are talking about, Tyler, is just your typical seasonal-type slowdown in the fourth quarter. As Patty said in her comments, the fourth quarter is typically the slowest seasonal period from a Wood Products perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe tagging on, on the question of kind of 2015 outlook, and again, I appreciate we'll get more either in December or January, but given the housing outlook that you put out for 2015, how do you think that affects the trajectory of sawlog pricing in the South? Do you think it's kind of more of the same? Do you see any chance for acceleration?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Gail, our best guess on southern sawlog pricing is we will continue to see slow, steady improvement. I think the range we gave on housing, 1.1 million to 1.2 million; at the upper end of that range, I think you could see maybe an acceleration in pricing in southern sawlog, even above the 3% to 4% that we anticipate for 2014. If it's at the lower end of that rage, then maybe it's more in the 3%, 4%, 5% range that we've seen for -- or we anticipate for 2014 versus 2013. So that's our kind of best guess on southern sawlogs in the near term.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of the log export markets? How severe do you think the inventory situation is in China? How long do you think it would take to normalize? And x the timing of volumes to Japan, can you give us a sense of kind of the underlying trend in Japan, particularly relative to -- has it fully worked through the consumption tax at this point?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure, Gail. This is Patty. As we think about China, as I've said, inventories are still at higher-than-normal levels, and the takeaway is going a little slower than probably what we would have expected last quarter when we were on the call. But they are working their way through. That'll probably take through the rest of this quarter. So we don't anticipate any significant change in direction for the quarter other than what I talked about earlier. In Japan, I think that, stepping back from that, too, you'd have to say there's the Japanese market overall, but then there's also the customers that we have. And the customers that we have worked with, as you know, for some of them well over 20 years, are really talking to us about making sure that they get the volume that they need to support their operations. So they're large customers. They have very efficient supply chains, both in terms of the supply for logs, but importantly as well, how they merchandise lumber in Japan. So volumes in Japan, as I said, are primarily down because of timing. We had a little better shipments in the third quarter, as Doyle talked about in his remarks. So we are still confident in our Japan volumes, although pricing will be impacted as we go forward based upon what things do overall. But we do expect our realizations to Japan for this quarter to be up a little bit because we'll have a little bit higher freight to Japan, relative.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And on engineered wood, do you think the volume you saw in the third quarter is reflective of kind of the underlying market? Or was it depressed due to payback from the outside strength in the second quarter?", "Doyle R. Simons", "I think, the -- we clearly saw, as we indicated after the second quarter -- or on the second quarter call, Gail, some pre-buying in the second quarter, due to the price increase that went in late in the second quarter in our engineered wood business. So I think maybe if you average the 2, that would probably be kind of the normalized rate. But clearly, we had some pre-buying in the second quarter versus the third.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last quick one. Patty, can you possibly quantify, particularly since it seems like you're already done, what the outage expense would be for the fourth quarter in Cellulose?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Sure, Gail. As we looked at Cellulose Fibers, if you look at Chart 9, where we detailed the maintenance expense and outage days, so in the third quarter, we had about 38 days of maintenance downtime. We would expect, because we are now complete, that, that would be about 14 days for the fourth quarter. So that's a difference of around 24 days. And as I've said in the past, each day is usually about $1 million. So it's around a $20 million delta from third quarter to fourth quarter, which is the primary difference between our outlook for the fourth quarter as it compares to the third.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Doyle, engineered wood products, could you just talk about how engineered wood is performing in the marketplace relative to lumber in single-family construction? And any progress, if any of those been made, in further penetrating the multifamily end market with engineered wood?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Sure, so in engineered wood, we continue to be, as I mentioned earlier, about the -- encouraged by the progress that we're making. As you see from our overall shipment numbers, we continue to gain in terms of capturing profitable share going forward. And some of that is coming from multifamily. Still, the -- I don't want to mislead you. The key driver for engineered wood has been and will continue to be single-family, but we have had some successes in moving into multifamily in terms of our engineered wood products.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then, at the Analyst Day last year, we talked about the performance in engineered wood and distribution, that it materially improved, and that potentially, those businesses will not be part of the portfolio longer term. Obviously, we've seen very meaningful improvement in those businesses. So are we at a point now where the improvement is enough where we would -- we can say that engineered wood and distribution will be part of Weyerhaeuser for the long term?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Alex, the way I would answer that is -- and I think I said this earlier, is the $30 million to $40 million was necessary to show that we deserve the right to be in those businesses. I think we are delivering on that. So our next step now is to show that we can win in these businesses, and again, we define winning as showing that we can earn above cost of capital in each of these businesses over a cycle. That's going to take some additional work in each of these businesses going forward, but that's what we're focused on doing, winning both from a cost of capital perspective and showing that we can be the leader in each of these businesses going forward. And that's the way we think about it.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Understood. I mean, just last one on share buybacks. So good to see that happen in the quarter. Should we read into an issue -- in terms of the amount and the timing, is that any sort of potential number that we could see consistently on a go-forward basis? Is that some sort of run rate that we can think about on a go-forward basis that you could -- you can buy back?", "Doyle R. Simons", "No, what I would read into it is the fact that we are committed to executing this share repurchase plan in a -- on a timely basis. The comment we made when we announced this authorization is this is one we fully anticipated completing on a timely basis. We will report to you, just as we did this quarter, the progress we're making going forward. But I wouldn't read into, just to say we're going to do this amount every quarter based on what we did for half a quarter in third quarter of 2014.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Doyle and Patty, first question is, we've seen a pretty interesting divergence of opinion in the last few weeks. And one way you guys can, of course, buy timber is just by buying your own stock, and it looks like we've seen 2 of your competitors, one step up and pay pretty close to peak prices, I guess, for southern lands, and another of your competitors decided to focus more on, not only maybe being buying back stock, but actually selling land into The Street to buy back stock. And I didn't know if you had an opinion on what you thought of land values. And I'm really thinking of the South at this point, where there seems to be a divergence of opinion, and whether we would see you step up now or hang back?", "Doyle R. Simons", "So Chip, I think you can look at our actions in terms of the way we think about things. Clearly, as we've already highlighted, we are in the market actively repurchasing our shares. So we are convinced that we are creating value for our shareholders for doing that. In terms of actively buying timberland, there's no doubt that there are lots of opportunities out there to do that in today's market. There's also lots of money chasing those deals. We look at those deals, each and every one of them that comes along. And as we've said before, we're going to be very disciplined in what we actually acquire. And to date, we have not made any acquisitions in the South. The type of transactions we're looking for, again, actions, are the ones that are along the lines of what we did in the Longview acquisition. And you can look at the type of returns that we are generating from that acquisition that we made last year. That's not a South-versus-West statement, Chip. We'd look for -- if the right opportunities are there, that where we think we can grow value for shareholders, we would look at making acquisitions, both in the West and in the South. But we're just going to continue to be very disciplined in the way we look at those potential acquisition opportunities going forward.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Last year, I seem to recall that you all made a point of saying that lumber and OSB were a little bit more strategic and possible areas of growth through acquisition, than say, EWP and distribution. And I just wanted to know if you're still open to making acquisitions if the right thing comes along in those 2 businesses that you've mentioned. And if those other 2 businesses, EWP and distribution, continue to improve, as they've certainly done this year, could they also be areas that maybe in a couple of years you could see growing in?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Chip, I don't specifically remember making the comment that you just referred to, but let me talk about how we think about acquisitions generally. As we've consistently said, we think our biggest opportunities for acquisitions are going to be in our Timberland business. With that said, if we can add -- find acquisition opportunities in our Wood Products business, or Cellulose Fiber business for that matter, that will result in additional shareholder value, that's something we would look at. Now we don't feel compelled to grow any of our businesses. But again, if we can find bolt-on type acquisitions in Wood Products or Cellulose Fibers that we think add value for shareholders, that's something we would potentially consider. But again, we think our biggest opportunities for acquisition will be in our Timberland business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just a couple of cleanups. In engineered wood, can you please tell us what your operating rate was in the quarter? And what you expect it to be in 2015?", "Doyle R. Simons", "The operating rate in the third quarter, Steve, continued to be in the mid-7 range -- so roughly 70%- to 75%-type range operating rates in EWP in the third quarter. And we'll see what happens to housing. But I don't think that number will -- so I would anticipate, if housing continues to improve, that number could go up going forward.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Yes, and I was going to say, given that housing has kind of underwhelmed over the last couple of years, is it appropriate to budget your production to the lower end of that 1.1 million to 1.2 million range? Maybe particularly with respect to OSB?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Well, yes. OSB is a different story, of course. And what I would tell you in OSB is we took 20 days of downtime in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we would anticipate higher amounts of downtime due to normal seasonal factors, holiday season and some maintenance and capital projects that are going in place in terms of OSB in the fourth quarter.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Great. The final question, with respect to your understanding of MLPs, is converting logs into lumber panels in EWP also eligible? Or is it just for pulp-based businesses?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Steve, as I said before, that the IRS has a project, a very complete project that they've undertaken, and it seems they're taking even a little bit longer than maybe what was anticipated when they announced the project, which was back towards the beginning of this year. So I think it's difficult to know, really, where they'll come out on their deliberations. What we do know, as I said before, was a number of years ago, they did have a ruling on pulp. But whether or not they will modify that ruling and application going forward, and whether or not they would say anything about the other businesses is still yet to be known. So tough to give you any more clarity. I wish we all had a little more clarity at this point, but that's sort of what we know as we sit here today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I too, like George, was looking at Chart 7, where you had Wood Products volumes and pricing. And I had something of a different question, and that's the lumber, engineered wood and if we threw plywood on here, it'd be the same. Prices have been pretty good over the last 1.5 years. Obviously, OSB has been a very different story. There was a lot of restarts last year, but that was a while ago. Any thoughts as to why it's taking so long for OSB to regain its footing and what needs to happen for the markets to get into balance and more profitable?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Mark, I think you said it right. There was significant additional supply that came online, I think in anticipation of maybe stronger housing starts than we've seen occur in the 2014-type time frame. So I think it's a simple supply-and-demand equation that appears to be out of balance currently, and that's what has resulted in the current pricing environment.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Do you think there are any structural impediments, though, to regaining balance? Because I'm not sure the operating rates in engineered wood are higher, or for that matter in gypsum, than in OSB. It just seems to be that the market struggles to adjust to the demand situation. Any thoughts as to what impediments might be in place?", "Doyle R. Simons", "No, Mark, I don't think there are any long-term structural impediments. OSB tends to be very volatile, as you very well know, over a cycle, and I think we're just in one of those periods of low pricing currently.", "Patricia M. Bedient", "One thing I would say, Mark, that's different in the 2 technologies. OSB, when capacity comes on the market, comes on in pretty big chunks, and people seek to run those mills 24/7 because of the type of operation that they are. So I think when new capacity starts up, as we saw a number of mills earlier this year, it takes a longer time for the market to absorb it if the housing doesn't recover as quickly as I think what people anticipated as we started the year. So I think I would point to that as the difference between the 2 technologies. Lumber, similarly, also is a more fragmented business that capacity comes on in smaller chunks than what OSB does.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Fair enough. And certainly, I realize it's not your job to be prognosticating on price actions, et cetera, but given your housing starts forecast for next year, is it feasible that OSB gets into balance? Or do you think we're still a ways away?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Mark, I think, as we move through 2015 and housing continues to improve, I think they're in the range that we laid out. You could see an environment -- and again, we're not prognosticators of pricing and we'll leave that to others, but I think you could see a point where that is more in balance going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, just following up on, I think, Chip's question on Timberland transactions and trying to get your viewpoint about your actions. If you could give us a little bit more color on your nonstrategic Timberland sales, where are those happening? Is it more West-based than South? And in terms of transaction values, are you seeing a steady increase over the last year?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes, so we have those in both the West and the South. I'll give you an example of one that was in the third quarter. It happened to be in Oklahoma. It was a tract that was roughly 760 acres, and it sold for $14,000-plus per acre. So that's an example of what we see occurring out in the marketplace right now. So some of it's truly nonstrategic, some of it's more HBU-type land, and that's what we've seen going on, and we think will continue to be opportunities for us going forward.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and just getting back to the Q4 outlook on lower lumber and OSB pricing. Just specifically on the OSB side, it looks like those prices bottomed out in September, and we've seen, depending on the region, about anywhere from 10% to 14% price lifts since that point. What's your level of confidence that prices will be lower quarter-over-quarter?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Again, we're not better than anybody else in predicting what's going to happen on prices. The number that I referenced earlier is, if you look at third quarter average versus October-to-date prices, October-to-date is down roughly $5 for our overall mix. So that's to give you some sense of where we are today. Now again, that third quarter average, you referenced end of the third quarter, but if you look at third quarter average versus October-to-date, that's where we ended up.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James.", "Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of cleanups here. Just kind of a follow-up to Gail's question on Japan. You mentioned that you're seeing better realizations in 4Q due to mix. How are like comparable-quality log prices? Are they still falling in that market? Or are you actually starting to see some stabilization and lift on kind of an apples-to-apples basis there?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "I would say that Japan is stable as it relates to price, overall. And as I said, both in terms of the volume to Japan, we are also very pleased with the customer relationships that we have that really are focused on making sure that they have adequate supply of Douglas fir logs in order to supply their large operations.", "Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, Patty. And then, as far as the Cellulose Fibers guidance for 4Q, could you see, as far as from an earnings contribution, a bounce back all the way to what you saw in 2Q? Or is it probably going to fall out somewhere between what we had saw in 3Q and -- I'm sorry, between 2Q and 3Q?", "Patricia M. Bedient", "Well, I think, as you look at that, the major difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter is going to be that roughly $20 million of maintenance expense that I referenced when Gail asked her question. There are some puts and takes and other -- I said liquid packaging realizations will be down. Pulp pricing should be pretty stable. But the major difference between the 2 is that -- 2 quarters, is that $20 million of maintenance.", "Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, Patty. And then just one last big-picture question, Doyle, and kind of a follow-up to both Chip's and Paul's questions. Just given the strong bid for timberland right now, have you thought about just becoming more aggressive as far as capital recycling within the Timberland business? More specifically, are there certain wood baskets in the U.S. South that you want to try and get more aggressive in and have a bigger presence in, and maybe exit some of the regions you are in now? Because just looking at your footprint in the region, there are some areas in states where you have a pretty large concentration, and then some other areas where we're seeing arguably a little bit better signs of a price recovery in sawlogs that you're not in. So are you looking at kind of shifting some capital around within Timberland from that perspective?", "Doyle R. Simons", "Yes, that's a good question. And as you, I think, know, and as we've talked about before, we're always looking to improve through trading and buying and selling the overall quality of our timberlands. And some of that may include, as you alluded to, potentially getting in markets maybe that we're not in, although we're in most of the markets currently. So those are things that we are", "[Audio Gap]", "to consider going forward. With that said, we have, as you know, a pretty good footprint in terms of -- both in the South and in the West in terms of where our strategic timberland is located. And we're convinced that through growing and harvesting trees on that strategic timberland, we're going to be able to drive value for our shareholders going forward. But we're always looking to improve the overall quality of our timberland base, and I think we've had some success in doing that historically, and we'll continue to look at opportunities to do that going forward.", "So as I understand it, that was our final question. As we wrap up this morning's call, I want to just remind everybody that we will be holding an investor meeting on December 9. That's going to be at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York. Our business leaders will be participating in that meeting. We're looking forward to that meeting, and we look forward to seeing each of you there. So with that, thanks, everybody, for joining in on the call this morning, and we thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.

Please go ahead.", "Denise Merle", "Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2014 earnings. On the call with me this morning, are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website.", "I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Denise and good morning everyone. As we enter 2014, we embark in the journey here at Weyerhaeuser to grow at truly great company. As we said at that time, the three primary levers we are pulling to drive shareholders, our portfolio performance and capital allocation. Over the past year, we've made significant progress. Specifically in 2014, we'd divested our home building business to become a focused forest product company, achieved our 2014 operational excellence targets and improved earnings from our continuing operations before special items about 22% to $700 million or $1.25 per diluted share compared with $572 million or $0.99 per diluted share in 2013.", "In addition, we increased our dividend by 32%, authorized a new $700 million share repurchase program and within five months completed nearly 30% of that authorization. Through these actions, we demonstrated our commitment to delivering shareholder value and our total share of return for the full year of 2014 exceeded 17%.", "Included in these full year results are the strong fourth quarter operating earnings we reported this morning. We out earned $166 million or $0.31 per diluted for the fourth quarter. Our net sales from continuing operations of $1.8 billion excluding special items, we are into $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share an increase of 31% compared with the year ago quarter.", "Special items for the fourth quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to post-retirement health plan and restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions. I'll begin the discussion of our businesses performance with some brief comments on housing. Housing starts showed continued improvement in the fourth quarter, albeit at a modest rate. U.S. housing starts totalled just over $1 million for 2014, an improvement of approximately 9% compared with 2013.", "We are confident that housing markets will continue to strengthen in 2015 at accelerating employment growth; strong consumer confidence, low mortgage rates and initiatives to improve mortgage availability should support increased household formation. We anticipate over $1.1 million housing starts for 2015. Let me now turn to our business segments starting with timberlands, Chart 4 to 6.", "Timberlands contributed $143 million to fourth quarter earnings compared with a $136 million in the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes increased as we were able to access tracks that had limited operations during the third quarter's fire season. Average realizations for Western logs rose due to tighter domestic markets and a favorable export log mix.", "Japanese demand remained solid during the quarter. Chinese demand slowed and prices for Chinese export logs declined. Although Chinese inventories decreased during the fourth quarter, they remained above normalized levels and the weak Rouble improved the competitive position of Russian logs.", "Operational excellence initiatives to drag each log to its most profitable customer contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. [indiscernible] acquisition contributed $44 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter. This acquisition has been fully integrated into our Timberlands operations.", "In the south, fee harvest volumes rose and average realization increased compared with the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings included $3 million from disposition of non-strategic Timberlands, a decrease of $16 million compared with the third quarter. Our Timberlands business met or exceeded all of its operational excellence target for 2014 including $194 million of EBITDA from the Longview acquisition against the target of $175 million to $185 million, $29 million of synergies against the target of $20 million and over $20 million of operational excellence improvements.", "We anticipate an additional $20 million to $30 million of operational excellence improvements in 2015 in this business. I will turn to wood products Chart 7 and 8. Wood products contributed $56 million in the seasonally weak fourth quarter down from $105 million in the third quarter. Earnings for the segment were comparable to the fourth quarter 2013 as benefits from our operational excellence initiatives offset a 13% year-over-year decline in average OSB realizations.", "Wood products EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2014 totalled $86 million compared with $135 million in the third quarter. In lumber, EBITDA totalled $65 million average price realizations declined approximately 4% compared with the third quarter. Log cost of western and southern mills increased and per unit manufacturing cost rose due to seasonally lower production volumes.", "In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared with the third quarter due to a 4% decrease in average realizations. Engineered wood products reported fourth quarter EBITDA $14 million, a slight increase in average sales realizations was more than offset by seasonally lower sales volumes and higher fee manufacturing cost due to reduced production volume.", "EBITDA for the distribution business declined $6 million compared with the third quarter, but improved by $5 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2014, the wood product segments achieved over $100 million of benefit from operational excellence initiatives including delivering on our commitment to improved EBITDA and engineered wood products and distribution about $30 million to $40 million in each business.", "We've made good progress, but much more work remains to be done, as we continue our focus on operational excellence in 2015. We have committed to deliver an additional $25 million to $30 million of operational excellence from our lumber business, $10 million to $15 million from OSB, $15 million to $20 million in engineered wood products EBITDA and $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA from distribution.", "Let me know turn to cellulose fibers, Charts 9 and 10. Cellulose fibers contributed $87 million to earnings, an increase of $28 million compared with the third quarter. Fluff pulp markets remain strong in the fourth quarter and average pulp price realizations increased. Maintenance cost at our liquid packaging board facility declined substantially and production increased volume completion of extended outage that occurred primarily in the third quarter.", "As anticipated, liquid packaging board realization declined in the fourth quarter due to a temporary shift in mix, as we restarted the facility. Shipment volumes for that product also declined as result of slowdown associated with the West Coast port labour disputes.", "The Cellulose fibers business finished the year with strong operational performance with several mills setting annual records for uptime, productivity and quality. The business generated nearly $30 million of operational excellence improvements in 2014 and is targeting another $25 million to $30 million in 2015. As I wrap up this morning, let me touch briefly on SG&A. At the end of 2014, we had achieved our $75 million run rate reduction targets.", "Moving forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to simply and reduce cost to ensure that we have the appropriate cost structure require to win. I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook.", "Patty Bedient", "Thanks, Doyle. Good morning, everybody. The outlook for the first quarter of 2015 is summarized on Chart 12. I will begin with discussion with Timberlands. Fee harvest in the left is anticipated to increase seasonally. Western domestic prices are expected to move higher and we are shifting supply into those markets.", "Japanese volume will likely decrease due to the softer overall Japanese housing demands and seasonal weather conditions. Sales realizations for China logs are expected to decrease somewhat, but the impact softer prices is being partially offset by lower freight cost. Inventories at Chinese ports have been declining; the take away has not yet been strong enough to bring balances to normal levels.", "Demand is not expected to tick up until after the lunar holiday. Logging and road cost should decrease in the quarter, as the results of harvesting lower elevation sites and less road construction activity. In the South, we expect fee harvest to decline seasonally. We anticipate slightly stronger pricing, although realizations will likely be flat due to a somewhat smaller log size.", "Earnings from non-strategic land sales are anticipated at around $10 million compared to $3 million in Q4. We expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be significantly higher than the fourth quarter and up slightly from the first quarter of 2014. In wood product, we anticipate higher sales volumes in Q1 compared to Q4 due to seasonal improvement and demand slowly improving housing markets.", "Fee increase in single-family starts, which improves by almost 8% in December on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to a year ago, is a positive sign. Channel inventories are very lean so assuming a more normal strain [ph] buildings season we should see uptick in pricing.", "Prices in lumber and OSB however have decreased since year-end, but we expect realizations to improve as we progress further into the first quarter. Average realizations for engineered wood products are anticipated to decrease slightly due to product mix. However this decrease should be more than offset, by higher sales volumes. Log costs are expected to increase while manufacturing unit cost should be lower on higher production volume.", "Resin cost should also decrease as a result of low oil prices. Overall, we expect earnings in our wood product segment to increase significantly in the first quarter compared to the fourth. In cellulose fibers, day supply of global softwood inventory has increased to 31 days as of year-end, which is above normal levels. The combination of a stronger dollar and the usual seasonal slowdown in demand is likely to negatively affect full pricing.", "We also expect to incur higher maintenance expense this quarter as our largest fluff mill takes it plants maintenance shutdown. Sales realizations for liquid packaging are expected to increase this quarter compared to Q4, due to a more normal sales mix. The problems encountered as a result of the West Coast port slowdown have continued into this quarter.", "So far this quarter, we have scheduled 13 days of downtime at our Longview liquid packaging board facility due to the port situation. Although negotiations are underway with the federal mediator the issues have yet to be resolved. In addition to downtime, we are also incurring additional dollars for increased freight and warehousing.", "We expect overall earnings in cellulose fibers segment to be significantly lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and likely more comparable to the first quarter of 2014. Chart 11 shows the detail of unallocated items. Earnings in Q4 were negatively affected as unallocated items increased by approximately $23 million in Q4 compared to Q3.", "The largest increase was the change for profit and inventory in LIFO, which accounted for $14 million of the difference. Higher share-based compensation as a result of the increase in the stock price during the quarter accounted for an additional $8 million of the difference. Referring to Chart 13, I will catch on some overall financial comments.", "Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $304 million. Major uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $124 million dividend payments for preference and common stock of $174 million and share repurchases of approximately $80 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to just over $200 million or approximately 30% of our current authorization.", "We ended the year, with total shares outstanding approximately of 524 million shares down from approximately 584 million at the beginning of the year. The divestiture of our home building business in the third quarter of last year resulted in retiring approximately 59 million shares. Total capital expenditures for the full year of 2014 including reforestation was $395 million for 2015, we are expecting expenditures in the range of $480 million to $500 million consistent with the guidance we gave at our investor meeting, this past December.", "I'll now wrap up with an update on the status of our retirement benefit plans. The unfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post-employment retirement plans increased by approximately $820 million as of the end of 2014 compared to 2013. This increase in unfunded status was primarily driven by the implementation of new mortality table and decreasing discount rate.", "The updated mortality table accounted for approximately $400 million of a deficient increase. And the majority of the remaining change was due to decreasing the discount rates by approximately 80 basis points for both the U.S. and Canadian plants. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2014 and we don't anticipate any cash contributions for that plan in 2015.", "Cash paid for other pension and post-retirement benefits in 2014 was $101 million. We expect total spending in 2015 to be approximately $90 million. Our primary contributions in 2015 will again be for our Canadian plants for approximately $40 million with the remainder going to pay for benefits under our supplemental pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, none of which are separately funded.", "Chart 15 details pension and postretirement benefit plan expense from continuing operations by segment. For 2014, the full year net to zero. Pension and post retirement plan expense for 2015 is estimated to be approximately $40 million. The increased expense is driven by the adoption of the new mortality table and decrease discount rate. Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and I look forward to your questions.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Patty. In 2014, we demonstrated our commitment to driving shareholder value by improving performance through operational excellence and returning cash to shareholders. As we enter 2015, our priorities remain unchanged. We remain relentlessly focused on driving operational excellence to the fully capitalized on our improving markets and deliver value to our shareholders and wit that; I'd like to open up the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.", "Patty Bedient", "Good morning, Mark.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Wilde", "I wondered, if the two of you could talk a little bit about the impact of FX move across your overall portfolio, you made a couple of references to this in the commentary already this morning.", "Doyle Simons", "So, Mark let me talk generally about the effect of the stronger dollar across our businesses and then, Patty to fill in any of the details, but just generally you know stronger dollars generally is not a positive for Weyerhaeuser in terms of Japanese logs, what we seen is the demand is not been affected by the strong dollar as I referenced and Patty referenced in our comment, but if it continues, it could have potentially affect our price.", "In terms of Chinese logs, what's happened there, weak Rouble is making Russian logs less expensive than U.S. logs that of course reduces the price that the Chinese are willing to pay. Now with that said, as you very well know there is a practical limit on just how much Russia can provide and the other thing, we are at prices are not at desirable levels. We are able to redirect some of our logs to domestic markets there, in those domestic markets are holding up very well.", "In terms of wood products, the Canadian lumber mills are benefitting from the higher margins on shipments to the U.S. overall and then on Cellulose fibers as Patty alluded to the strong dollar at this point is not effected demand, but we do anticipate lower prices due to considerable pressure from Fluff pulp's customer primarily in Europe and currently India's K prices are under some pressure.", "So that's kind of the big picture impact of what's happening because of the stronger dollar.", "Patty Bedient", "Sure, the only other thing that I would add, I think Doyle really went through all of the businesses, I would just call your attention to Chart 11 that I talked to in my comments and you notice there, that there is an FX loss both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, that's really a function of U.S. Dollar denominated debt that it held by our Canadian subsidiaries.", "So as the Canadian Dollar depreciates as it did, again the fourth quarter that takes more Canadian Dollar pay off that loan, so that's what generates both of that loss there. Now as you look forward into Q1, the Canadian Dollar to-date, I think has depreciated even more than it did in the fourth quarter, but that would be driven ultimately by whatever the exchange rate as of the end of the quarter.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay and Patty if I could ask just one follow-on, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about sort of that big cash position you're sitting on, at the rationale for holding so much and kind of tied with that, how you think about the completing the remaining share repurchase authorization, you have about $500 million out there, yet.", "Patty Bedient", "Yes, so we are very committed to completing that authorization and we have a little under $500 million left to go, the other thing I would say, is that we think, we should have a cash balance somewhere between $300 million and $500 million. So we do have significant cash yet to create additional value for shareholders and we'll be talking about that, as we go into 2015 and have been discussing that, but I really don't have anything more to add. In terms of what we would use that for, other than just to reiterate that our priorities for capital allocation are first and foremost concerning cash to shareholders, investing in our businesses and maintaining our appropriate capital structure and to that end, I should probably add that.", "In January, we did receive an upgrade in our investments rating to BBB from BBB minus from S&P. So I think our capital structure is in good shape.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey good morning, this is actually John Babcock [ph] sitting in for George. How are you doing today?", "Doyle Simons", "Good, how are you this morning?", "Unidentified Analyst", "I'm doing very well, I just I know you talked a little bit earlier about the performance improvement and for as far as, Doyle if you could discuss, how everything is going on in that front, especially in 4Q and additionally are there any segment performance goals that are looking more difficult to achieve than when you presented back in December.", "And then lastly and the with the G&A expense reduction the fourth quarter, what was that ultimately focused?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, so in terms of OpEx targets, we continue to make progress in fourth quarter, 2014 and ended up essentially in line with what we laid out at our December, 9 presentation. So we're encouraged by the progress, we continue to make. In terms of 2015, as we specifically laid out on December 9, we think there is a lot of additional opportunity. We identified $20 million to $30 million of additional OpEx opportunity in Timberlands, another $20 million to $25 million in lumber, $10 million to $15 million in OSB.", "In ELP, here again the targeted is improving. EBITDA and that's $15 million to $20 million of EBITDA improvement in $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA improvement in distribution business and then $30 million to $35 million in cellulose fibers. So overall, very encouraged by the progress we're making, but still as I mentioned in my comments still a lot of work to do in front of us, but we are very focused on getting that to bottom line in 2015.", "Regarding your SG&A comment, our question if you will re-ask that, so make sure I'm more responsive to your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was just wondering, it looks like G&A expense to come down in the fourth quarter and I was just wondering ultimately, what drove that?", "Doyle Simons", "When we laid out our SG&A target back at the end of 2013, we said it would take a balance of 2014 to get it fully implemented. So we continue to make progress in the fourth quarter and about end of the fourth quarter, we were at the run rate of above $75 million in terms of our SG&A targets.", "So encouraged by the progress, we made there and as I mentioned we've achieved that target, but we'll constantly be looking for opportunities to make sure we had the appropriate cost structure going forward.", "Patty Bedient", "You know, actually as you look at Q3 to Q4. Q4 is up over Q3 and that's really just a function of some of the timing that happened with year-end as well as the additional item in unallocated as I spoke about share-based comp etc., but as Doyle said we feel very confident about that $75 million reduction run rate.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, good. Thank you for the colour there and then next, I guess before I pass it on, I was just wondering on the cellulose fibers front. First of all, it looked like liquid packaging realizations were down a little bit in 3Q and I was wondering, if most of that was seasonal nature or if there is any impact ultimately from the port disruption and then on top of that, how are the mills performing on the 18-month payment schedule?", "Patty Bedient", "Well, as it relates to the liquid packaging realization, the decrease in the fourth quarter wasn't driven by the port disruption. It was driven by the fact that we had, we were bringing up Longview liquid packaging as a result of the extended outage that we had in Q3. So it's just a little mix of lower grade board in the start-up of that facility coming up from the outage.", "You'll see in Q1 as I referenced in my comment that the tails realizations will increase in the first quarter more consistent to where we were on the more normal sales mix. So the fourth quarter decrease is really just a mix issue from the start off the machine.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great and then on the maintenance schedule briefly.", "Patty Bedient", "Yes on the 18 month schedule we are on track fully implemented for that. You know it will vary from year-to-year as 18 months, but we're pretty much on schedule to do that. As I mentioned, our largest fluff mill goes down this quarter. So that's our maintenance outage that we have in the Q1.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thanks for the colour. I'll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you was hoping to get a bit more colour on your encouraging comments on wood products prices expected to go higher as the quarter progresses and maybe, it's just kind of contextual, why they had been weak quarter-to-date and what you think and what degree of confidence, do you have, indeed they're going to turn?", "Doyle Simons", "Mark as you know predicting prices is always difficult, currently as we alluded to lumber prices are down slightly versus the fourth quarter average and OSB prices are down about $5 versus the fourth quarter average. We in talking to customers understand that, inventory levels are very lean. We also believe as we said, the housing is going to continue to improve. So our thought is as we move into closer to the stronger seasonal period that we will see a rally in lumber and OSB prices as we move throughout this quarter.", "So our comments to your point, our prediction regarding significant improvements in earnings in wood products in first quarter versus fourth quarter are dependent on pricing, but we do believe our crystal ball tells us that, we will see higher prices as we move through the quarter in wood products, but time will tell.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you and do you have any view as to what's been frustrating prices of late, there is some weather related issues or is there, just I mean, obviously seasonally it's not a great time, but any added colour you might have that anything unusual going on or just part of the seasonal process?", "Doyle Simons", "I think it's mostly the seasonal process, Mark. You know there have been some weather related events I don't need to tell you all, the north you all lived through one earlier this week. So I think there have been some isolated weather incidents, so far we haven't had the type of weather overall, that we had last year first quarter.", "So I think it's mostly seasonal, I think it is, some people being very conservative on their buying as I said, inventory levels throughout the system are very lean and that's part of why we believe that prices are going to rally because as demand does pick up, as we get to closer to this spring building period.", "We believe it's not to take a lot of pick up and demand to have an impact on pricing moving forward.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay, that necessarily don't make sense and just lastly, as you think about the dividend this year. Can you kind of remind us, what the key metrics you'd be looking at that would determine any action you might want to take on the dividend later in the year?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, let me just make a general comment about the dividend, you know it goes back to our overall leverage we pulled in and we clearly understand that the capital allocation is a key lever to driving shareholder value. You know as we've consistently said over our number one priorities in terms of capital allocation returning cash to shareholders through growing and sustainable dividend.", "As you know, we increased our dividend by over 30% in 2014 and I'll just tell you, we'll be working with our board later this year to determine the appropriate dividend level going forward. We have given general and I reference it as general guideline of 75% of that over a cycle in terms of dividend level, but again that's just a guideline but we do in fact understand the importance of growing our dividend and that's something we intend to do, continue to do going forward.", "Mark Weintraub", "And would it be fair to say, that you'd consider 2015 at least the way it looks out to be, not an above average year given that housing is still at fairly depressed levels or?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, that's a fair comment. I mean, as we said we anticipate housing this year will be north of 1.1, but that's still a long way from kind of average 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6. So I would agree with your commentary.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mark Connelly", "Thank you, two things. Doyle. First, how are you thinking about the relative value of U.S. versus non-U.S. Timberlands acquisitions? And then secondly, as you think about the targets you're setting for wood products for 2015 is the emphasis different than it was in 2014. I'm just curious because you achieved a lot so fast in those businesses and I'm wondering, if you got to do something different to get to next layer up.", "Doyle Simons", "So Mark in terms of the relative value of U.S. versus non-U.S. timberlands you know as we've said before, we look at all opportunities to grow our Timberlands both domestic and non-domestic. I will tell you, I think our bigger opportunity is going forward probably be in the U.S. we will look internationally I think one things we would be sure and do when we look internationally is, risk adjust based on the international exposure and we'll continue to that going forward.", "As you know, we have a very good plantation position in Uruguay. Those trees are we have a very good team there, those trees are very well positioned and growing really fast and those markets continue to develop over there, but as I tell you, we'll look both, but I think our bigger opportunities to grow our timberlands will be domestic going forward.", "In terms of our wood products, operational excellence targets. Mark, thanks for the comment. We did made good progress in 2014, but if that's it. We still got a lot of work to do in that business. Now I'm not going to tell you, it's going to be easy. Yes you continue to make progress on these. You kind of got some of the low hanging, so you've got it remain very focused on delivering that to the bottom line, that's why we set very specific targets and have very specific plans on how we're going to get there, both from the sales perspective as well as the cost perspective.", "So we are very focused on pulling every lever that we can pull to continue to drive OpEx improvements in the wood products business and are confident, we're going to reach the targets that we set out in 2015, but your point. I mean, it will get harder as we move forward, but I'm confident that we have the team and the focus to accomplish the goals that we set forth.", "Mark Connelly", "Thank you.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gail Glazerman", "Hi, good morning.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Gail.", "Patty Bedient", "Good morning, Gail.", "Gail Glazerman", "I guess, just could I go back to some of the comments about currency and how that might flow into some of the market. Have you seen, can you give any sense of magnitude to the shift that you might have seen in Russia and maybe more detail. Have you seen any signs of Canadian lumber and being redirected from China into the U.S. then if so, any concerns if that might affect some of the western market?", "Doyle Simons", "Gail, as you would expect it's hard to know exactly what's happening in Russia situation. Clearly we are hearing and seeing that there is more logs coming from Russia into China. I think most of that's in northern china, as I understand it. So I think depending on what happens to rule that something, that continue but as outlined there are some practical limits based on just how much you can comment just on the infrastructure challenges, that Russia has had historically and we believe, will continue to have going forward. Patty, do you have any thoughts on the Canadian question and any redirects some lumber coming from anything going to China that's been redirected otherwise?", "Patty Bedient", "I think that is something that, is happening we haven't seen a big company lumber volumes overall again. So I think the extent that we'll see it more as bringing building season continue. So it will be something that will impact us going forward. We do have some Canadian operations ourselves as well and Gail, you referenced the western prices, I think that's also Canadian lumber coming in, puts pressure on the U.S. South as well, but so far it's not been, a huge piece.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay, can you give any insights on to how your oil and gas income might be impacted by the recent collapse in oil prices?", "Doyle Simons", "And so let me give you a couple of sensitivities to that, I think we've done some work on that exact issue. So as you think about oil and gas prices and specifically oil prices going down there is some give and take as you would expect, but as we think about sensitivity specifically to diesel prices and how that slows through, I would tell you that we think there's probably $4 million to $5 million benefit in our earnings in fourth quarter, 2014 as a result of lower diesel prices and that's probably $2 million to $3 million in Timberlands, a $2 million in Timberlands, $2 million in wood products and maybe a $1 million in Cellulose fibers.", "Going forward, we would tell you that every roughly $0.10 decline in diesel prices flowing it through the system would result in somewhere in the $5 million benefit again with the relative ratios kind of like outlined earlier in terms of various businesses. So in annual basis, every $0.10 reduction in diesel prices will have a bottom line $5 million impact.", "Now, there are some offset as you just alluded to, one of them is, we continue to face increasing base rates for trucks and rail carriers as those continue to be tight, so that will somewhat offset some of the benefits, I just outlined and then to your point. If oil prices remained at the levels that they're currently, it will take a little time, but that would have a negative impact on our mineral income going forward. Just how much is hard to know, we haven't seen a big impact so far, but again if oil prices stay, 50 or south of 50 that would have some impact going forward as we continue to look at ways to maximize the value from our mineral resources.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay, thank you and just one last quick one. Patty, can you spot us or give us any perspective on how much pulp maintenance will be in the first quarter?", "Patty Bedient", "I think that will have an additional in the fourth quarter somewhere, I would expect around $10 million to $15 million in additional maintenance expense. We'll have some decrease as a result of the effect of less productivity because of maintenance. You know as I said, as you think about the overall earnings for the pulp segment or say about fiber segment, it's a little difficult to project.", "So we try to give you a little more colour in that, we said it would be significantly lower than the fourth quarter, but probably comparable to the first quarter of 2014 which I think was somewhere a little bit north of 50, maybe 54.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.", "James Armstrong", "Good morning, this is James Armstrong sitting in for Chip.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, James.", "Patty Bedient", "Morning, James.", "James Armstrong", "First question is, in wood products with oil prices down significantly. How much impact have you seen in resin and chemical cost so far and could you remind us of the cost buckets for that business?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, so James the sensitivities that I just outlined for Gail, that we just outlined for Gail in terms of diesel prices includes the improvements in resin, but you're exactly right that's where the biggest opportunity is in terms of the lower oil prices is in the resin that we buy for OSB and ELP businesses. So the biggest component of what I just outlined is prices as oil prices move down, resin prices are moving down and the sensitivity I gave earlier is making the correlation between diesel and resin and then flowing that through to the bottom line.", "James Armstrong", "Okay, that's also lot and then switching gears. Any chance to retire debt in the next year, I was just wondering if there are any lockups or what's going on the?", "Patty Bedient", "Sure as you think about the debt, we don't have any maturity due until 2017 and for us to retire that debt in terms of premiums we would have to pay really don't make it very economics to do that, depending upon the issues, it's probably premium of somewhere between 75%, 30% slot. So we do continue to look at it, but it doesn't really seem to make a lot of sense to us at this point.", "James Armstrong", "Perfect and then lastly, could you just give us a update on what you expect the 2015 tax rate to be?", "Patty Bedient", "Sure, the tax rate always is dependent upon the mix of weak income which the tax rate is zero and GRS income which is be somewhere around 33%. So there are two things that drive that, one is rate overall which is dependent upon the mix, but we would expect that we'd beat somewhere around 18% to 20%.", "James Armstrong", "Okay, that helps. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Linton [ph] with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, thanks good morning.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Tyler [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was just wondering, in the west for Timberlands I know it's still early, but do you think domestic demand at this point is still strong enough to offset the weaker demand that you're seeing sort of the export markets as this time?", "Doyle Simons", "As we talked about at least in the first quarter, we anticipate that we will have higher earnings in Timberlands and clearly a component of the higher earnings versus the fourth quarter Tyler [ph] our higher price and that's primarily due to domestic prices being higher as you just alluded to and some mix issue. So we'll see how it plays out going forward, but as we said domestic prices are in good shape and we think that it continue, we'll just have to see what happens in terms of, I think the biggest challenge as we talked about in the Chinese markets will get through the lunar holiday, as we talked about inventory has come down and not back to where normal is, but they have come down. So our guess is, those markets will stabilize in the second half of the year as well.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay then I was, in terms of your export log volumes. I guess China has slipped they had been kind of pulling around 30% of your volumes and they were around 25% this quarter. Is that anything, is that like a deliberate effort on your part just given the weakness over there? Or really that's just function of demand from China has just slowed lot more than the demand, slowed out of Japan?", "Doyle Simons", "I would say both, Tyler [ph]. I mean part of it is, we have seen a little bit of fall off in demand in China as we alluded too, but we also made the conscious decision to redirect some of those log domestically because of the strong prices that we're seeing on the west coast. So it's the combination of both things.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got you and I think it's finally engineered wood products side, I think you've had two quarters of pretty significant production declines. Have these been more sort of temporary cuts and do you think volumes are little bit down more towards the level that \u2013we saw in the first half of 2014 or dipping in the volumes to kind of grow more in line off of this lower base, any thoughts on that going forward?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, I think the declines one of them was kind of, it happened because of the second or third was, as we put in a price increase and moving some volume forward to the second versus the third and then the follow-up in the fourth quarter from our perspective was purely seasonal. So as we move into the stronger seasonal period first quarter and then second quarter, we would anticipate a nice rebound in volumes in our engineered wood products business.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Very great, thanks so much.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "Paul Quinn", "Yes, thanks very much and good morning.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Quinn", "Yes, just two easy questions today. Just one is, you referenced opportunities in Timberland in North America, just wondering if you could comment on that competitive landscape out there, whether you're looking at bigger things or smaller things?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, so as you know it's been pretty active in terms of activity in both the south and the west. In terms of the competitive landscape, I still think there is a lot of money out there that is looking to invest in this asset class. In terms of the way we look at it, our key criteria or we clearly are looking for opportunities that generate appropriate returns and cash flow both short-term and long-term.", "We look for opportunities where we can strengthen our access to strategically important markets for us or move into new markets, that we may not be in although we are in most markets, as you know. Also looking for opportunities where we can get synergies and I think Longview is a very good example of where we were able to do some things to get some mix synergies and then finally to your point.", "We are looking for scale opportunity. Now that doesn't mean, we won\u2019t do some small deals and we're always in the market doing some small deals, we're really looking for some scale opportunities to continue to grow our timberland, if we can find those right opportunities going forward. So that's kind of the way, we think about it.", "Paul Quinn", "Okay, great and then turning over to the SoftWood Lumber Agreement. One of your competitors on a timber REIT side, this week said that he talked to Softwood Lumber Agreement served its purpose and really no longer needed. I'm just wondering what Weyerhaeuser's position is, are you happy with the current agreement, do you want to see higher import duties or is it the latter that no longer needed?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, I wouldn't say some type of agreement is no longer needed. As you know, as we've talked about, the agreement set to expire later this year. I can tell you there is a lot of discussion from folks on both sides of the border discussing options for renewing that agreement and also to tell you that we are very actively involved in those discussions.", "Paul Quinn", "Okay that's all I had, thanks a lot. Thanks.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Hi, I've a question on cellulose fibers. Given we've seen a slowing of emerging market economies and a very strong dollar. I was wondering, as we start the year putting aside the west coast port issues. Are you seeing any change in customer buying behaviour or any slowing of demand for fluff and then a related question. You have a competitor who's talked about converting a fair amount of new fluff capacity next year and I think you've debottlenecked some capacity as well.", "I was just wondering, how you're thinking about the fluff supply-demand balance over the next year or so?", "Patty Bedient", "Sure, Anthony. You know as it relates to demand for the product. Demand has continued to be very strong having said that, I think that we will likely have some downward pressure potentially on price, just given what's happening with the economies in Asia as well as just currency flows. So far we've been very pleased with the demand outlook for fluff, it is thus continue to grow, but depending upon what's happened with some of those developing economies, we could see some softening a little bit there, but really haven't seen it after a point.", "As it relates to conversion, I wouldn't want speculate too much because it will take some time for any conversion to come in to place and then it will just be a function of what the overall market is at that point in time. One thing I would say is that, as we talked about before, the higher quality fluff product which is where we play primarily does have a consumer product companies like Procter & Gamble who are pretty picky about the quality.", "So not only does it, it take time to actually do the conversion to the product, it also takes time to qualify that product. So it's something we are watching very carefully and being very thoughtful as we go forward, but the current state is that the demand, which is pretty solid.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay, that's very helpful and then maybe just switching to wood products. You\u2019ve made some very impressive performance improvements in distribution this year or last year. I think you referenced to $20 million to $30 million improvement target for 2015. Can you drill down a little bit on the kind of the leverage you're going to pull to drive that EBITDA improvement and distribution this year and can you talk a little bit about the strategic importance of distribution as part of the broader wood products portfolio?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, so in terms of the leverage that we're going to pull. There seems to be the same levers that we pulled in 2014, it's just continuing to be focused on that. As Cathy Slater talked about it in our December 9 presentation it's really a focus on what we call the five S's which is sourcing, selling, stocking, storing and shipping. So it's basically the blocking and tackling of making sure we're continuing to do things to drive down our cost structure where it needs to be and then making sure we are doing things on the sell side to maximize the profit margins of what we run through our distribution system.", "In terms of how we think about distribution as I've said before \u2013 that\u2019s a business where frankly we've underperformed for a number of years. We needed to show that we could make dramatic improvements in that versus in terms of overall EBITDA improvement and where we stack up competitively. We started to do that in 2014, but still a lot of work remains to be done in terms of how we think about it going forward, that's business we need to show that we can win by out-executing the competition and generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital over a cycle and that's what we are focused on doing currently.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Doyle Simons", "Great. Thank you. Okay, so I understand it that was our last question. So I would just like to end by saying, thank you everybody for joining in this morning. More importantly thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.", "Patty Bedient", "Thanks everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's conference c all.

Cumulative repurchase at quarter end totaled $610 million, as we near completion of our existing $700 million authorization.", "I will begin this discussion of our business results with some brief comments about the housing market. Housing indicators remain choppy and the spring building season was slow to gather momentum in the second quarter as weeks of heavy rain and flooding in the South hampered building activity.", "However, markets gained momentum late in the quarter as the weather abated and our outlook for 2015 remains unchanged at approximately 1.1 million housing starts, which represents a 10% improvement compared with 2014.", "We continue to be optimistic about the longer-term prospect for housing as rising employment, strong consumer confidence, historically low mortgage rates and signs of increased participation by first time home buyers should support continuing improvement in the U.S. housing market. In addition, builder sentiment in July was at the highest level in 10 years and our customers continue to tell us they expect increased housing activity in the second half of the year.", "Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, charts three to five. Timberlands contributed $127 million to the second quarter earnings, compared with $162 million in the first quarter. Lower average sales realizations for western logs and lower earnings from timberlands dispositions more than offset seasonally higher sales volumes.", "In the West, export log prices remained under pressure due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. However, export volumes increased substantially, compared with first quarter due to seasonally improved demand from our Japanese and Chinese customers.", "Domestic log sales realizations declined throughout the quarter, as log markets remained well supplied due to favorable market conditions in the first half of the year. In the South, fee harvest increased seasonally as we were able to flex harvest settings around the second quarter's extreme wet weather. Average sales realizations for Southern logs were comparable to the first quarter.", "Second quarter included earnings of $5 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, a reduction of $12 million, compared with the first quarter. The Timberlands business continues to benefit from operational excellence initiatives and remains on track to meet its OpEx targets for 2015.", "Wood Products, charts six and seven. Wood Products contributed $71 million to the second quarter earnings, an improvement of $9 million compared with the first quarter. EBITDA increased to $98 million. Improved sales volumes and reduced operating cost enabled the business to overcome lower average realizations for lumber and oriented strand board.", "In Lumber, EBITDA declined $6 million, compared with the first quarter, a 5% decline in average sales realizations was mostly offset by seasonally higher sales volumes, lower Western log costs and operational excellence initiatives to reduce manufacturing cost.", "In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $4 million due to a 3% decline in average sales realizations. I was particularly pleased with the performance of engineered wood products in the quarter, as we reported EBITDA of $38 million, an increase of $12 million compared with the first quarter. Sales volume rose seasonally across all product lines and per unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher production volume and operational excellence initiatives.", "EBITDA for the distribution business increased by $5 million, compared with the first quarter due to improved sales volumes, higher product margins and lower overhead cost.", "Our Wood Products businesses remained relentlessly focused on operational excellence. Lumber and OSB are on track to achieve their 2015 targets. Engineered wood products is tracking significantly above its full-year EBITDA improvement target, up $26 million year-to-date compared with 2014.", "And our distribution business has been challenged by the severe weather in some of its key markets in the first half of the year and has work to do to achieve its target. However, this business is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanded building activity we expect during the second half of 2015.", "Cellulose Fibers, charts 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $27 million to earnings, compared with $33 million in the first quarter. Pulp market stabilized during the second quarter as global inventories declined to more balanced levels. Average pulp realizations were down compared with the first quarter.", "As expected, maintenance expense increased significantly in the second quarter, as we completed a planned extended outage at our Flint River, Georgia mill. The outage included scheduled maintenance and installation of energy-related capital improvements. The West Coast port disruption resulted in approximately $8 million in lingering logistics costs in the second quarter, but we anticipate minimal effects going forward.", "The Cellulose Fibers business made good progress on operational excellence initiatives in the second quarter, including the successful startup of a turbine generator that significantly reduces energy cost at our Flint River mill. This business remains on track to achieve its 2015 operational excellence target.", "I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our third quarter outlook.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the third quarter is summarized on chart 13, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.", "In the West, sales realizations for export logs to Japan are expected to improve slightly, due to increased housing demand. Although China inventories have decreased from earlier in the year, they remain at above-normal levels, putting continued pressure on prices. Domestic log realizations are anticipated to increase as a result of constrained supply due to fire-related harvest restriction. Fee harvest volumes are expected to decrease accordingly.", "In the South, average sales, log sales realizations are anticipated to be comparable to Q2. Fee harvest volumes are expected to increase on a slightly lower grade mix as Q3 typically carries a greater percentage of thinning volume.", "Silviculture costs are anticipated to increase both seasonally and because some activities had to be deferred from Q2 as a result of wet weather. Earnings from non-strategic land sales are projected to be around $10 million, compared to $5 million in Q2. Overall earnings in our Timberlands segment are expected to be slightly lower in Q3, compared to Q2.", "Turning to Wood Products. Although, lumber and oriented strand board prices have decreased during the month of July, the average sales realizations for this month are still higher than the Q2 averages. We expect prices for both lumber and OSB to increase in the remainder of the quarter from today's level. We anticipate average sales realizations for engineered wood products in the third quarter to be comparable to the second quarter.", "Sales volumes are anticipated to be seasonally higher across most product lines. Western log costs are expected to be modestly higher than Q2. We will be taking some annual maintenance downtime in our engineered wood products facilities, which will negatively affect manufacturing costs for the quarter. We expect continued improvement in the results of our distribution business.", "Overall, we anticipate that third quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment will be higher than the second quarter, but likely lower than the third quarter of last year.", "Moving to the Cellulose Fibers business, global softwood pulp inventory levels decreased during the second quarter, and we were basically in balance at the end of the quarter. However, because the industry typically plans fewer maintenance outages in the third quarter, combined with uncertainty around demand from China, inventory levels could tick up leading to some softness in pulp prices in the third quarter. We expect higher sales volumes to partially offset the potential effect of lower sales realization.", "We anticipate substantial cost improvement in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we had 46 maintenance-related outage days. And this quarter, we have only minimal days planned. As a result, we will have lower maintenance expense and higher productivity.", "In addition, now that the West Coast port dispute has been resolved, we do not anticipate a repeat of the $8 million negative effect that we experienced in Q2. Overall, third quarter results in our Cellulose Fibers segment should significantly increase, compared to the second quarter and exceed the third quarter earnings of last year.", "Chart 10, summarizes the results of unallocated items. Before special items, total cost decreased by just over $60 million. The largest item making up this variance was foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar appreciated from approximately $0.79 at the end of the first quarter to $0.81 at the end of the second quarter. For modeling purposes, every penny in the exchange rate is roughly $4 million on a pre-tax basis.", "The other large item was the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. This item is difficult to predict, as it fluctuates based on the level and mix of inventory from quarter-to-quarter. However, we do not expect the change of this magnitude in the third quarter.", "Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, beginning with chart 11. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $366 million or an increase of $289 million, compared to the first quarter. In addition to increased earnings, large positive variances included lower working capital, and lower interest payments, compared to the first quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $108 million, bringing our year-to-date expenditures to $197 million. We continue to expect total expenditures for the full year to approximate $500 million. We do not have any debt maturities until 2017 and have no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion line of credit. As detailed on chart 12, during the second quarter, we used $154 million to repurchase our common stocks. And at the end of Q2, we had approximately $90 million remaining under our existing authorization.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Patty. The housing market continues to gather momentum and building activity is increasing, although, it has come this year in fits and starts. Looking forward, we are well positioned to capitalize on its improvement. And we remain relentlessly focused on driving value for shareholders through operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation.", "Now, with that, I'd like to open up the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thanks a lot. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. Doyle, you'd made a comment, or Patty, that you are expecting lumber and OSB prices to pick up as the quarter progresses. I was curious what informs that view, whether it's a sense of where inventories are in the channel? Is at sense that demand is going to be getting better? What would be the drivers that you are expecting to help us see lumber and OSB start moving in the right direction?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Mark, it's a combination of those factors. As I mentioned in my prepared comments and talking to customers, they continue to be very optimistic about housing activity. In fact, I was talking to Adrian Blocker just this morning. He was with customers as recently as yesterday, and just very optimistic about activity out there. In addition, in terms of inventories, as you mentioned, I would tell you inventories are fairly lean at this point in time.", "So, I think what's happened is there's been a confluence of events from the supply side, Mark, as you're very well aware of in terms of the Canadian dollar, and that's resulted in additional volume coming into the U.S. The weakness in the export \u2013 Asian export markets has resulted in an increase coming in to the U.S. That, at a time when we had a delay in the spring building season, all resulted in prices having some pressure on them. I think as demand continues to improve, supply and demand will get back in balance, and hopefully, we will see some improvement in lumber and OSB prices as we move through the balance of the quarter.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. And one quick follow-up. Do you have thoughts on the potential expiration of the softwood lumber agreement and what type of implications that might or might not have for lumber markets as we go forward?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, in terms of the softwood lumber agreement, as we've said previously, this is an important issue to Weyerhaeuser. There's a council of industry leaders that are discussing options for renewing the agreement and Weyerhaeuser is actively participating in those discussions. And we're very hopeful that we can reach an agreement and avoid trade litigation going forward.", "In terms of the implications, if it runs out in October, Mark, there's two trains of thought. One is that when that occurs, that additional supply comes on from Canada because there won't be any tariffs in place. But there is also the thought that that will not occur because of the implications that it could potentially have in trade litigations down the road.", "So, don't know how to play out. And again, two different trains of thought, and we'll just have to see what happens if we're not able to get a resolution in place prior to that which I think everybody is working towards.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Could you talk about the movement of Western export log prices as you move through Q2 and then into July, and are you seeing any inflection point there? And then maybe just a related question. We've heard a lot about the risk of fires in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. Is that something that's actually impacting prices and volumes right now, or is that just something that we need to kind of keep an eye on in August and September?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, both important issues, and let me address each of those. In terms of export markets, let me break it down by market. In Japan, we saw prices bottom in June and prices have started to move up in July. And this has been due to the improved Japanese housing demand. And to your second question, I'll get into more details on this in just a minute, the lower log supply due to \u2013 primarily due to fire restrictions.", "In terms of what we're seeing in China, the log takeaway from Chinese ports picked up in the second quarter, but remains at relatively low levels. Log inventories \u2013 I mean, log inventories moved down to about 3.8 million cubic meters in the second quarter, but has since climbed back up just above 4 million cubic meters. And I can tell you the softwood log imports from all regions into China are down, but as I said, the inventories remain high and we think there continue to be pressure in China in terms of pricing.", "Related to that in domestic markets in the West, we think domestic prices are going to rise due to the fire season. And our volumes, as Patty mentioned, our harvest volumes are projected to be down in the third quarter versus the second because of the fire restrictions.", "Now, let me turn to the current fire situation. And I can tell you just drive around the Pacific Northwest, it's dry out there. It almost looks like you're in Arizona as opposed to the normally wet Pacific Northwest.", "In terms of what's happening, the fire season started earlier this year and at least at this point, it looks like it's going to last longer than normal. If you look at the level of rainfall, it's one of the lowest levels in the last 70 years. And I can tell you most Western acres are currently under either what's called level 2, level 3 or level 4 fire restrictions. These are restrictions that are put on placed by outside regulators.", "Just to give you a sense, level 2 requires most operations to cease by 1 PM. Level 3 requires all operations to cease by 1 PM and further restricts certain harvest activity such as using power saws and cables, cable yarding at all times. And then level 4 restrictions are complete ban on entry to the forest. Just a couple of days ago in Oregon, a level 4 restriction was put in place in portions of Oregon. There's not been a level 4 restriction in place since 1988, just to put it in context. And that restriction impacts about 15% of our Western Timberlands.", "Now, that can change overnight if we get some rain or temperatures cool down and all those things. But that is the current state. And to your question, we do anticipate lower harvest in the third quarter versus the second as a result of these fire restrictions and we'll continue to monitor them and see how they play out going forward.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Maybe just to add to that a little bit, as Doyle said, the fire restrictions or the fire concern happened earlier in the Pacific Northwest than normal. And people anticipated that this may happen in some of the drier conditions, as you heard us talk about in the second quarter, led many of the mills to, and I'm talking industry now, to put in a few more logs. So, we haven't seen closures of mills at this point because of out of log downtime because they still have some inventory of logs. But I think as we get into August and into the middle of August, we'll see more of that concern, as Doyle said, if we don't get more rain in the Pacific Northwest, which isn't the forecast as we sit here today. I think it'll be something that we'll see more in the month of August than we've seen thus far in July.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, that's very helpful detail. And then maybe just one follow-up on timberlands. During the quarter, we saw announcements from a few large timber owners that they would put large properties on the market. I wonder generally, are you seeing any change in institutional interest for timberlands? Is it becoming a little bit more of a buyer's market? Are you seeing any trends in prices changing? And is there an opportunity for Weyerhaeuser, as a buyer or a seller, especially in the South?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And so I would say overall, when you step back, Anthony, the amount of activity still is generally low in the South and the West. As you mentioned, there were some facts that came on, became available in the first half of the year. I would say, most of those have some unique challenges that people will have to work through in terms of how they're going to value those. I would say, we expect more activity in the second half of the year, and I can tell you there's still a lot of money chasing deals. So no, I don't see any downward pressure on timberland prices at this point in time.", "In terms of Weyerhaeuser specifically, as we've consistently said we're always looking to grow our timberland, but we will continue to be very disciplined and make sure any acquisition that we make meets our appropriate level of returns and drives value for our shareholder. So, we look at everything that comes across, or most everything that comes across. And we are interested in growing but we'll continue to be disciplined.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Gail.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "First, just picking up on a couple of things that have been asked, looking at the Canadian trade situation maybe shorter term tariffs are set to go down fairly significantly in August. Do you have any concerns there that that might put incremental supply in the market and weigh on pricing? If not, it doesn't look like you do, so why not?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. As we alluded to, tariffs are scheduled to go down from 15% to 5% in August. We don't anticipate that that's going to have a big impact on the supply side of the equation but I guess we'll just have to watch it together. But our sense is that it hasn't been a, the 15%, even with the 15% we've seen, we continued to see supply come in from Canada so we don't see, we don't anticipate a significant change when the tariff changes on a monthly basis.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And just quickly following up on the view on western logs and the fire restrictions, can you give maybe a sense, I mean have you started to see any tension in the markets at all yet? I appreciate what you are saying that it will play out more in August, but can you give a sense maybe your July pricing versus your second-quarter average? Has there been any movement yet?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It takes a little bit of time for that to flow through, Gail, but I don't think there's any doubt that there is tightness in the market. And that's just going to increase as these fire restrictions continue. So, as we said, as Patty said and I alluded to, both in Japan and in western domestic, we anticipate prices increasing in the third quarter versus the second. And we're starting to see signs of that.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And just switching gears to capital allocation, you have obviously exhausted basically 85% of the existing buyback authorization. Can you just give us some thoughts and perspective on how the board might be thinking about incremental allocation dividend buyback moving forward?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so in terms of capital allocation, first and foremost, our number one priority is returning cash to shareholders. As we've said, that's primarily going to be through a growing and sustainable dividend. In addition, we'll look to use share repurchase as a tool where appropriate. As we look forward, we'll continue to work with our board regarding our dividend. I can tell you, as you know, we've constantly raised our dividend over the past few years. And as I said, we'll work with our board to determine the appropriate dividend level going forward.", "In terms of share repurchase, as you said, we are approaching the completion of our $700 million authorization, and we'll work with the board on that issue going forward. As we've also said, we think long term the appropriate level of cash on our balance sheet is somewhere in the $300 million to $500 million range, and we are significantly above that at this time.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Just one quick follow-up on that. With the recent share price decline, do you think that's something that the board may kind of factor into its thinking?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think the board looks at lots of factors in determining the appropriate balance between dividends and share repurchase. And that clearly would be a factor that the board would in fact consider.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "I just wanted to come back to wood products. Your lumber EWP margins look quite good, especially relative to peers. Can you talk about what you're seeing and what has been the key driver there?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm sorry. I might have to ask you to repeat the question. You're cutting out a little bit on our end.", "Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "I'm sorry. I wanted to ask about the lumber EWP margins. They look pretty good relative \u2013 especially relative to your peers this quarter. So I just wanted to understand what has been the key driver and what you are seeing?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, in terms of lumber, we were encouraged by the margins this quarter. And I think what you saw there is a combination of OpEx efforts and lower log cost that pretty much are almost \u2013 completely offset the decline in prices in the quarter. So, we're continuing to make progress on our OpEx, and that is showing up in our bottom line. And we saw some of the benefit of that in the second quarter", "Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "That's helpful. And just one more, switching gears to timberlands. Can you talk a little bit about your offshore timberlands in Uruguay and how you think about it?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. So we have 300,000 acres of timberlands in Uruguay. It's about half pine and about half eucalyptus. I was down there not too long ago, and very fertile ground and the trees grow very quickly. So, it's been \u2013 we don't have many mature trees at this point. It's still fairly early in the rotation and we're spending a lot of time figuring out exactly the best way to monetize those trees through manufacturing going forward.", "Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And that's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes. Good morning, everyone.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Chip.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Doyle, I would imagine you and Patty, all of you all, are pretty pleased with the engineered wood products result. Would you say it's kind of gotten into the zone of where you were hoping it would be when you embarked on a lot of your initiatives a couple of years ago, and if not, how much further do you think we need to see that improve?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Thanks for your comment, Chip. And we are pleased with the progress that we've made in EWP. But we still have more work to do. But the key three \u2013 three key drivers that we've seen to get us to where we are today is continuing to reduce our controllable manufacturing costs through OpEx, some lower SG&A cost and then growing profitable sales. So, to your question, we are absolutely very pleased, our team they have done a really nice job. But we're not taking our foot off the accelerator. We're going to continue to do things to improve that business going forward.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Got you. And then when you look at the Distribution business, I know it tends to not really \u2013 it tends to always below margin, but sometimes it's hard to know what's going on below the surface. Would you say that's equally along the path as EWP is, or does it still maybe have a little bit further to go versus EWP?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. It clearly has further to go, Chip, versus EWP. So, we are making a progress there. But frankly, we're behind schedule. I can tell you a portion of that was primarily due to some adverse weather we had in some of our key markets like Texas and Denver. But get to our OpEx goals for the quarter, we're going to have to hustle. We're going to have to have good execution in the second half of the year. And we're well positioned to capitalize on markets as they continue to improve. But clearly, we're not as far along in distribution as we are in EWP and still have some work to do.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. Very helpful. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details, and congrats on the operational excellence again. I guess the first question I had, can you comment as to what roughly you would have in your guidance thus far for the third quarter for wood product pricing? Would prices have to rise above the current run rate or the \u2013 clearly the second quarter average, and if so could you put a bracket on what kind of growth rate we'd need to see in pricing from here?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "George, where we are currently is \u2013 prices are up. So, quarter-to-date, prices are up versus the second quarter average. So, lumber prices for us are up roughly $10 versus the second quarter average. And OSB prices are up roughly $5. As Patty said in her comments, we anticipate prices will move up from this point forward, but we'll all watch that together. But because of the reasons I've said earlier, primarily driven by improving demand is our best guess and it is a guess, but it's our best guess that we'll see prices move up for the \u2013 somewhat for the balance of the quarter versus where they are today. But we are currently higher than where \u2013 than the second quarter average.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Fair enough, Doyle.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. And I think the price...", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, Patty. How are you?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. When you think about prices in the month of July, they actually came down. So, we had a little bit of rally late in the second quarter in June, and then about after the 4 of July holiday, prices started to tick back down. So, the average that Doyle was giving you for July is actually a little higher than where they would be with midweek print randomly. But we do anticipate, for all the reasons that Doyle said that those prices will be going back up.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, to summarize, third quarter is a decent start on an average basis, but the markets would need to see more movement, more progress relative to what you have embedded in your guidance. Is that fair?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's generally fair. Yes.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. All right, thanks, Doyle. In terms of the mills, can you tell us where you think you are on the cost curve? Recognizing that we're not at \u2013 hopefully, at the precipice of a recession. I know one of the goals in the past has been to get all the mills in the Wood Products business, as much as possible, to cash break even so that when you do get into a downturn you won't be losing cash. So where do you stand in terms of getting the mills to where you want them to be on the cost curve and positioned both versus competitors and versus the macro?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. So, as you said, George, our goal is just as we say around here, be black at the bottom and that's the cost structure that we're putting in place in our Wood Products facilities. We've made progress but we've still got work to do. We've laid out specific OpEx targets. And like I said, we're making good progress on those, but by the end of this year, we'll met our 2015 targets but we've still got additional work that needs to be done over the next two to three years to get our cost structure where ultimately it needs to be, to be black at the bottom, fully capitalized on the this upturn and maybe most importantly outperform our competitors on an ongoing basis going forward. So, progress made, still lots of work to do.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Fair enough. Doyle, last question and then I'll turn it over. If we look at the pulp mills, and again, we're down the pike in terms of the 18-month maintenance cycle being brought in now maybe a couple of years, what continue to be the learnings that you are getting from this? How the mills come up after maintenance? Anything that you would tweak with the strategy on a going-forward basis? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. So, George, I would tell you that the 18 month outage plan has been a success for us. When you take mills down, it can be difficult to bring them back up. We saw that in the first quarter as we talked about. But that occurs whether it's down over 12 months or down every 18 month. So, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on the 18 months schedule and we think that has been a net benefit to our company and to our shareholders.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Is there a particular challenge when you go up 18 months versus 12 months, or really no difference?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know I wouldn't say there is no difference, George, but you still got to take \u2013 as you and I talked about last quarter, taking these mills down and starting them back up, there is always challenges associated with that, and it may be a little more challenging if it's 18 versus 12, but we haven't seen anything systematic or systemic that makes it harder. You just got unique challenges with each one of these mills as you take them down and bring them back up. And some of them go really, really well. And some of ours have gone well and some of them, you have challenges.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Well, thanks. Congrats \u2013 go ahead, Patty.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "George, when we look at our \u2013 and I think Flint River is a good example of that. It was not only a factor of taking a mill down for maintenance, but we were also installing some really very beneficial equipment around energy costs. And so, it's the combination of all those things. But I think it is important to your question that as we've gone through this process, there are learnings, and I would call them only tweaks that you get from just the maintenance, which is a very important piece in our Cellulose Fibers business. So, we are capitalizing on looking at the learnings as we take a mill down and bring it back up to factor that into our maintenance going forward, and that's part of our operational excellence.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thanks for the thoughts. Congrats on the quarter and good luck going forward.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, George.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mark?", "Operator", "Mark, please make sure your line is not on mute.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hello, Mark.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Why don't we take the next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yes, good morning. Thanks. I just had a question I guess lumber and OSB prices. I guess they ticked down recently. I know it's not a big decrease, but is there anything you can point to that's maybe driving that drop?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You know, I think it really is just the factors that Doyle went through. We've had weaker demand from Asia, which impacts the exports that come out of Canada. We've had some changes in currency that put some headwinds there. And then I think, notwithstanding the fact that housing has been ticking up of late in terms of people have reiterated their full-year guidance for the year. The first half was a little disappointing in terms of where we thought things would be. So, as we look at housing for the second half, our guidance really hasn't changed. And since we didn't have a great response in the first half, that would bode for the second half being better. But as Doyle said, we'll have to wait and see. There's just a lot of moving parts out there with all of this, so.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And then just, I know it's still early, but I think you mentioned CapEx of $500 million this year. Can you give a rough sense of a range where it could be for next year?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We really don't have a range for next year that we would give in terms of guidance at this point, Tyler. We'll do that as we approach year-end. But one thing that I would say about the projects that we're putting in, and the $500 million is a little higher than where we've been historically. But we've got some great Wood Products projects that are underway that I think will pay additional dividends as we look at bringing our costs down across that system. So, really excited about the projects that we are spending that money on, but a little too soon to tell you exactly what we'd be doing for next year.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then just a last question, southern seller prices I know, I think last quarter you were looking for maybe a, it was 3% to 4% increase. Prices have been generally flat. Do you think it's more realistic that prices are flat for this year?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Tyler, we still anticipate that southern prices will be up kind of in line with what they've been up over the past couple of years, which would be somewhere in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Steve.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Steve.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "So, if I'm not mistaken, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations should conclude today, and I don't think it's a highly visible piece of the puzzle, but Canada's effective ban on log exports is part of the equation. That's mainly BC, obviously. So but if BC was compelled to export logs, can you tell us how that would impact your Pacific Northwest operations?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "As we look at that, Steve, we'll just have to see how that actually plays out in terms of what the final resolution will be. So, difficult for us really to tell what that result is.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Has it been on your radar, clearly, Canada is a big supplier of sawn lumber. So, are there ports, for instance, conducive to log ships as opposed to lumber ships?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It is something that we have tracked, but it's not something that I would say we have a comment that we'd make about in terms of ports at this point.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "All right. Thank you, Patty.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thank you. Hopefully, you can hear me this time. I apologize.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We can hear you.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Go ahead.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Great. So first question is, it's around but not really about transfer pricing. I'm curious whether your internal log prices to your West Coast lumber operations were up a similar amount to your outside log sales. Obviously, there's going to be a mix and other difference. I'm just curious how they tend to track, understanding mix and geographic differences.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, Mark, just to be clear, your question is related to how we do transfer pricing to our docks?", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Well, you mentioned that external log sales realizations are up. And I'm curious whether your internal log costs are up by a similar amount, and whether those two things tend to track over time. I'm not asking whether you do transfer pricing, honestly. Obviously you do.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, they are correlated because they all come from the same geographies. There is a different mix however, as you think about what we would send exports, for example to Japan versus the grade that our domestic sawmills would use. So, directionally, they usually do track but they will not be similar absolute pricing because of the grade mix.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay, that's very helpful. It's just what I was looking for. And second quick question. Does the U.S. dollar strength increase your relative interest in overseas timberland acquisitions?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mark, as we've said before, we are looking to grow our Timberland. We think our biggest opportunities will be domestic whether it'd be in the South or the Pacific Northwest. We'll also continue to look internationally but we're going to make sure that we appropriately risk adjust any acquisition that we would make internationally. So, that's kind of generally the way we think about it. Currencies don't move up. Currency is going to move down. So, we won't overemphasize that in any decision we may make versus acquisitions.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Very helpful, Doyle. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Good morning, Doyle and Patty.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Collin.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "I guess my first question, just Patty, as it goes back to the guidance significantly increased results in the Cellulose Fibers business. I think, Patty, you indicated in the prepared remarks that would be above last year's 3Q, so could we see that bounce all the way back up to, call it, about the $90 million or so figure that you posted a few quarters last year, or is that a bit too optimistic?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You're probably just a little optimistic there, Collin. If you kind of think about guidance for the Cellulose Fibers business, we were at $27 million, I believe, in the second quarter. We've got 46 days in the second quarter and, probably, less than a handful in the third quarter. So, between the maintenance expense and better productivity as we run more days, I would say that's probably going to be around just to give you some sense around the $45-ish million number. We said we will have likely lower realizations. But I would expect that to be offset by some higher volumes as well as some additional potential for cost improvement in other ways. So, I think that will help you get a little bit in the ZIP code. I think $90 million \u2013 love to have $90 million, but that might be a little optimistic at this point.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. No. That's very helpful. And I guess also, Patty, just going back to Tyler's question, just thinking about the CapEx, I know it's obviously too early for 2016, but the comments as far as kind of the ramp-up over the last couple of years, should we view the $500 million as kind of a high-watermark, or do you think there's still the potential to see a higher number at some point as you continue to invest in your mills?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I think you would think about $500 million as being closer to the high watermark, Collin. I don't think we'd be looking at something that's significantly above that. I think last year in 2014, we were around in the $400 million, maybe $450 million. So, we have ramped that up a little bit. But I wouldn't see us being significantly above $500 million for 2016.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then I guess just the last question, kind of going back to Gail's question earlier, just about the share repurchases. One thing that surprised me a little bit during the quarter was that there was a moderation in repurchase activity relative to 1Q, particularly in context of the drop in the share price. Anything that we should read into that or any sort of restrictions on preventing you to buy back stock during a period of the quarter? Or just can you put any additional color around that?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Collin, there is nothing that should be read into that. That's just where it ended up for the quarter under our program and we'll continue to report on a quarterly basis our progress going forward.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Good luck during the quarter, guys.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, Doyle and Patty. Just a question for Doyle. You've been running Weyerhaeuser for a couple of years now, and you've had operational excellence in place for quite a bit of that time. Just wondering if you're happy with the current portfolio of assets? And besides timberlands, what business segment looks good for growth?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, Collin on \u2013 I mean Paul on your first point on OpEx, we're encouraged by the progress we've made there. Still more work to do. In terms of opportunities to grow our portfolio going forward. We've consistently said, I think now, over the last couple of years, that we think our biggest opportunity to grow will be in Timberlands. But we would look at growing other parts of our company as well, if we can find appropriate growth opportunities that meet our hurdle requirements and drive value for shareholders.", "So, that's generally how we think about growth going forward. The beauty of it is we don't have to grow to be successful. But if we \u2013 so we can be very disciplined, we have been and will continue to be. But if we can find the appropriate opportunities to grow this company, that's absolutely something we'll look to do to drive value for our shareholders going forward.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Best of luck.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Paul", "Operator", "Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Doyle for any closing remarks.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "As I understand it, that was our final question. And I would just like to thank, everybody, for joining us this morning for our call. And more importantly, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Brent, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Denise M. Merle - Senior Vice President-Human Resources & Investor Relations", "Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2015 earnings. On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings material on our website.", "I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $180 million, or $0.35 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion.", "I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance as each of our businesses capitalized on operational excellence improvements to deliver strong results despite some market and global macroeconomic headwinds.", "In addition, we continued to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We have completed the $700 million share repurchase program authorized in 2014. In August, our board supplemented this program with an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization and also increased our quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.31 per share. This illustrates our confidence in our ability to continue to execute our operational excellence initiatives and capitalize on market improvements going forward.", "I'll begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continued to advance in the third quarter following choppy activity in the first half of the year. Total housing starts as of September, has improved 18% compared with 2014, and single-family starts are up 12%. We continue to anticipate just over 1.1 million starts for 2015.", "Our customers tell us they expect strong year-in activity for as long as weather conditions remain favorable. With rising employment, strong consumer confidence, historically low mortgage rates and builder sentiment reaching all-time highs, we continue to anticipate steady improvement in the U.S. housing market.", "Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, charts two to four. Timberlands contributed $126 million to third quarter earnings, comparable to the second quarter. Strong cost controls and operational excellence initiatives offset the effect of reduced Western fee harvest volumes and lower average sales realizations for Western logs.", "As expected, Western fee harvest volumes declined by 5% compared with the second quarter due to buyer season logging constraints. This year's buyer season was exceptionally severe due to record breaking temperatures and unusually low rainfall.", "Our employees did an exceptional job of protecting our Timberlands and flexing harvest settings to adjust the changing logging constraints and market conditions. Our tree farms experienced virtually no fire damage with only about 150 of our 7 million acres affected, less than 100 of 1%.", "Average realizations for Western domestic logs improved slightly in the third quarter as fire season restrictions resulted in tighter log supplies, especially in Southern Oregon and we benefited from an improved mix.", "Turning to the export markets, Japanese demand remained strong and pricing for our Japanese logs was up slightly in the quarter. After peaking in August, log inventories at Chinese ports have declined as supply has fallen in response to lower pricing. However, Chinese demand in pricing remained challenging due to continued slow construction activity and we flexed volume into more profitable domestic markets. Overall, average realizations for our Western logs declined compared with the second quarter, primarily due to the higher proportion of domestic log sales. In the South, fee harvest volume increased and average log sales realizations improved slightly.", "Third quarter included earnings of $13 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, an increase of $8 million compared with the second quarter. Operational excellence initiatives contributed to Timberlands' third quarter results as efforts to optimize harvest settings and road and silviculture expenditures resulted in continued cost improvements. The business remained on track to meet or exceed its OpEx target for 2015.", "Wood Products, charts five and six. Wood Products contributed $85 million to third quarter earnings, an improvement of $14 million compared with the second quarter. EBITDA increased to $111 million as improved sales volumes and lower operating costs enabled the business to overcome the drag of lower average lumber realization.", "In Lumber, EBITDA declined $4 million compared with the second quarter. A 3% decrease in average sales realizations was mostly offset by seasonally higher sales volumes and improvements in logs and other costs.", "In OSB, EBITDA improved by $12 million, due to a 2% increase in average sales realizations and reduced manufacturing and log cost.", "Engineered Wood Products reported third quarter EBITDA of $36 million, compared with $38 million in the second quarter. Slightly improved sales volumes and realizations for several products were offset by higher manufacturing cost due to planned maintenance downtime. EBITDA for the distribution business increased by $7 million compared with the second quarter due to improved sales volumes and lower overhead cost.", "Our Wood Products business remains relentlessly focused on operational excellence. Lumber and OSB are on track to achieve their 2015 targets. Engineered Wood Products is tracking significantly above its EBITDA improvement target. Year-to-date, the business has generated EBITDA of $100 million, a $35 million improvement compared with a target of $15 million to $20 million.", "We made significant progress in our distribution toward our OpEx target in the third quarter as EBITDA improved to $9 million and we expect continued progress in the fourth quarter. At this point, however, we're unlikely to reach our full $20 million target for the year. With that said, I'm encouraged by our level of improvement in the third quarter and this business is highly focused on continuing to improve bottom line performance going forward.", "Cellulose Fibers, charts seven and chart eight. Cellulose Fibers contributed $79 million to third quarter earnings, compared with $27 million in the second quarter. Pulp market softened in the third quarter due to rising global inventories and the continuing challenge of a strong U.S. dollar. Average pulp realizations declined slightly compared with second quarter.", "Earnings for this segment increased significantly as maintenance expense declined and pulp production improved due to fewer scheduled maintenance outage days. The third quarter included only four days of scheduled maintenance outages, compared with a 46-day extended outage completed in the second quarter.", "The Cellulose Fibers business continues to make good progress on operational excellence initiatives as well. Third quarter results benefited from initiatives to reduce energy costs, and chemical costs, and usage. Cellulose Fibers business remained on track to achieve its 2015 operational excellence target.", "I will now turn it over to Patty, to discuss our fourth quarter outlook.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the fourth quarter is summarized on chart 12, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.", "In the West, export log volumes to Japan is expected to increase during the fourth quarter as a result of an active Japanese housing market, and we anticipate a slight improvement in prices. Although construction activity in China is still slow, inventories at Chinese ports started to decline during Q3 and are expected to decrease further this quarter. As a result, we see fourth quarter prices stabilizing.", "Average sales realizations and volumes for Western domestic logs are expected to be comparable to Q3.", "Fee timber harvest in the West is anticipated to increase slightly, as fire-related logging constraints have been lifted. In the South, fee harvest volume is expected to be in line with the third quarter and we anticipate roughly similar average sales realizations. Silviculture and logging costs will likely increase seasonally. Overall, fourth quarter earnings in our Timberlands segment are expected to be comparable to Q3.", "In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter is typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Because of the seasonal slowdown, we expect lower sales volumes. Although we have seen an increase in lumber prices thus far in the fourth quarter, average sales realizations for Q4 are expected to be lower than the average of Q3. We expect higher average sales realizations for oriented strand board in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and we anticipate that Engineered Wood Products' average sales realizations will be relatively flat.", "Production volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to decline, due to the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. This downtime will result in higher per-unit manufacturing costs.", "Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment to be lower than the third quarter and slightly lower than the earnings of Q4 of last year, which had much higher pricing.", "Our Cellulose Fibers business is continuing to experience currency headwinds due to the strong U.S. dollar. Worldwide inventories for softwood pulp stood at 30 days at the end of the third quarter. Typically, industry supply increases during the fourth quarter as there is seasonally not as much maintenance downtime in the colder winter months. As a result, we expect weaker average sales realizations for pulp in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.", "Our final planned maintenance outage for this year was completed earlier this month. The mill is back up and running well. Due to this outage, we will have more planned maintenance phase this quarter, as a result expect that overall maintenance expense will be approximately $10 million higher than Q3. In addition, we expect seasonally higher fiber costs. We anticipate that overall earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will be approximately $20 million to $25 million lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.", "Chart nine summarizes the results of unallocated items. Unallocated items moved from a positive earnings impact of $20 million in Q2 to a negative $27 million in Q3. The largest change was the result of a non-cash charge for the weakening of the Canadian dollar. As we've said in the past, every $0.01 change in the exchange rate is roughly $3 million to $4 million on a pre-tax basis. The other large variance was a lower positive effect for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO.", "Now, I'll wrap with some overall financial comments. Income taxes for the quarter resulted in a tax benefit of $16 million. This was due to a true-up of the effective tax rate for the year, which is now estimated to be lower based on the higher mix of REIT income relative to the taxable REIT subsidiary. In addition, there were discrete items booked in the quarter of approximately $9 million; the largest item being a positive resolution of uncertain tax positions.", "Now, I'll refer you to chart 10. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $282 million, or a reduction of $84 million compared to Q2. The change was primarily the result of a large working capital reduction in Q2 and normal timing of interest payments. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $112 million, bringing our total expenditures for the first three quarters of the year to just over $300 million. We still anticipate total expenditures for the year to approximate $500 million. There was no change to our scheduled debt maturities and, as you can see from the chart, the first maturity isn't until 2017.", "Chart 11 details our share repurchase activity, and we have now completed our $700 million 2014 share repurchase authorization. And as mentioned earlier, in August, the board authorized an additional share repurchase program for $500 million.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Patty. We are encouraged by the positive trend in housing and the optimistic tone we are hearing from our customers. Going forward, we remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. By relentlessly driving operational excellence in each of our businesses, we are laying a foundation that enables us to take full advantage of market opportunities. Our recently announced dividend increase and share repurchase program illustrate our confidence that we will continue to grow shareholder value by capitalizing on these activities going forward.", "And with that, we'd like to open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. Maybe a little bit of a detail question, but on the tax rate, well, maybe the easiest way to ask, what type of tax rate should we be anticipating for the fourth quarter? Kind of looks like you're 5% to 10% even after making all the adjustments for the first three quarters. Is that what we should expect for the fourth quarter?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Mark, that's our outlook for the full year and, of course, the fourth quarter will be the last one. As you mentioned, we had a number of things in the third quarter just to true up the rate for the full year, but we'll be over 5% for the fourth quarter.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay, great. And also, maybe a little bit of help, if we look at lumber pricing, which has started to move quite positively of late, one could certainly see scenarios where at least the random length average would be higher in the fourth quarter than it would be in the third quarter. Maybe a little bit more color of \u2013 your comments on why you'd expect it to be lower, recognizing maybe you sell more in October and things like that, but if you could give us a little bit of help in understanding how to think through fourth quarter lumber realization, that would be great.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. And Mark, we agree with you. There is a scenario where lumber prices could in fact be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But let me kind of give you the facts of where we are currently. If you take fourth quarter-to-date average, it's still about $15 below the third quarter average. Now if you take current prices today for lumber, it's basically in line with the third quarter average. So to your point, it's all dependent on what happens from this point going forward. We may be being conservative in terms of what we're assuming for lumber prices, but we all know that, as Patty mentioned, the fourth quarter is typically a slower seasonal period and we'll just have to see what happens in the month of November and December. So that's the way we see it at this point and we'll just watch together because our \u2013 it's nothing but a guess as to what we think's going to happen in the fourth quarter and we'll just have to see how it plays out as we move through the next couple of months.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Understood and totally fair enough. And just any color though in terms of why you think lumber has come back as nicely as it has in the last several weeks?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. I think there's a number of things that have played into that. I think what we understand in talking to our customers and buyers, I think there were very, very low inventories in the system, partially waiting to see what happens when the Softwood Lumber Agreement expired. When that did happen, there was not a lot of lumber that came on. So I think part of it has been a building back of inventories in light of that. I think there have been some slight improvements in the Chinese markets. And our take is, as long as the weather holds, as I said in my comments, we're hearing very positive commentary from our customers in terms of demand in building season. So that's I think what's happened to drive the lumber prices up over the past few weeks.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thanks so much.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.

Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "A number of producers seem to have adjusted their production schedules in 3Q given weaker Wood Products prices. I was wondering what your operating rates were in the quarter across lumber, OSB, and Engineered Wood Products? And if you took any kind of market downtime or cut shifts in 3Q or expect anything like that in 4Q?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, in terms of operating rates, lumber was right at 90%, OSB mid-90%s and ELP in the mid-70%s in terms of operating rates. And I'll let Patty, because she alluded to it in her comments, talk about the fourth quarter and some of the maintenance downtime we have planned for the fourth quarter.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. As you think about the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter is typically when we do our maintenance as well as install capital projects and most of that will happen in the Wood Products business. And it's really across the board. As you think about OSB, for example, we're installing some \u2013 not huge capital but we will take advantage of putting in things across the system. ELP will have some as well, lumber has some capital projects and also we have holiday downtime that happens in the fourth quarter.", "So if I think \u2013 as we think about our operating rates for OSB, in particular, I think as Doyle said we were in the mid-90s for the third quarter, we would expect below 90% for the fourth quarter.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just switching to the dividend, I mean, historically, you've targeted 75% of FAD over the cycle. And this year, you raised the dividend while your earnings should be down year-over-year, maybe double digits on a percentage basis. I'm just wondering if you could talk about dividend coverage and prospects for continued dividend growth and maybe the confidence that you have going into 2016 that you're going to see earnings growth next year, given we've got a strong dollar and some of these headwinds in Asia that you called out earlier as well?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Anthony, as you alluded to, our guideline, and it is a guideline is 75% of FAD over the cycle. I think the \"over the cycle\" is an important component. To your point, we feel like we are still early in the housing recovery cycle and as mentioned in my comments, we're optimistic that housing will continue to recover and will be 1% to 1.25% in 2016. As a result of that, we think we have a lot of opportunity to continue to grow earnings and cash flow going forward and are confident that we will continue to do that as housing continues to improve going forward.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. And just in terms of next year, is your view not only that you're going to see a volume recovery with starts going higher, but that will be a accompanied by price recovery as well or price improvement year-over-year in 2016?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Pricing, as we all know, is difficult to predict. But following up on the conversation we had earlier on lumber, we are encouraged that lumber prices are improving in a slower seasonal period. And our take is, as we move into the strong building season next year, again, assuming housing's at the 1.2% to 1.25% range, we think that will be very constructive for Wood Products, and frankly Timberland prices moving into 2016.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Good morning. Thanks.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I think just with the domestic West Coast prices, I think, Patty, you mentioned that the fires were a little bit beneficial for prices this quarter. Could you quantify that a little bit? I don't know, is there any risk that with the fire season going away, that prices could slip a little bit this quarter, or do you think they should be sort of pretty stable?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Tyler, we did talk about the fact that we expected to have a little more fee harvest volume in the West, but it's not a huge amount, and even in the third quarter, we didn't see as much benefit from the fire restriction as probably many expected, because of the fact that many of the mills had already, seeing the fact that the fire season was going to be so severe, had done some additional things as far as their own log supply.", "So, I don't see a huge risk related to that but the increase that I mentioned in our fee timber harvest in the West is not a huge increase. I don't think it will have that significant of an impact.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great, thanks. And then just, switching to Wood Products. Could you quantify, and I think you said the lower earnings in the fourth quarter was coming from sort of lower sale volumes, reduced operating rates and some of the maintenance in OSB. Could you kind of roughly break out how much each of one of those would contribute to the decline?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "In terms of the overall impact, I would say that there, the biggest impact of third Q compared to fourth quarter really does come from sales volumes. As we talked about, seasonally, the fourth quarter is a lower quarter for volume, and that's really a statement across most of our product lines, lumber, OSB and ELP. And certainly in distribution as well, we were very pleased with the improvement in distribution for the third quarter, but they will likely be impacted as well from the seasonal volume fall off.", "Now, having said all that, as Doyle talked about, we are pleased to see that prices in lumber especially and OSB have been coming up in the quarter. Its pricing can be very volatile, and we'll just have to see how it all plays out. But I would say across the board, the biggest negative compared to the third quarter is in sales volume. And actually, we're very pleased, when you think about quarter-over-quarter, last year in the fourth quarter, we had much better pricing than what we're anticipating for this fourth quarter, and earnings are roughly \u2013 maybe a little lower or could be even comparable depending upon where prices are. So I think you start to see the impact of our operational excellence initiative kicking into that.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And just final question with the distribution, you mentioned a nice increase in earnings. Can you just provide a little bit more detail about sort of what drove that, and sort of how sustainable it is going forward?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, what I would tell you is that it's \u2013 what we've been working on is the basic blocking and tackling of running a distribution. It's making sure we have the right warehouse and cost in places, making sure we're growing profitable sales.", "So, as Patty said, we were very encouraged by the progress we made in the third quarter, but more work to do. But we are pleased that we \u2013 on the trajectory that we saw in the third quarter and the changes that we're making in that business to position it for success in the future. So, progress, more work to do, but are confident in the plan that we have in place will get us to where we need to be in that business.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great.

Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "Well, can you just offer some broader perspective on the Softwood Lumber Agreement? I guess, we obviously haven't seen much impact in October but just how you see it playing out, I guess, over the next year while the standstill is in place?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, as we all know, the Softwood Lumber Agreement expired on October 12. Just in terms of what's happening on that, there are ongoing discussions between participants on both sides of the border regarding renewing the agreement. As well as you all know, this is ultimately a government-to-government negotiation, and election season has hampered the ability to have those discussions. But we are looking forward to both governments having an opportunity to engage and it's my take, our take that there is a possibility of reaching an agreement prior to the one year standstill playing out.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And in terms of flows, do you think recent activity is a pretty good indicator that that probably won't have a major impact in terms of flows in the market?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Yeah. I think that's exactly right. I think what's happened over the past two weeks or three weeks was in line with what we anticipated but you never know, but I do think that does show that there wasn't a significant impact in terms of flows when that agreement expired.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. And just in terms of the current market, you talked about customers having pretty low inventories and reporting the recent rally. Do you have any view has buying activity over the last couple of weeks been enough or do you think inventories are still light?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. What we think is inventories continue to be lean especially in lumber and OSB. So, yes, there has been increased buying activity, as you alluded to, and we stated, but it's our stance that inventories continue to be on the lean side.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. And you guys have a lot of \u2013 I mean, Patty alluded to some smaller stuff going on on the capital side. But you guys do have a few larger capital projects going on at at least a couple of your sawmills. I was just wondering can you give some \u2013 just kind of walk through what you're doing and actually there is $190 million going on at one project. Can you just walk through some of your bigger projects whether they're fourth quarter 2016 event?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Fourth quarter 2016, I mean...", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. I am just saying just walk through some of the bigger projects that you have going on...", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Okay.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC", "And what are the OpEx program?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Yeah. You're exactly right. We are, as we have been talking about for a period of time now, spending capital specifically in our lumber operation to support our OpEx initiatives, and to drive down our overall cost structure. So, that's happening at a number of mills, each of our mills has a specific roadmap, that's what's needed to get them to be in lowest cost quartile, and we have specific projects going on.", "One of the projects, to give you can example, is our Dierks sawmill. Our Dierks sawmill has been a very good sawmill for us for a long time. It's located in a fantastic wood basket. It's close to very good end market, but is a very old mill with an odd configuration. We are basically rebuilding that mill. We are rebuilding that mill on site. As we looked at all the different opportunities to make that mill more cost efficient that was the one that made the most sense. But to your question, Gail, every project that we're doing, the whole focus is to drive down our overall cost structures and that we will have low cost sawmill operation, and we'll be able to deliver on our OpEx initiatives.", "As we said, we're going to spend roughly total company-wide $500 million in capital, that's inclusive of what we're spending in lumber, and would anticipate the capital spend, as Patty said on the last call, will be in that range for next year as well as we continue on these projects.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Gail, the only other thing that I would add is, as you look at the fourth quarter spend, it will be our highest spend for the year, and as Doyle mentioned, the biggest piece of that will be in the lumber business in addition to the things that he talked about, there are projects that many of the mills really focused on lowering their cost structure. One piece, for example, is in our CDKs that we're putting in the continuous drive kilns at a couple of locations, both to address boiler MACT as well as bringing down drying cost, which is a significant cost. We've got some edger projects, those types of things that really will improve recovery but they really are focused on lowering the overall cost structure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Doyle, you've really made some impressive progress in all these Wood Products businesses, I wondered just if you looked at the engineered wood business that's had particularly nice gains, will there be kind of two or three key issues you'd point to that have driven that?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mark, thank you for your commentary and our employees have done a nice job of making improvements and more work to do. In terms of EWP specifically it's really boils down to three things. One is reducing manufacturing cost and specifically controllable manufacturing costs, and that's something we're focused on every day. We've also driven down our overall SG&A cost in EWP business. And then finally we're really focused on growing not only just sales, but growing profitable sales. So those are the three key levers that we've been focused on in EWP, and have been encouraged about the progress that we've made there, and we're focused on continuing to improve that operation going forward.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And over in the OSB business are there any debottlenecking opportunities there similar to sort of some of the capital that you're putting in the lumber to improve the lumber operations?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mark I would say in OSB the projects that we're doing, some of it involves debottlenecking, but more than that it's just figuring out a way to continue to improve reliability and drive down cost. As we've talked about, we've got a couple of mills that are world-class and we've got opportunities to improve some of our OSB mills to those same type of levels in terms of reliability and cost structure and that's what our capital expenditures are focused on.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Fine. Last question, I had Doyle, back in September, we had one of your peers announce kind of an interesting transaction with a group of institutional timber investors. Can you just talk about sort of the applicability or non-applicability of that kind of structure at Weyerhaeuser and maybe tie that in with how you're thinking about sort of growth in your Timberlands business over the next few years?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So, we thought that it will increase transaction that you're referring to was a very creative transaction and especially did a nice job of highlighting the underlying value of high quality Southern Timberlands. If we were at some point to conclude this type of transaction in the best interest of our shareholders, it's something we would consider. In terms of growth overall markets, we said we are interested in growing our company. Primary opportunity, we think will probably be in Timberlands, but we'll continue to be very disciplined in looking at acquisitions, opportunities as we move forward.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Good enough. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Doyle, good luck next year.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, everyone. Good morning. I appreciate the details and congratulations again on all the progress on the costs and OE. Maybe, piggybacking off the last two questions from Mark and Gail \u2013 Doyle, I think, what you'd have left in terms of projects, and OE benefit s we head into 2016 is something north of $100 million. I know you'll probably want to talk a little bit about this in December at your Analyst Day, but is there a way to at least catch us upon maybe the opportunity for more OE benefit and is there a way to talk to what you achieved in OE in the third quarter across the segments? If you had it, I'd missed it in the deck or in your comments.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, George, to your point, we will be updating exactly our progress in 2015 later this year and giving more specific guidance on the opportunities that are still in front of us, but to your point, we have made good progress. What I'm most encouraged about is, this is now becoming bottom up driven in our organization as people are really understanding what we're doing in OpEx, and finding additional opportunities. So we will be giving further update on that going forward.", "In terms of quarter-to-quarter, clearly, if you looked at price and volume and what that would result in terms of earnings, that's one number in our earnings and each of the businesses are higher than that. That delta is primarily due to OpEx.", "Looking at it, I'll just give you an example, if you look at this morning I actually looked at some numbers and I looked year-to-date 2015 versus year-to-date 2014 because I think it's hard and things move around a lot on a quarterly basis but just looking at Timberland, for example, year-to-date 2014 our earnings in 2014 were $470 million. You look at lower price, lower volume that would have \u2013 you would have thought just backing in those two things, our earnings would have been $370 million year-to-date 2015 and in fact they're $415 million.", "So that delta, not all of its OpEx, but a big portion of that is OpEx. Similar type numbers for lumber, OSB, ELP. So that's the way we think about it, just taking out the thing, the volume, the price components of it and that's how we know it's showing up in the bottom-line.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, could you remind us as you look out and do the buckets for OE change, the deeper we go into this decade or will it be pretty continuous or pretty equal contribution across the various categories for the various businesses? And that's a broad question but if you give us a bit of a feel there.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I wouldn't say changes substantially, George. We will identify broader opportunities as we move forward. As I said, the encouraging part about this is it's becoming part of our culture, it is being bottom up-driven. So things that, frankly, I would have never thought of as opportunities, our employees are bringing up as opportunities to continue to drive down our cost structure, improve our profitability. So again, we'll get more clarity on that as we move forward. But it really does boil down, as I mentioned earlier, to the basic blocking and tackling of running these businesses, but we are encouraged by the opportunities that we continue to unearth to drive our OpEx initiatives.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes. Good morning, Doyle and Patty.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Chip.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Morning, Chip.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yeah. First question, we haven't talked about Cellulose today, and I was just wondering what you're seeing in that marketplace in terms of, there's a very small player that's kind of working hard to fill up their mills because things haven't turned out the way they planned. And then you've got obviously two competitors who are involved in conversion projects next year. And could you just give me a feel for how that may or may not impact you in terms of your contracts and what you see for the marketplace?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You might imagine, Chip, we're right in the middle of that process. So let me just give you a little bit of color. I would say that we are very pleased with the demand that we're seeing for our products from our customers. We've got, as you know, very long customer relationships. So on the volume side, feeling good about \u2013 it's still just the fourth quarter, we're not into 2016 until next year and we'll give you more color as we get a little closer.", "Having said that, I do expect that there will continue to be some price pressure as we \u2013 moving forward into 2016 as you see supply and demand. But I would say, at this point, we are very pleased with where we are on that front, but more to come.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And regardless of the supply side, would you still characterize the market globally as still a low to mid, maybe even a mid single-digit growth, are you seeing that kind of growth rate? And I know it's very early days, but what do you think this change in policy in China can mean for demand, on going from one child to two children?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, more babies mean more diapers, which means more fluff pulp. So hard to factor that into the cash flow stream, but I know what the direction would be. So I think from that perspective, we feel good about that piece, but I don't know how to quite model that at this point.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then just on a separate note, I noticed the \u2013 and this would be on I guess page eight of the financial package, but the other unallocated expense, which isn't tied to FX or LIFO, was a pretty high number, $23 million. And maybe I missed it, but what was that? And I know it jumps around, but what should we expect that to do from third quarter to fourth quarter?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. We did true up some of our environmental reserves, which is probably the biggest piece of that, it's not all of that by any matter of means, we have a number of things that you saw in the second quarter. The number was I think about $13 million, went to $23 million. The biggest difference really was for a true-up of some environmental reserves that are old reserves and it's just a function of \u2013 this is kind of the time that we go through that process. There are probably some other small reserve true-ups, but that's the biggest number. Going forward into the fourth quarter, I wouldn't expect that that number would be as large as you see it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions on EWP, first of all. Have you seen any significant pressure from the decline in solid wood, because it seems like your prices were holding in pretty well?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Steve. And good morning, Steve. As you would expect, we have seen a little bit of pricing pressure as the saw log prices have come off. We anticipate, as we mentioned earlier, as saw log prices go up, some of that pressure will abate. So to answer your question, I would say, yes, we've seen a little bit of pressure, nothing significant and not something we're concerned about in the long term.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And do any of the Trus Joist facilities have the ability to participate in this cross-laminated timber market that seems to be emerging?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We are really encouraged by the cross-laminated timber emerging market. And more and more buildings, as we all know, are using wood. And yes, we are positioned to participate in that as we move forward and there are some big initiatives, as you know, to continue to encourage those efforts going forward.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Yeah, I think it's a great opportunity. And then I have one question on Cellulose. A couple of years ago, when viscose was really, really strong, you introduced your Pearl product that I believe was marketed as an extender, but I don't think you've spoken about it recently. So I was just wondering, is it growing, is it lucrative and are prices moving one way or another?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Steve, it's Patty. It is a smaller part of the overall portfolio, but we are producing the Pearl product, primarily in our Port Wentworth facility, and that does help the overall supply that comes into the fluff market. So it is still a meaningful part for Port Wentworth, still a small part as it relates to the overall pulp manufacturing and supply.", "Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "But your expertise in any future growth would be more in fluff than in the extenders, is that correct?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, the biggest impact for sure would be in fluff just based upon the size of both that market and our capacity, but I wouldn't discount the importance of the Pearl product, especially as a result, as I said, to both the price as well as additional capacity for Port Wentworth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey, everyone. This is Scott Lehmann (47:01) in for Mark Connelly. Good morning. Just two quick questions. The first one is, if you guys see these FX conditions persist for the next year, how would you expect that that would affect the mix of wood that you guys are shipping?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let's talk just a minute about what we're seeing in the export market. As we mentioned, we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in Japan. Housing continues to improve there. And as a result, we expect improved shipments into Japan in the fourth quarter and would expect that trend to continue next year.", "In terms of Chinese markets, as we referred to earlier, inventories are returning, trending back toward normalized levels. And we think, as a result, prices are stabilizing and getting inventories back toward more normalized levels by the end of this year we think positions China to be a improving market as we move into next year, 2016.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And then just the second and last question. It looks like your price realizations for Engineered Wood Products were both up in the quarter. Do you think that those markets are tight enough to allow you to pass along higher OSB prices, if OSB prices do continue to move higher over the next six months?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We'll have to see how that all figures out. As we said, for the fourth quarter, which is really on a pricing guidance what we give, think that realization will be basically flat into the third quarter.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning, Doyle and Patty.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Alex.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "A couple of ones for you. So, you and others or U.S. based pulp producers have talked about the potential impact of a strong dollar on pulp pricing, assuming the dollar does stay strong. How do you sort of handicap the potential impact to margins in pulp from that?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I think as Doyle talked about in his comments on the FX, a strong dollar is not a positive business. But I think as we look at the euro right now, if you look year-over-year, it has weakened considerably compared to the U.S. dollar. So, I wouldn't necessarily see that it will be significantly weaker from where it is today.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks a lot, Patty. And then just thinking about the manufacturing portfolio. So a few years back we were talking about engineered wood distribution is businesses that you would potentially exit unless there was material improvement in the profitability which we've absolutely seen. So is there any interest in growing those segments through M&A now that we have seen a very nice improvement in the profitability there?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you for your comment regarding the improved profitability and as I mentioned earlier, a lot of good work from our employees. With that said, in both of those businesses we still got more work to do. In terms of growth generally, we said we would like to grow our company. We'll be very disciplined about how we do that. We think our largest opportunities will be in Timberlands. But if we can find bolt-on type acquisitions and our other businesses that makes sense and drive value for shareholders, that's something we would consider. But our primary focus especially in the two businesses that you just highlighted continue to improve our existing operations.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, Doyle.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James & Associates.

Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Just first on the capital allocation front. Going back to \u2013 when you announced your $700 million buyback, I think you guys made it pretty clear that you fully intend to utilize that in context of the TRI Pointe deal. How should we be thinking about really this latest share repurchase announcement? Just given where your cash balance is now, should we view that as you're going to fully execute that or is it just kind of a tool you want at your disposal?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think when we announced the share repurchase our intent when we announced it is to fully execute it. So, we'll continue to update everybody on exactly where we are on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but our intention would be to execute the share repurchase over time.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Yeah, no, it just looked like you had \u2013 there was a little bit of a pause if you completed the full $90 million in the third quarter, and there wasn't really anything incremental for the remainder of the quarter. So that was kind of the \u2013 where the question was coming from...", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, there was nothing to be read into that Collin.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just I'm curious if you can talk a little bit more about \u2013 there have been a few lumber production curtailments announced in the U.S. South recently and obviously in response to where lumber pricing was in the third quarter. And just maybe what have you seen in terms of your Timberlands business as it relates to that? Have you had to get back at pricing at all, have you lost a little bit of volume to a couple mills, just maybe update us in context of some of the announcements in the third quarter?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. In terms of our Southern Timberlands, I would say are \u2013 whether all these \u2013 are these one off. Our demand has been continued to be fairly consistent and pricing in the third quarter was up slightly versus the second quarter. And for 2015 versus 2014, our best guess is prices will be up somewhere in the 2% to 3% range as we had indicated earlier this year. So, yeah, was there some impact from those announcements? Yes. But, it had any significant impact on our Timberlands, either volume or pricing? No.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just bigger picture, I know you've mentioned a couple of times on this call again, Doyle, just the focus on looking at growing potentially that Timberland platform, maybe more opportunities in the U.S. South. But can you just talk about given that we've now seen two of the larger deals that were out there this year either cleared or are in the process of clearing the market, just what you're even seeing in terms of opportunities right now?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There's not a lot out there right now, Collin. I would tell you, especially for higher quality Timberlands when something does come, become available, there's a lot of interest, a lot of competition and still a lot of money out there interested in investing in this asset class. But, in terms of specific opportunities other than the two that you just mentioned, not seeing a lot of activity in terms of availability.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just one last one and then just kind of piggybacking off of couple of the other questions. Just \u2013 again, congratulations on all the progress, particularly on the Engineered Wood Products business. Should we think about just given that, there still sounds like some other opportunities you want to explore there on cost savings over time. Do you think about this as now being kind of a minimum of $140 million to $150 million a year in terms of EBITDA business? I mean just maybe speak to the sustainability of the improvement that we've seen here, particularly over the last couple of quarters?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We do think the improvements that we've seen are sustainable. I do believe that we have, as I alluded to earlier, additional opportunities to improve that business going forward. So, to your point very encouraged about the progress, very encouraged about the work of our employees in that business. And there is no reason to the things that we've done aren't sustainable and that there aren't additional opportunities to improve that business going forward.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Collin.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Doyle for any closing remarks.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me just close by saying thanks everybody for joining in this morning. And more importantly, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. And everybody have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Denise M. Merle - Senior VP-Human Resources & Investor Relations", "Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2015 earnings. On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website.", "I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. For the past two years, we've been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling three key levers to drive value for shareholders: portfolio, performance and capital allocation.", "In 2015, we've made significant progress in each of these areas. We announced two transformational portfolio changes, a merger with Plum Creek that will create the world's premier timberland and forest products company and the exploration of strategic alternatives for our Cellulose Fibers business.", "We maintained a relentless focus on improving our relative performance and delivered on our second set of annual operational excellence targets. And importantly, we delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We increased our dividend by 7%, and we repurchased nearly $520 million of common shares in 2015.", "Despite ongoing headwinds related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain focused on what we could control. And for the fourth quarter, our business has once again delivered solid operating results. Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter net earnings of $59 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $121 million or $0.24 per share.", "Our primary special item for the fourth quarter was a non-cash asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate. Additional items included costs for the Plum Creek merger and the closure of several distribution centers, and a tax benefit from the expiration of our built-in gains period.", "I will begin the discussion of our fourth quarter business results with some brief comments about the housing market. The housing market maintained positive momentum in the fourth quarter as favorable weather conditions enabled building activity to continue through December in many areas of the country. Single-family housing starts improved in the quarter and ended the year up 10% compared with 2014. Total U.S. housing starts ended 2015 at just over 1.1 million, an improvement of 11% compared with last year.", "For 2016, we expect steady moderate growth in the U.S. housing market. We are planning for just over 1.2 million housing starts in an increasing single-family share. With improving job growth and historically low interest rate, U.S. economic fundamentals support a continuing recovery. Despite some headwinds from labor constraint and falling oil prices, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. Most of our customers tell us they are planning for 2016 growth rate in the low-double digits.", "Let me now turn to our business segment results, starting with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $134 million to fourth quarter earnings, an improvement of $8 million compared with the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes rose seasonally as we exited the third quarter fire season, and average log realizations increased due to a greater percentage of export sales. Each of our export markets improved during the quarter.", "Log sales volumes to Japan increased and prices rose modestly as a solid Japanese housing market continues to drive demand. So the full-year 2015, Japanese win housing starts grew by 3%.", "In China, log inventories at the ports declined throughout the fourth quarter as many suppliers curtailed shipments in response to weak third quarter pricing. Although overall Chinese market demand remained relatively flat compared with the third quarter, average realizations for our China export logs increased and sales volumes rose as we flexed volume to take advantage of opportunities created by the tighter Chinese inventory situation.", "In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Realizations for our Western domestic logs declined slightly to a greater mix of hemlock and other whitewood.", "The flooding experienced in some regions of Washington and in Oregon during December had no significant effect on our operations or infrastructure. In the South, heavy rainfall did affect harvest operations in select wood baskets, but fee harvest declined only 3% compared with third quarter as our Southern Timberlands teams did an outstanding job of flexing harvest settings in response to weather conditions.", "Although overall market conditions were stable, realizations for our Southern logs declined slightly, due to a shift in geographic mix. Silviculture and forestry expenses declined due to cost control initiatives and weather-related constraints. Fourth quarter included earnings of $19 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, an increase of $6 million compared with the third quarter.", "Wood Products, chart six and seven. Wood Products contributed $48 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items compared with $85 million in the third quarter. Special items for the fourth quarter included a pre-tax charge of $8 million for the closure of four distribution centers, as we continue to improve the cost structure of that business. Adjusted EBITDA before special items for the Wood Products segment declined to $75 million in the fourth quarter, as seasonally lower sales volumes and lower operating rates more than offset improved realizations for oriented strand board.", "In lumber, EBITDA was $22 million lower compared with the third quarter. Average realizations declined 3% and sales volumes fell 9%. Operating rates declined and unit manufacturing cost rose due to increased downtime, primarily for installation of capital projects that will continue to reduce cost within our Southern lumber system.", "In OSB, EBITDA improved by $13 million, primarily due to a 14% increase in average sales realizations. This improvement was partially offset by a 7% reduction in sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs due to planned maintenance downtime.", "Engineered Wood Products reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $14 million compared with $36 million in the third quarter. Operating rates declined due to downtime for major maintenance, capital projects, and seasonal holiday shutdowns. Sales volumes declined seasonally, and average realizations were lower due to mix. EBITDA for the distribution business declined compared with third quarter due to seasonally lower sales volumes.", "Cellulose Fibers, charts eight and nine. Cellulose Fibers contributed $64 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items compared with $79 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter results included a non-cash pre-tax charge of $84 million for the asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate.", "Pulp prices remained under pressure during the fourth quarter due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Average pulp realizations declined compared with the third quarter, and maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage dates. Fourth quarter included eight days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with four days in the third quarter. These factors were partially offset by improved sales volumes and strong operating performance.", "Pulp production rose compared with the third quarter despite the increase in scheduled maintenance outage days and several of our mills set operating records. For example, our Columbus, Mississippi mill operated at nearly 100% reliability in the quarter.", "I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook, and then I'll follow up with some specific comments on operational excellence.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the first quarter is summarized on chart 12. Now, this outlook does not incorporate the merger with Plum Creek. We'll include Plum Creek results after the transaction closes. I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.", "In the West, export demand from Japan is expected to remain strong, and we anticipate a slight improvement in pricing. The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to dampen significant price increases. Sales volumes to Japan are expected to increase more than 5% in the quarter. Our volumes and realizations for log sales to China are anticipated to increase modestly.", "We anticipate a slight increase in Western domestic sales realizations as lumber prices are expected to improve later in the quarter. Fee harvest in the West is expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter.", "In the South, sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly due to mix. Sales volumes will be lower as wet weather contributes to the typical seasonal decline in fee harvest. Earnings from non-strategic land sales are anticipated to be roughly $10 million lower than the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the fourth quarter.", "In Wood Products, lumber average sales realizations are anticipated to increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth, although prices have not improved thus far. Realizations for our other product lines as well as overall sales volumes are expected to be roughly comparable to last quarter. We expect less downtime from planned maintenance and capital projects compared to the fourth quarter. And as a result, average unit manufacturing cost should decrease. Channel inventories remain low, with customers generally purchasing for immediate needs.", "As we enter the spring building season, we do expect to see business improve. We anticipate that overall earnings on our Wood Products segment will be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth and slightly higher than the first quarter of 2015.", "In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood pulp inventories as of the end of the fourth quarter were at 29 days, down slightly from the 30 days at the end of the third quarter. This is at the high end of balanced inventory levels. We expect that average sales realizations and volumes for our pulp products will weaken during the first quarter due to continued currency headwinds and the normal effect of the Chinese New Year.", "Our liquid packaging operation will begin its planned maintenance outage this quarter, and as a result, we expect maintenance expense for this segment will increase significantly compared to the fourth quarter, which had fewer overall maintenance days. We anticipate that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and roughly comparable to the first quarter of last year. Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, and I'll refer to chart 11 for these discussions.", "Cash from operations totaled $339 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $57 million from the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $174 million, bringing our total expenditures for the full year to $483 million, well within our earlier guidance of $500 million.", "Looking ahead to 2016, we expect total expenditures for the full year to be down slightly from 2015, subject to the outcome of the strategic review for Cellulose Fibers and the transaction with Plum Creek. At the end of the quarter, we had cash of just over $1 billion and we do not have any scheduled debt maturities in 2016.", "Now, I'd like to update you on the status of our retirement benefit plans. The year-end 2015 funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post-employment retirement plans improved by approximately $400 million compared to year-end 2014. This improvement was primarily the result of the increase in discount rates.", "We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2015 and we don't anticipate any cash contributions for that plan this year. Cash paid for all other pension and other post-employment retirement plans in 2015 was approximately $80 million. We expect spending in 2016 to be approximately $60 million.", "Chart 14 in the appendix details the pension expense by business for 2015. Total expense in 2015 was approximately $42 million, and in 2016, we expect the total amount will be income of approximately $5 million.", "So with that, I'll turn the call back to Doyle.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Patty. I'd now like to switch gears and provide an update on our operational excellence efforts. Throughout the year, each of our businesses remained relentlessly focused on achieving their respective operational excellence targets. Achieving these targets is not easy. They're designed to stretch a business to deliver a step change and relative performance, and that's exactly what is happening through a lot of really good work by our employees.", "Chart 13 highlights our OpEx accomplishments for 2015 and our annual target for 2016. The Timberlands business delivered $39 million of operational excellence improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $20 million to $30 million. These results were primarily driven by cost efficiency in three key areas. First, harvest and haul cost. We're continuing the implementation of centralized dispatch systems to improve the efficiency of logging and trucking contractors and replacing costly cable logging with steep slope technologies.", "Second, spending on forest roads. We're adjusting the volume of rock relay during road construction and the level of road maintenance to match expected vehicle travel patterns and local weather conditions. Finally, silvicultural cost. Data we have collected on tree stand growth patterns enable us to custom-tailors silviculture prescriptions to apply pruning and hardwood control only to acres where those activities generate an optimal financial return.", "With total OpEx improvements of $64 million since 2013, the Timberlands business has achieved the $50 million to $70 million improvement goal we established two years ago. However, we are not done. For 2016, we are targeting an additional $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from our existing Timberlands holdings. This does not include the benefit we will get from applying our OpEx efforts to over 6 million acres of Plum Creek lands.", "The Lumber business achieved $21 million of improvements in 2015, meeting its target of $20 million to $25 million. Primary drivers include improvements in reliability and process efficiency and rigorous cost management as we continue to drive down our cost net of logs. Each mill is focused on maintaining consistent throughput and improving uptime by resolving process and equipment issues that create bottlenecks or stop production.", "Capital expenditures for the Lumber business increased in 2015 as we invested in low-risk, high-return projects to further improve the cost structure of our mills. These projects include auto graders and continuous dry kilns. We will capture the full benefits from several of these investments in 2016.", "With cumulative improvements of over $40 million since 2013, the Lumber business is nearing halfway on its journey to $100 million of controllable manufacturing cost reductions. For 2016, the business is targeting OpEx improvement of $15 million to $20 million. Oriented strand board delivered $24 million of OpEx improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $10 million to $15 million. Results were driven by improving reliability as our mills focused on eliminating sources of downtime and recovering efficiently from outage events; lowering wax and resin costs as we optimize recipes for multiple products; and increasing our mix of higher-margin products such as flooring.", "With cumulative improvements of $34 million, the OSB business is more than halfway to its $60 million goal. The business is targeting another $15 million to $20 million of OpEx improvements in 2016.", "For Engineered Wood Products and Distribution, we set specific bottom-line EBITDA improvement target for 2015 as those businesses remain focused on turnaround performance. Engineered Wood Products improved full-year EBITDA by $35 million compared with 2014, significantly exceeding its $15 million to $20 million target. Each mill maintained a rigorous focus on reducing unit manufacturing cost for all products. For example, maintenance team shared best practices across the mill system, increasing reliability and reducing cost.", "Engineered Wood Products has made a substantial improvement since 2013. Over the past two years, this business has increased annual EBITDA by almost $70 million, proving that it has the ability to perform. Our focus now is continuing to improve relative performance versus the competition. The 2016 goal for this business will not be a bottom line EBITDA target, but an OpEx improvement target of $10 million to $15 million.", "Distribution improved full-year EBITDA by $8 million in 2015. The business fell short of its $20 million to $30 million improvement target as it was unable to overcome between effect of severe winter weather early in the year and lower than expected demand in the first half of 2015. 2015 OpEx improvements were largely attributable to improved product margins and reductions in head count, warehouse and delivery expenses.", "Improvements made to the Distribution cost structure during 2015 have created a stronger foundation for better operating performance next year. In 2016, the distribution business is targeting bottom line EBITDA improvement of $15 million to $20 million.", "Cellulose Fibers. Cellulose Fibers delivered operational excellence improvements of $47 million, significantly exceeding its $30 million to $35 million target. Improvements were primarily attributable to lower energy costs, driven by our new turbine generator at our Flint River mill and a boiler conversion at Columbus and reduced usage of key chemicals as several mills-adjusted processes are tied to their digesters and bleach plants.", "During 2016, Cellulose Fibers is targeting improvements of $40 million to $50 million. With OpEx improvements of $75 million to-date, this would enable the business to exceed the $100 million goal established in 2013.", "I'll also mention the reduction in our SG&A. Part of our commitment to operational excellence is having the right cost structure across our company. Two years ago, we committed to reduce SG&A about $75 million and achieve that run rate by the end of 2014. Last year, we told you we had delivered on that commitment, and you can see our performance in this year's results. Compared with 2013, we have reduced our SG&A by over $100 million.", "Success in achieving our OpEx target was a critical component of Weyerhaeuser's 2015 financial performance, enabling us to offset pricing headwinds in many of our markets. In Timberlands, weaker year-over-year pricing for Western logs created a headwind of over $100 million. By exceeding its operational excellence target, the Timberlands business was able to overcome nearly half of that deficit.", "Lower year-over-year realizations of 11% for lumber and 9% for OSB created a headwind of over $250 million for Wood Products earnings. However, the segment captured nearly $100 million of operational excellence improvement, significantly mitigating the effect of these lower prices and earnings for Wood Products declined less than $70 million on a year-over-year basis.", "Cellulose Fibers made the headwind of over $100 million from declining pulp prices, higher fiber cost, and the effects of the West Coast port slowdown. The business offset nearly half of this amount through its OpEx efforts.", "Looking forward to 2016, our relentless focus on operational excellence remains a key component of our commitment to improve our relative performance and drive value for shareholders.", "I will close this morning with some brief comments on our merger with Plum Creek and the strategic review of our Cellulose Fibers business. The joint proxy and registration statement associated with our announced merger with Plum Creek was declared effective by the SEC on December 28. Both ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the proposals.", "The shareholder vote will be held on February 12 and we anticipate closing the merger in the first quarter. Our joint integration team is making excellent progress as we define staffing needs, establish plan for cost synergy, and position the merged company for a smooth and successful day one. The review of Cellulose Fibers is proceeding well and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete.", "As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us. Although the first few weeks of the year have been characterized by market turbulence and global macroeconomic concerns, I am encouraged by the positive trend in U.S. housing and the optimistic tone we are hearing from our customers. Our portfolio changes and operational improvements are positioning Weyerhaeuser to drive long-term value for shareholders. We will remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation, and I look forward to sharing our continued progress with you.", "And now, I'd like to open up the phone for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "In Cellulose Fibers, your average prices were down, I think, around 10% year-over-year, which is maybe a little bit sharper than the list price decline. Can you remind us, was there any mix issues there or kind of what was driving the price decline? It seemed a little bit sharper than what we might have expected? And then, just related to Cellulose Fibers, you're targeting an acceleration of OpEx improvements in 2016, and I'm just wondering if you could give a little color on what's driving that kind of year-over-year.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me start. I'll address your second question with OpEx and then, I'll ask Patty to address your first question. And what I would tell you on OpEx is we're gaining a lot of traction across our businesses and specifically in Cellulose Fibers. What we found there through Cathy Slater's leadership is an abundance of ideas that are percolating up from a bottoms-up approach in terms of continuing to drive down our overall cost structure. The encouraging thing about OpEx overall, Anthony, that we've seen is, it started off as a top-down effort.", "But as we defined winning, defined exactly what we mean by OpEx and people are incented to drive OpEx, we are having just more and more ideas bubble up in terms of the opportunities, and Cathy has a full slate of those outlined and proved in 2015 the ability to execute on those, and more to come in 2016. So, it's across the board, lower energy, lower chemicals, better reliability, all the safety blocking and tackling of running a Cellulose Fibers business.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Anthony. This is Patty. Your question on Cellulose Fibers, was it fourth quarter of 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015 in terms of...", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Yeah. Year-over-year.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. It really isn't anything significant as it relates to anything out of the ordinary. As you know, we do have a different mix in terms of both our product within our fluff mill, as well as our NBSK mill in Grande Prairie. But I wouldn't say there's anything out of the ordinary or strange about the pricing itself. It's just that the mix can change.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just shifting to Wood Products, can you share your operating rates across the three businesses? And I'm sorry if I missed this, but with OSB, can you just repeat kind of the trajectory of pricing that you're expecting into the first quarter?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure, Anthony. So in terms of operating rates, in the fourth quarter, Lumber was in the high-80s, OSB was in the low-90s, and ELP was in the low-70s. In terms of pricing for OSB, if you look at its current or first quarter to-date, average to-date is down about $7 versus the fourth quarter in terms of the OSB pricing.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Congratulations on the year. Doyle, if we can talk about operational excellence first. So you're two years into the program, you're more than achieving your goals. I'd have to imagine that you're getting to the proverbial fruit that's maybe hanging higher on the tree. So do you need to have a larger funnel to get to the goals in a year like 2015 relative to what would have been the case in \u2013 excuse me, 2016 relative to 2015 or 2014?", "And then the related question, ultimately, running a business is a lot easier than running numbers on a spreadsheet if you're an analyst. But what's been so difficult about getting the OE benefits to the bottom line and distribution?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Yeah, thanks for the question, George. On OpEx, I think you said it exactly right. It does get more difficult as you move forward. But as I said in response to the earlier question, what I'm really encouraged about and why we're confident we're going to \u2013 be able to continue to deliver on OpEx targets is because it has become part of who we are. It is being done much more from a bottoms-up approach, George. So whereas previously, you would think that we're identified at the top and kind of driven down and now more and more of these ideas.", "To your point, it's a larger funnel. More and more of our ideas are coming from our employee base, which they are the ones out there doing the hard work every day. When they understand what the opportunities are, recognize that they are empowered to go do something at those, and then send them (31:33) to do that, it's amazing what can happen. So, you're right, it is a different approach, but very encouraged by the progress. And most importantly, it's becoming part of our culture and that's why we're year-after-year, we believe, we're going to be able to continue to drive operational excellence as we move forward.", "In terms of distribution, George, it's been \u2013 while we have made \u2013 and I think it's important to highlight, we have made an improvements there. And if you look at it, we've made $40 million plus improvements over the last two years in bottom line distribution EBITDA, but we're still not where we need to be to your point. This year, I hate using weather, but weather did have an impact in the first half of the year, slower than the expected demand, and then the fact that we had kind of eroding commodity prices throughout the year limited the ability to leverage the margin improvements.", "As we said, we made some significant changes to the cost structure by closing four sites to reduce the footprint, the cost structure and really focus on our growth markets going forward. And I'll tell you, with those changes, we are confident that we're going to be able to continue to improve our distribution business. But still a lot of work to do there and still have work to do, frankly, to prove that we deserve to be in this business long term. With good progress and again with the structural changes we made in the fourth quarter, optimistic about that business going forward.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And my last question and I'll turn it over, two-part, unrelated, I guess that's two questions. First of all, what kind of pricing are you expecting on average for wood sequentially versus fourth quarter to hit your guidance? And then in SG&A, you've more than achieved your target. Should we assume that SG&A is now flat on a going-forward basis? Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, George. In terms of pricing, as Patty outlined, we anticipate prices will in fact be higher in Lumber in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. However, that's still in front of us. If you look at it currently, quarter-to-date, prices for Lumber are down approximately $7 versus the fourth quarter average. Encouraging, prices were up $4 or $5 this week. So, we'll see where it plays out. But normally, you start to see an inflection point in Lumber prices mid to late-February as the spring \u2013 as building season kicks in. And we would hope to see the same type of price inflection or improvement in OSB as we move through the quarter as well. And that's what's baked into \u2013 generally baked into our guidance for the first quarter.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, George. As you think about Wood Products, the primary price increase quarter-over-quarter that we have baked into our guidance is in Lumber and I would say we're looking for something low-single digits in Lumber. And OSB and Engineered Wood, combinations of those two, probably the results would \u2013 in our guidance would be roughly flat from a pricing perspective. But as Doyle has said, thus far for January, one month does not a quarter make, but we are down from the guidance that we have baked into the quarter.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And in terms of SG&A, George, we're always looking to drive down our SG&A costs and as we complete the merger with Plum Creek, as we already identified, there will be at least $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies. Most of that will be SG&A they did and then of course operational synergies on top of that. So like I said, we're never done on SG&A and the focus after the closure of the merger will quickly turn to the \u2013 to hard dollar cost synergies that we outlined when we announced that merger.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Collin.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "First question. I just wanted to follow up on George's question. Just as it relates to closing the four distribution centers, can you quantify how much of a lift and run rate as far as EBITDA within the distribution business? How much that specifically will provide a lift in 2016?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, as we said, we did close four sites. These were markets with limited growth potential and high cost. And we think, as a result of that, we've laid out our OpEx target for 2016, and we are confident with these changes, Collin, that we will meet these specific targets that we laid out for 2016 in terms of bottom line EBITDA improvement of $15 million to $20 million in that business.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. I'll just \u2013 is there any way to think about how much of a drag maybe those facilities were in 2015 or you don't really break it out that way?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We don't really break it out that way, Collin. I'll just tell you, it does significantly improve our cost structure. It gets us focused on the markets that we need to be focused on. And I think it's going to be a big benefit as we move in to 2016.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Then, moving to Timberlands, just maybe as we enter the year here, just update us on your latest thinking as it relates to the potential improvement in sawlog prices in the U.S. South this year? What are you thinking about for 2016 and then, just more broadly (37:09) continue to extend, just how you're thinking about the price recovery in the South?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. So, if you think about Southern log prices, Collin, our prices were up a couple of percent in 2015 versus 2014, and we would anticipate a similar increase in 2016 versus 2015.", "From a broader picture, if U.S. housing starts continue to improve, demand for lumber will rise. And we expect the tension and rising prices across the Southern log markets, we are confident that's going to continue to pay out.", "And frankly, the additional mills, whether it be the Canadians coming down and investing in mills and increasing the productivity of those mills or Klausner adding the three mills that they're adding, that's all positive from a demand standpoint for Southern sawlogs as well.", "So we are \u2013 we remain confident that we're going to reach that inflection point and see Southern sawlog prices begin to rise on a more aggressive basis than the 2% that we've seen over the last couple of years.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then switching gears and recognizing there are some limitations, I recognize what you can say is related to disclosure. But I do want to touch on the financial projections in the proxies internally within Weyerhaeuser. I was curious if you could provide any color on the kind of a drop in expected EBITDA and expected FAD reference between 2016 and 2017 on really Weyerhaeuser on a standalone basis. Any additional color you can provide on that?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, I don't think there's anything additional that we can say about that at this point.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. All right. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes. Hi. Good morning, Patty and Doyle. First question is on the \u2013 thanks. As you think about the analysis with the Cellulose division, I understand since most of its legacy proctor (39:22) properties bought 25 years ago, the basis is low. And I guess the way we need \u2013 would help me to think about this, obviously, if you do a spin, you would avoid some capital gain tax, I believe.", "But on the other hand, if you do the spin, there's a lot of cost, I guess, in terms of setting up a public company that you would not have to incur if you're just doing a direct sale of the assets. And I guess can you give me some feel for the trade-off of that? I mean, can you actually put a rough dollar cost of pursuing a spin versus just a sale?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Chip, this is Patty. I think as we think about Cellulose Fibers strategic review, we're looking at all of those alternatives and evaluating them. I couldn't put any dollars on them at this point. You are correct in that the tax basis for Cellulose Fibers is low. And so, we would have on a cash sale a tax, a gain, but we would have to compare that to what we would get in terms of a spin and both in terms of time as well as cost of setting up a separate company. But as we have done with all of our other strategic reviews over the course of time, we are looking at a broad range of options at this point.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And when you look at the distribution business, I know that it's really nice to see how every business has hit their targets, obviously, Doyle, the last couple of three years except for that one. And I didn't know if you were \u2013 just sort of give us an update on your thinking in terms of sort of how much more of time do they have before you might consider strategic review of that business.", "And then maybe just more broadly, is your thinking toward all the Wood Products segment, all the manufacturing, has that changed at all in light of the Plum Creek deal in terms of would this be an area that you \u2013 in other words, do you want to be a pure Timber play and maybe it's not as strategic?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Chip, let me \u2013 since it's Super Bowl weekend, let me use a football analogy on distribution.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yeah. But you guys aren't in it?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, I guess (41:45)...", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Sorry.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "... rough around the air (41:45).", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Don't remind us, Chip.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Everybody's walking around with a frown on their face. But in terms of distribution, Chip, I would tell you, as I mentioned earlier, we have made improvements in that business. I think the business has earned the right to continue to be on the field at this point, but has not earned a spot on the roster. So, like I said earlier, still more to do, encouraged by the progress. Like I said, we made some significant changes in the fourth quarter of 2015 and we're confident that that's going to help us accelerate progress in distribution going forward, so more work to do.", "In terms of Wood Products overall, Chip, as you've heard us say and me say historically, we believe that this can be a very good business and create a lot of value for shareholders over a cycle, assuming that you run it effectively and get the cost structure to where it needs to be, where you're back at the bottom and that you're fully capitalizing on the upturn in housing that we still have in front of us. We're encouraged by the progress we've made on the overall cost structure and our OpEx improvements and still more to come, and like I said, very well positioned to continue to capitalize on the improvement in housing as we move forward.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thank you. Two things. The rating agencies have said that given the terms of the deal, they'd probably downgrade Weyerhaeuser. Since you've said you want to remain acquisitive, would it make sense to scale back or slow down the buybacks to keep the agencies happy? And the second question is maybe a little more theoretical, WestRock has said publicly, it wants to get out of its land deals faster. Would that be something that might fit with your priorities? You've talked about wanting to expand, but is cleaning up those JVs something that might be attractive to you?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, let me talk about the acquisitive part and I'll turn it over to Patty to talk about the rating agency. Mark, we have said that we would like to grow the company. We said that our primary opportunities were in Timberlands and thus, the Plum Creek transaction. I'll tell you, in the near term, our focus and maybe our singular focus is going to be on fully integrating Plum Creek and making sure we fully realize the synergy and the value of that transaction. So, in the near term, that's going to be our primary focus and our plate's full on that. Longer term as we integrate that and get the full benefit, continuing to grow the company assuming we can find the right opportunities is something we would consider, but right now, our focus is on Plum Creek and the integration thereof.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And Mark, as to your question about the rating agencies, S&P did write that based upon their understanding of what the leverage would look like after we close the transaction in order to repurchase the shares, as we've talked about that, the leverage will be certainly higher than where we have historically been. And so, based upon their understanding, at this point, they would expect that they would downgrade us from BBB to BBB minus, so still investment grade. We are focused on bringing that leverage down as we go forward. We are still committed to the $2.5 billion of share repurchase, but certainly mindful that we'll need to bring the leverage down going forward and we think we'll have good opportunities to do that, both with respect to the broader portfolio of 13 million acres of timberland as well as depending upon the outcome of the strategic review of Cellulose Fibers.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Super. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "The whole Weyerhaeuser team has done an impressive job over the last couple of years. I had a few questions. One, Doyle, can you just clarify for us on the review of Cellulose, especially, does that include things like the NORPAC joint venture and the bleached board mill at Longview?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. So first, let me say thank you for those comments, Mark. And then secondly, yes, the strategic review of Cellulose Fibers includes all of the businesses in Cellulose Fibers.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And then to kind of follow on, on Mark's question about the rating agency, I mean there are some other things that you could look at divesting like the business down in Uruguay, which is still not generating a lot of cash. Any thoughts on that, Doyle?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "As we've said, as part of the integration process, we'll do a thorough analysis of all 13-plus million acres with 13-plus million acres and the fact, Mark, and I think this is an important one to highlight, with the recent tax extender package, reducing the build-in gains period permanently to five years, we no longer have that constraint. So, 13 million acres with \u2013 plus no longer being under the built-in gains tax. We have lots of flexibility in terms of what we could do going forward.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Now, last question I had is to kind of come back to something Collin Mings raised and that is you've got a lot of capital tied up in Southern timberland and you're going to commit a lot more capital here pretty quickly to Southern timberland. But if we look at the cash returns on Southern Timber, they've been pretty anemic for about a decade now. What gives you the confidence that these returns are going to improve significantly over the next few years, and what do you think that trajectory looks like?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Mark, what gives me confidence and gives us confidence is basically supply and demand. And as you know, ultimately that works. And if you just look at it from a housing continuing to improve and housing has improved, it's been slow but steady. So, I think that's going to be what's going to happen on the demand front.", "And on the supply front, if housing continues to improve, the supply is not going to come from the Pacific Northwest, the supply is not going to come from Canada. Yeah, we see a little influx now because of exchange rates in China, but ultimately, they, being Canada are limited because of the pine beetle situation as to what they're going to be able to provide. So, supply and demand works. We're going to reach that inflection point. And when we do, that's when we're going to see a significant change in Southern sawlog prices.", "So, yeah, it comes slower than any of us would have expected or hoped, but if you just look at the basic supply and demand, we remain confident that we will in fact see improved prices for Southern sawlog just like we have historically.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "And, Doyle, just to follow on this, we all, I think, buy into supply and demand. But on the supply side, it seems like for many years here because of the weakness in housing, we've really been under-harvesting the growth rates down in the South. So we've got some accumulated inventory, and I just wonder how that accumulated inventory affects the rebound in pricing.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Mark, that's a really good point and there's no doubt that there is some accumulated inventory as housing has improved over the last couple of years, we have started to work through some of that accumulated inventory, but there's still some out there. So that's why I'll say there's still a little bit of time, if housing continues, to improve to work through accumulated inventory. But once we do that, you can hit that inflection point of supply and demand, and that's where you start to see the significant increase in pricing.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. I'll turn it over. Good luck in 2016, Doyle.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. First, a numbers-oriented question. Just on the Cellulose Fibers business, can you provide us with at least preliminary estimates on the maintenance expense and scheduled maintenance outage days for the \u2013 for 2016 by quarter if possible? Is that something you have handy?", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, we can't give it to you by quarter, Mark. I can tell you that as you think about fourth quarter to first quarter and the guidance that there's about roughly $10 million of additional maintenance expense in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-on to that, the $40 million to $50 million of OpEx improvement in Cellulose Fibers, does much or any of that come from being able to effectively reduce maintenance outage expenses? So will we see it in not variable year-to-year?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That is not a key driver of the OpEx improvement that we laid out, Mark. There is, of course, some benefit as we go into the 18-month schedule, but that's not the big driver of what we saw in 2015 versus 2014 nor we'll see in 2016 versus 2015.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And then, maybe lastly, kind of following on Mark Wilde's question a little bit. One of the components of the bullish lumber, as well as log story has been the expected reduction in supply coming from British Columbia related to the beetle, et cetera. It doesn't seem to have happened yet and lots of reasons maybe that (51:48). Are you still of that view that we will see a reduction and any color you can provide on how that might play into the market?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, Mark. We are absolutely confident that that's going to happen and all you have to do is spend some time in that area and see the devastation that the pine beetle has, in fact, caused. You're starting to see some announcement as you know of some lumber mill closures because of that. I think what's happened is, part of that has just been distorted by the fact that there's been less demand from China. So, some of the impact from lumber that would normally would get on to China has come to the U.S. and that has temporarily offset the pine beetle situation. But if you just look at what the allowable cuts are, if you look at just the overall fiber situation in Canada, we are confident that the pine beetle scenario is going to play out.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "Yes. Thanks very much. Just looking at your overall volumes in both Timber, well I guess, Timber, Lumber and OSB. What are you planning for 2016? I noticed 2015 Timber volumes were down but you had gains in Lumber and OSB. Just wondering at a higher level what the plan is.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, we would say unit for 2016 in terms of sawlogs overall, we would then anticipate volumes from being flat to maybe down just very slightly. In terms of Lumber and OSB, part of that of course will be dependent on markets. But as we continue to improve our reliability, we would think Lumber and OSB volumes will be up slightly in 2016 versus 2015.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And just a follow-up, just a flat to down on the log side, is that related to not so robust markets or is that because you're logging at a sustainable level?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think it's more related to the fact that we're logging at sustainable levels. As we said, we have the ability in any given year to flex 5% or maybe a little more depending on markets. So we'll see how that plays out and that will ultimately determine what the harvest levels are. But basically, we are harvesting at sustainable levels.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "Great. That's where I'll put the vote.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Doyle for any final remarks.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you and thank you for everybody's interest today. Before I \u2013 or in closing today, I want to say some words about Patty as this will be her last earnings call on behalf of Weyerhaeuser as she will retire later this year. Specifically, I want to acknowledge her outstanding work as the CFO since 2007 and personally thank her for partnering with me over the last couple of years as we've taken significant steps to make Weyerhaeuser a truly great company. Thank you, Patty, for all you've done for Weyerhaeuser.", "Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, Doyle, let me, just before you close the call, interject one additional thank you to the analyst community on the call. We are very fortunate as a company to have a whole host of very knowledgeable people, and I've enjoyed the dialogue over the years.", "And as I do retire from Weyerhaeuser now, I feel very confident in the management team going forward, really pleased with the progress that we've made on portfolio performance and capital allocation, and couldn't be more pleased with my successor, once we close this transaction, Russell Hagan. I think that as we go forward, since I will continue to be a significant shareholder, I think that we have a lot of additional capabilities and levers to pull to create ongoing value for shareholders.", "So, Doyle, thanks to you and thanks to the whole senior management team and employees of Weyerhaeuser.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Patty, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to our host, Beth Baum. Ma'am, Please go ahead.", "Elizabeth L. Baum - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Ginger. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2016 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website.", "On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion.", "Second quarter results include after tax earnings of $38 million from discontinued operations and $11 million of after tax charges for merger and legal expenses. Results for our entire Cellulose Fibers segment are reported as discontinued operations. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we're into $130 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA from our continuing operations was $413 million and this represents an improvement of $77 million or 23% compared with first quarter results.", "I'm proud of our second quarter operating performance. Our teams continued to execute well and deliver solid operating results including Wood Products strongest second quarter in over a decade. In the quarter, we also announced the sale of our pulp mills and liquid packaging board facility for collective proceeds of $2.5 billion or approximately $1.8 billion after tax.", "Closed the Twin Creeks transaction receiving $440 million in cash and in transaction value and 260,000 acres of Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. We purchased over $830 million worth of our common shares, and made strong progress on merger integration and activities as we work together to successfully integrate Plum Creek and fully capture the cost and operational synergies that will drive superior value for our shareholders. Before I turn to our second quarter business results, let me make some brief comments about the housing market.", "Single family housing starts continued to grow at double-digit rate, and year-to-date activity remains in line with our expectations. Through June, single family starts had improved 15% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis, and total US starts were up 8%. Although supply side constraints such as skilled labor, permitting delays and fees and rising land and construction costs dampened the market's acceleration during the second quarter, solid economic fundamentals including job growth and historically low mortgage rate continued to drive improving housing demand. We continue to anticipate approximately $1.2 million housing starts for 2016 in line with consensus estimates.", "Let me now turn to our business segment. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $125 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $21 million to $220 million. Non-cash depletion and amortization costs increased by $25 million following a full quarter of higher depletion rates, resulting from acquisition accounting.", "Western Timberlands contributed $114 million to second quarter EBITDA compared with $118 million in the first quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased but average realizations for Western logs declined modestly primarily due to a greater proportion of sales to domestic and Chinese markets.", "As anticipated, sales volumes to Japan declined in the second quarter as first quarter post forward (05:01) demand in advance of a scheduled consumption tax increase which was later delayed. Pricing for our Japanese logs moderated slightly in the quarter. Volumes to China rose due to seasonally higher construction activity and average log realizations were essentially flat.", "Log inventory to Chinese ports were a little changed during the quarter and remain at normalized levels. In western domestic market, log supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Average realizations declined slightly due to mix and per unit logging cost increased seasonally as second quarter harvest includes a greater proportion of higher elevation white wood.", "Southern Timberlands contributed $99 million to the second quarter EBITDA, $22 million more than the first quarter. Southern (05:51) increased by 40% due to a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly due to mix, as second-quarter sales included a higher percentage of pulp wood. Silviculture and forestry costs increased due to catch-up on first-quarter activity and has been delayed due to wet weather. Northern Timberlands' EBITDA improved slightly compared to the first quarter.", "The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million operational excellence targets for 2016. During the quarter, internal benchmarking teams completed an initial survey of operational synergy opportunities and prioritized areas with the greatest potential value. A deep-dive comparison of each company's practices in the highest-value areas is under way. We are pleased with the progress to-date and look forward to capturing these opportunities later this year and into 2017.", "Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $12 million to second quarter earnings compared with $15 million in the first quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $28 million. For Real Estate, the number of acreage sold declined slightly due to the timings of transaction closings. Average price per acre increased as second quarter included the sale of a high value parcel in Cannon Beach, Oregon.", "EBITDA from Energy and Natural Resources operations improved slightly. Our Real Estate team is running full out as they apply a concrete to asset value optimization or AVO process to the legacy Wayerhaeuser Timberlands. This work is proceeding well, and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in early 2017.", "We expect real estate activity will ramp up significantly in the fourth quarter of this year, and into 2017 as this process moves toward conclusion.", "Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $156 million to second quarter earnings, an improvement of 80% compared with first quarter. By effectively capitalizing on improving market and ongoing operational excellence initiatives, the business delivered its strongest second quarter since 2005. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $189 million, $72 million more than the first quarter.", "EBITDA from lumber grows to $96 million. This is an improvement of $45 million or nearly 90% compared with first quarter. Average realizations improved nearly 10% and sales volume increased by 8%. The business also had another strong quarter operationally. Western log costs declined and recovery improved and manufacturing costs net of logs decreased due to the continued benefit of operational excellence initiatives.", "OSB contributed $43 million to EBITDA, $12 million more than the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased 12% and our mills continued to run well.", "Engineered Wood Products EBITDA increased to $45 million, $14 million more than the first quarter. Sales volume rose due to seasonally higher demand and a full quarter of Plum Creek, MDF and plywood operations. Average realizations for solid section and (09:27) declined slightly due to mix.", "In Distribution, EBITDA rose $5 million compared with first quarter due to improved sales volume, higher margins and ongoing cost control. The business have increased EBITDA about $14 million year-to-date against the 2016 full year target of $15 million to $20 million.", "Late in the third quarter, we announced changes to improve the profitability of our Montana wood product operations. In the third quarter, we will permanently close the lumber and plywood mills in Colombia Falls. These moves will allow us to align the available logs supply with our manufacturing capacity including adding shift at our Kalispell facilities and best position our Montana operations for long-term success.", "Wood products remains relentlessly focused on OpEx initiatives and is on track to achieve its 2016 target. During our first quarter earnings call, we indicated we thought the second quarter Wood Products results could be comparable to second quarter of 2013. A time when we were just beginning our OpEx journey and lumber and OSB pricing were significantly higher than it is today.", "In fact, we've exceeded second quarter 2013 EBITDA by $23 million despite the fact that average lumber realizations in the second quarter were $35 per 1000 (10:46), lower than three years ago and average realizations for OSB were more than $90 per 1000 (10:53), lower than they were in the second quarter 2013. This overall improvement highlights the significant contribution, operational excellence is making to our business results.", "I will now turn to discontinued operations, chart 11. As I previously mentioned, beginning this quarter our entire Cellulose Fibers segment has been reported as discontinued operations This includes results from our pulp mills, liquid packaging board facility, and a printing papers joint venture. Discontinued operations contributed $52 million to pre-tax earnings compared with $29 million in the first quarter.", "Average sales realization for pulp and liquid packaging rose compared with the first quarter. And sales volumes for liquid packaging increased. Maintenance and energy cost declined slightly. Second quarter results also reflect accounting changes resulting from the reclassification as discontinued operations. Non-cash depreciation expense decreased by $23 million compared with first quarter due to a requirement to seek depreciation on asset held for sale, and corporate overhead expense previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers is now reported in unallocated items. This change affects both current and prior periods. These expenses total approximately $9 million per quarter or approximately $35 million on an annual basis.", "The effect of these accounting changes was largely offset by charges associated with the strategic review process and other transaction expenses. Yesterday, we received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance in the US for the announced sale of our pulp mills to International Paper. We continue to make progress, remaining regulatory approvals, primarily competition clearance in several foreign jurisdictions. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter. Similarly, we have received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the sale of our liquid packaging business and continue to progress with remaining approvals. We expect to close the liquid packaging transaction in the third quarter.", "The process for our premium paper joint venture is proceeding well. We are actively working with prospective buyers and we will update you when that review is complete.", "I want to thank our Cellulose Fibers' employees who are maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering strong results throughout the strategic review and sale processes.", "I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items, and our third quarter outlook.", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide \u2013 chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly or roughly 5% compared to the second quarter due to seasonality and lower export prices.", "In our Western Timberlands operations, overall, we expect harvest volumes to be similar to second quarter levels. Although Japanese housing activity remained strong, we anticipate crisis will soften as markets adjust to the delayed increase in the consumption tax.", "In China, seasonally slower construction activity and continued currency headwinds will result in lower sales volumes and moderately lower pricing.", "Domestic log volumes and prices are expected to remain stable. Operating conditions throughout the Western region have been favorable as the risk of fire has been low. Western logging costs will be seasonally higher in the third quarter as summer weather allows us to shift harvest activities to higher elevations, which have a higher percentage of cable logging and longer haul distances. In the South, fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than the second quarter but on a lower grade mix as third quarter activity typically includes a higher percentage of a thinning volume.", "Silviculture and road spending will also be seasonally higher. In the North, third quarter harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the prior quarter. Note that second quarter harvests are the lowest of the year because of logging and hauling limitations due to spring breakup, or as we like to say in the Northern Woods, the mud season. We expect average sales realizations will be similar to second quarter levels.", "In Real Estate, and Energy and Natural Resources segment, we expect significantly higher earnings and adjusted EBITDA from real estate sales during the second half of the year. Nearly all this improvement will occur in the fourth quarter. Third quarter real estate activity will be primarily focused on continuing work on the AVO process, in building our inventory of higher and better used properties. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly compared to the second quarter, but the mix of real estate sale is slightly heavier to higher basis lands.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA will be more than double the third-quarter level as the first results of AVO assessments in the portions of the US South are taken to market and begin to move through to closing.", "The Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain tight as buyers continue to only purchase product to meet their immediate needs, which has been pushing lumber and OSB pricing higher as we enter the third quarter. We're anticipating comparable sales volumes and continued strength in lumber and OSB pricing in the third quarter as housing starts, especially single family, continue to improve and builders move into the late summer building season. We expect to see continued solid performance in Engineered Wood Products.", "Overall, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be considerably higher than the second quarter. Lumber and OSB prices improved throughout July. If prices stabilize at current levels for the balance of the quarter, the segment is on track to improve EBITDA and earnings by roughly 10% compared with second quarter. However, we believe there's continued upside for both lumber and OSB prices and anticipate earnings could exceed this level.", "Now, let me direct your attention to chart 10 which details the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $1 million, $9 million lower than the first quarter results, which included a $13 million gain on foreign exchange. Note that unallocated corporate function expenses now include approximately $9 million of costs that were recorded in Cellulose Fiber segment prior to the discontinued operations reclassification.", "Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $485 million, up $74 million from the first quarter. Cash flow from operations including Cellulose Fibers was $492 million for the second quarter. This is an increase of $445 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year.", "In addition to increased cash flows from Wood Products and Timberlands segments, we saw positive variance in our working capital due to the seasonal decrease in inventory levels quarter-over-quarter. Cash from investing activities was a positive $350 million for the quarter, as we received $440 million in cash proceeds from the Twin Creeks transaction, which closed on April 1.", "Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $101 million, including $12 million of our discontinued operations. We expect 2016 CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $425 million, with Timberlands' capital spending expected to total $125 million for the year, and Wood Products' spending of approximately $300 million.", "Financing cash flows included $831 million for share repurchases, and $228 million for common dividends. As of June 30, we had drawn $1.4 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.4 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. We intend to pay down the term loans for the proceeds from our recently announced asset sales.", "Interest expense of $114 million for the second quarter reflects a full quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. We expect interest expense will be comparable in the third quarter. For our continuing operations, the company anticipates the full-year tax rate will be between 18% and 20% based on the expected mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income.", "I'll wrap up with chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchases activities. Through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 58 million shares of common stock under our February 2016 share repurchase program at an average price of $29.18 per share.", "We have continued our repurchase activity during the third quarter and as of August 1, our cumulative repurchases totaled $1.98 billion or nearly 67 million shares at an average price of $29.45. The company did not repurchase shares during the period June 1 through June 28 because of the measurement period for our mandatory convertible preference shares.", "The mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares on July 1 at a rate of approximately 1.69 common shares per preference share. As a result, common shares outstanding increased by approximately $23.2 million shares subsequent to quarter-end.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Russell. I will wrap up this morning with some brief comments on integration, synergy and SG&A. We continue to make strong progress on merger integration. I'm encouraged about the teamwork I see among employees at all levels as we work together to service our customers, identify best practices and implement improved processes for our merged company.", "We have fully identified the sources of the $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies. As of the end of the second quarter, we are capturing about one-third of these reductions on a run rate basis.", "I'm highly confident we will reach our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year one. In addition to capturing merger synergies, we must address the $35 million of corporate costs, formerly allocated to the Cellulose Fiber segment. To ensure our businesses remain competitive, we will eliminate these costs just as we did following the divestiture of our Home Building business.", "We have been planning for the reductions as part of the strategic review process, and anticipate eliminating these costs within 12 months after closing the International Paper transaction.", "In closing, I will mention that the move to our new Seattle headquarters remains on track for mid-September. I'm also pleased to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, December 13. We will send out the details in a press release later this morning.", "At that meeting, we will provide specific updates on progress against the key targets for our merged company, and you will have an opportunity to hear firsthand from each of our business leaders about their key initiatives as we work together to drive superior value for our shareholders.", "And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning. Timberlands \u2013 as you think about 3Q in the South, I think you talked about softer price mix. If you take the impact of mix shifts away and you just look at same product prices. I was wondering what you're seeing in July and August. Are prices just flat or you're seeing any kind of improvement in Southern log prices?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Now, Anthony, what we're seeing is if you take it \u2013 and you're thinking about it exactly right on what I'd like to say, an apples-to-apples basis, prices we anticipate will be essentially flat in the third quarter versus the second quarter.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And I guess, what do you attribute that to? I mean, presumably lumber mills can pay more for fiber and housing starts are growing double digits. Is there just too much inventory out there? Why aren't log prices improving or inflecting as I think some of us thought that they might now by now?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Anthony, and the question, and we've all talked about it is as what is the inflection point where you see significant improvement in pricing. And we remain confident, as housing continues to improve as you said, as additional lumber capacity comes online in the South we remain confident we're going to hit that inflection point based on where supply and demand reach equilibrium. And at that point, well, we believe we'll start to see Southern log prices begin to return to the levels they were prior to the recession. However, we don't think we're going to see that in the third quarter. We're set to wait as we move forward to hit that inflection point.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Okay. And then, just in Wood Products, you mentioned the Columbia Falls announcement and adding shifts elsewhere. Was Columbia Falls \u2013 will it end up being kind of net neutral from a capacity standpoint? And then just generally, if you could talk about your Wood Products footprint. Are you adding capacity with the increase in starts or how should we think about for the year?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So for the year, Anthony, overall, we're running our facilities close to 95%, 96% 97% operating rate due to these good markets. So, you always have a percent or two of Creek (25:46), but we don't anticipate adding any significant capacity in the near term.", "Columbia Falls net-net, you will have lower capacity but higher profitability. As we stated when we announced that, the reason for that move was to align the available fiber with the productive capacity, and by doing this, we are able to run the remaining mills full out with additional shifts, which will ensure the long-term success of our Montana operations and improve the overall profitability of our Montana operations on a go-forward basis.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Our next question is from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. How you doing? Doyle, first question in Wood, obviously, very strong result, better than your guidance. As we look out the next couple of quarters, where do you see the most cost pressure? And you're doing a great job on SG&A relative to the revenue base in the business. That's obviously part of the program at Weyerhaeuser, but where do you start to see some tension here? How long can you hold the line here within Wood? And then I had a couple of follow-on questions on SG&A.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "In terms of cost pressures, George, at this point in time, we don't see any significant cost pressures now. It all runs up, you clearly would have some freight cost pressures and people continue to anticipate that happening at some point, but in the near term, don't see any significant cost pressure. We'd love to see some cost pressure from a log perspective, but not seeing that as we just referenced in the near term.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Yeah. That was part of the question behind the question. The second question I wanted to get into is on Engineered Wood. It sounds like from your commentary that you're pleased with the performance there. And looking at the slide deck, if I thought correctly, we've seen price is drifting a bit lower. If that's correct, what's driving that? Is it again lack of cost push? Is it perhaps somewhat more competitive markets? Single-family starts are obviously doing well, which you would think would be beneficial for Engineered Wood supply, demand and market trend. So, how would you frame that for us?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, what I would say from a pricing perspective, a big part of that slight downward pressure we've seen is just having to do with mix. As we move forward, George, I would say that there are some price increases. Or a price increase that will be playing out in the West, but a portion of that price increase will be offset by some pricing pressure in the East as you have the dealer consolidation and all the different things that are happening from a customer perspective overall. But going forward, we would anticipate prices would be flat to maybe up slightly.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then the last one if, again, we did our math right. Again, you've done a very good job on SG&A over the last number of years across the businesses. If I look at Timberland, if I look at Real Estate & ENR versus year-ago levels that ratio has ticked up a bit. Obviously, some of that's probably just mixed in Plum Creek. Again, can you help frame what the opportunity there is for cost reductions in the next couple of quarters as you come out of 2016 and head into 2017? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, George. And the way we look at these cost reductions is pretty straightforward. We say, what was the SG&A and R&D for both combined companies in 2015, and as we said, our goal, and we're confident in reaching that goal, it's about the first quarter of 2017, we will be at that run rate. So, we're modeled \u2013 we're as you would anticipate, George, we're on top of that. We know exactly where we are. We've identified the source of those synergies, and we're starting to realize some of it, more to come as we run through the balance of this year and into early next year. But that's the way we're monitoring it to make sure it does, to your point, in fact, show up on the bottom-line.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, Doyle. Thank you. Good luck in the quarter.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Collin Mings from Raymond James.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Collin. How you doing?", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Good. Good. A few questions here. First, just maybe big picture, talk a little bit more or update us on how you think the softwood lumber negotiations are going to play out, and just kind of your update as far as thoughts if no deal is reached in the standstill period, comes and goes without a deal.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. And as you know, we are very actively involved with and aligned with the position of the US Coalition, and there is an ongoing dialogue between the Coalition and our US Trade representative. I do believe participants send from both sides are interested in a resolution. And I'm frankly encouraged the governments \u2013 each of the governments are continuing to have discussions.", "As you know, this is a really important issue for Weyerhaeuser, and we remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached prior to the deadline. But we're prepared to move forward if that doesn't happen in follow trade days (31:21). That's kind of where we are.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for the update there. I think, one thing as far as in the prepared remarks, roughly you talked about CapEx, the $425 million. I think that's down from a comparable $450 million, I think, that's what you had got it to earlier. Is that right? And, maybe, what caused the change there?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, it's correct. We did lower our CapEx spend. We brought it down a little bit on the Timberlands side as we look at the combined operations for the Plum Creek and Weyerhaeuser. We've just refined that number as we move into the second half of the year.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just thinking about some of the commentary around the expected ramp in real estate sales, maybe just talk a little bit more about order of magnitude, what you're think in the fourth quarter could be as far as the amount of step-up. Again, I know, we talked on prior calls about the overall ramp showing up more in 2017, but just from a modeling standpoint, how should we think about the fourth quarter?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So, Collin, as we look at the third quarter, we'd expect the third quarter to be pretty similar to the second quarter. And then again, as we bring more of the AVO (32:27) properties into the market and we started ramping up that program, you would expect the fourth quarter to really increase probably double the third quarter volume.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. That was very helpful. And then just one last one and I'll turn it over. Just going back to Anthony's question on Wood Products. How much of your EBITDA is generated from Canada operations at Wood Products?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Collin, I don't know that number exactly off the top of my head, we'll follow up. But most of our revenue is generated out in the US, although Canada is an important part of our overall Wood Products operation. So, I'll have to get back \u2013 we'll get back with you on that.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russ.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Russ, is it possible to get a go forward look at annual harvest volumes in the South and in the West?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "As we have guided to our total year volumes, we're at about 40 million tons to 42 million tons. So, as you look at our harvest volume to-date, and then you can extrapolate out to what you think the third and fourth quarter will look like, but we don't provide specific guidance for the volumes on a quarter-to-quarter basis.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And is there likely to be a difference between what you'll do, say over the next three to five years in terms of harvest volumes, and then what you might define as kind of long-term sustainable? It seems to me both Longview and some of those (34:13) properties offered opportunities for accelerated harvest in the near years.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Mark, what I would tell you is, as you would anticipate, we're spending a lot of time updating our strategic harvest plans for the combined land base. So, we're right in the midst of that, so we'll give you some \u2013 in the future, we'll give you some look at how we think that'll play out in the time horizon that you just laid out. We're right in the middle of that process currently.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. All right. And then, Doyle, can you just give us something of what you're expecting from Japan over the next couple of quarters?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So, Japan has been interesting in terms of how this consumption taxes has played out in the second quarter. As we talked about, the volume s down due to the latest consumption tax and prices decline. In the third quarter, Mark, our best guess is that volumes will be kind of flattish. And prices could be down slightly again as consumption tax plays out and also from the competition from the European laminators due to the strong dollar.", "And then as we look in our crystal ball and the crystal ball isn't always right, but as we look in our crystal ball for the fourth quarter, we would expect some rebound in prices in both Japan and China. That's kind of how we see it playing out.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. All right. And then, final question, just when we think about the SLA, Doyle, is it \u2013 would we be correct if we think the sort of the biggest issue for you guys in how this plays out is really the impact and sort of value of timber coming off of your Southern and your Western Timberlands?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There's no doubt, Mark, that that is an important component of getting the SLA right on a go-forward basis.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "But if we get tougher restraints, could we see you actually increasing the amount of capital you'd put in the saw mills?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Mark, as you know, we have an ongoing \u2013 a game plan to \u2013 that we've shared with you and others about the capital that we'll be spending in our Wood Products operation on a go-forward basis to make sure we're positioned well, to fully capitalize on the upturn and get our costs to where they need to be. So, spending capital in our Wood Products operation at about the $300 million level that we've done over a past year or two, we think is going to be the right level, at least in the near term going forward.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Thanks, Doyle. Good luck.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "Yes. Thank you, and good morning, Doyle, Russell and Beth.", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Chip.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "So first question \u2013 a couple of just accounting things. One is, I know that when you sold the Cellulose business, and congrats on getting that approval, they at least said that the EBITDA in 2015 was $350 million. And I'm just wondering, would that have really been $386 million or does that $350 million not include that corporate cost number for them?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Chip, I'm not \u2013 that $350 million is really based on their calculations and based on their models. And so, while we did see that number, you definitely want to look \u2013 we're reporting up to the point of where it's going to be out of our system. I really can't comment on how they came up with that particular number.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "So, that's what, it was for 2015? But I guess another way to ask the question is if I look at last year's EBITDA, as you reported it for the segment, then obviously about $36 million of the EBITDA would've been $36 million higher without these corporate cost allocations, is that fair?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes. That is correct.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "Okay. And then the second question is, I know \u2013 I believe it's just typically the case, but when you make it a discontinued operations, I believe the number you present in your slide includes all the cash costs, but not depreciation. In other words, you said that it made $52 million, but that, I would assume, does not include depreciation or does that bear any depreciation, or for that matter, any interest expense?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes. So we \u2013 there's $23 million of depreciation associated with that that was \u2013 we stopped, mid-quarter. If you looked at prior quarters, it would be about \u2013 the equivalent would be about $38 million of depreciation.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "Okay. So, you actually had $38 million per quarter going into the second quarter, but then you did $23 million in the second, and it'll be zero in the third. Is that fair?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Correct.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a more broader question, thanks for those details, is when you look at Eastern Canada, I've been hearing that \u2013 and I don't think you guys are terribly active there, but as you think about the lumber market, it seems like Eastern Canada, I'm hearing that their harvest or their growth of timber has actually come back in recent years and that there would be more activity there in lumber and perhaps even plywood, but lumber in particular. If there is any market for off take, OSB plants or pulp mills. And do you agree with that? In other words, do you think that you could see potential supply, leaving aside any kind of trade issues, coming from Eastern Canada or do you think that's not likely?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Chip, I would say, at least from our standpoint, it's in the not likely category. We have not seen what you're referencing and don't think additional capacity or additional capabilities are going to be available in Eastern Canada.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "And would you say it is fair in the Eastern half of the country, I'm not so sure about the West part of the continent that your residuals can often by a very material percentage of your profit?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's a \u2013 it's an important part. That's right.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "Understood. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thank you. Doyle, is it safe to say that with the better lumber prices and very successful asset sales that you're feeling pretty good that Weyerhaeuser has addressed the rating agencies issues and that at this point, you've got room to execute on your buybacks the way you want to rather than to make them happy.", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. Mark, this is Russell. We definitely spend time at the rating agencies to make sure that they understand our deposition and our EBITDA generation. And we're very comfortable with where we're at with the rating agencies and our current investment grade rating.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And Mark, as you referenced the share repurchase \u2013 we have, as we said, we were going to do it on an accelerated basis. We've essentially completed the $2 billion in, I guess, less than six months and did it in what we think has been a attractive value from our shareholder perspective of less than $29.50 per share. So, pleased with the progress that we've made on the share repurchase.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "That's super. And just one quick comment or question on the log realizations. We've heard that smaller land owners in the South had been more aggressive. Do you think that's one of the reasons why we haven't seen log prices keeping up? Or is that not as widespread as we're hearing?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think that is a component of what has happened on the log pricing. Small land owners, you never exactly what motivates them or when they bring things to market. But clearly there, we have seen some of that happening over the past year or two.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC", "Hi. Good morning. A quick question...", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Gail.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC", "A quick follow-up on the buybacks. If I remember correctly, it was initially going to be $2 billion of the $2.5 billion was going to be accelerated, and I'm just wondering if you could give some perspective on your approach to that remaining $500 million?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC", "Will that be also accelerated or more opportunistic?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. So, you're exactly right, Gail. What we've said is that the authorization for the $2.5 billion, if we will do $2 billion on an accelerated basis, and as I just mentioned, we have essentially completed that. We've also said consistently that once we do, we'll take a pause and we'll work closely with our board to determine the timing of the additional $500 million. So, that's what we'll be doing.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC", "Okay. This might be a little off the wall, but (43:14) used to talk about trying to build an export market out of the South? And is that something, an effort that you're continuing, and what your view would be from that, on the long-term?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. We are, as you would anticipate constantly evaluating our markets and the way to grow markets. As you also know, the South is very small in terms of export market currently, but we'll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward, and we think that market will in fact develop over time.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC", "Okay. And just one last one, yesterday, your partner with some of the development plans, and around the Carolinas is talking about an accelerated monetization. And I was just wondering if you could give some perspective on how that might affect Weyerhaeuser?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So those are the joint venture partnerships that Plum Creek entered into. And we have been in discussions with them, and we're aware that they're seeking to do an accelerated program to divest to some of those properties. Given that's a joint venture, we treat that as equity accounting. We'll see the benefit of that as they execute on that plan.", "Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the real estate, and the stepping up of activity there later this year and into next year, is that primarily going to be on legacy Weyerhaeuser lands or would we \u2013 should we expect it to be a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek? Because obviously the Plum Creek land presumably were stepped up, but the Weyerhaeuser lands haven't been.", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, Mark, this is Russell. We'll see a mix, but we may see some more Plum Creek lands coming in, in the third and fourth quarter, which will result in a little higher bases because of that step-up. As we look at the combined portfolio, obviously, we're focused on getting to the Weyerhaeuser lands through the AVO process. But in conjunction with that, we're looking at all the opportunities on the combined portfolio. And it really does provide us with a lot of optionality as far as which lands to bring to market.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And then, shifting gears a little bit, but any kind of big picture thoughts on how you'll be going about the dividend recognizing you had a lot of improvement in your Wood Products business. It's kind of underlying earnings there. Yet, Timber has maybe been a little bit slow to see the price improvement in the South. How \u2013 what might be a kind of a helpful way of thinking through how you'd be approaching the dividend at this point and if it's changed at all as your mix of businesses have changed quite a bit in the last year or so?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Mark. As you know, we're committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. 2016 is going to be very noisy as we continue to move forward and lots of moving pieces. As we look into 2017, we're going to continue to benefit from cost and operational synergies, continued OpEx improvements, strong housing market, all those types of things.", "We will be spending time with our board as we move forward to figure out exactly how to think about the dividend on a go-forward basis with the mix of assets that we now have with the much more stable earnings stream that comes from Timberlands and then the improvements that we've made in our Wood Products to take some of the volatility out of that, and most importantly probably to eliminate some of the downside in our Wood Products operation on a go-forward basis. So, all things that would be factoring in to what the appropriate level of our dividend is on a go-forward basis.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And one last one if I could, the tax rate guidance, 18% to 20% I guess a little higher than I would have anticipated. And maybe, what one question would be, does the interest expense \u2013 can that get allocated to taxable \u2013 the taxable REIT subsidiary or does some of that actually run through the \u2013 not get that benefit?", "Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. So, Mark, we're guiding the 18% to 20% for our full year tax rate. As far as the allocation of the interest expense between the taxable REIT subsidiary and the REIT, we actually have debt that is associated with taxable REIT subsidiary. So, that's allocated and tax effected accordingly. And then, there's debt associated with the REIT assets. So, you'll get a blended rate.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. I'll circle back. Thank you.", "Operator", "That is all the time we have for questions today. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?", "Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Thanks everybody for joining. As indicated, that was our final question, and I'd just like to close by thanking everybody for their interest in Weyerhaeuser. Take care.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "Ms. Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.", "Elizabeth Baum", "Thank you, Ginger. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2016 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.", "Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website.", "On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $227 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Our third quarter results include after tax earnings of $65 million from discontinued operations and $10 million of after tax charges for merger related expenses. Excluding these items, we earned $172 million or $0.23 per diluted share. This is an improvement of over 30% compared with second quarter and over 40% compared with a year ago.", "Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $434 million, an improvement of $21 million compared with the second quarter. Our employees delivered strong performance in the quarter, as operating results improved across each of our businesses with Timberlands driving increased EBITDA through merger synergies and Wood Products achieving its highest third quarter earnings in 12 years.", "However, these results reflect only some of our quarterly achievements as we also closed the sale of our liquid packaging board business, completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Seattle and completed our commitment to a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase. I'm proud of what our teams accomplished and the pace at which they continue to operate as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company.", "Before turning to our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Third quarter housing activity was roughly in line with our expectations and we are anticipating nearly 1.2 million housing starts for 2016 in line with consensus estimate. Although total housing starts for September were weaker than expected, the headline number was driven by the volatile multi-family sector. Single-family starts have continued to grow at a favorable pace. Through September, single-family starts are up approximately 10% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis and low inventories of homes for sale reflect continued steady demand.", "As we enter the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, we're encouraged by the strength of some timber permitting activity, new home sales and continued solid builder confidence. Although constraints such as skilled labor permit delays and fees and rising costs for land and construction maybe functioning as a governor on supply side growth, rising employment and wages and favorable mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand.", "Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts three to five. Timberlands contributed $122 million to third quarter earnings and $223 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased about a $3 million compared with the second quarter. Western Timberlands contributed $109 million to third quarter EBITDA compared with a $114 million in the second quarter. Western fee harvest volumes decreased and average log realizations were largely flat.", "Sales volumes to Japan improved moderately during the quarter, as low mortgage rates continued to drive strong housing activity and the effect of the delay in the consumption tax increase continue to fade. Average realizations for Japanese logs declined slightly early in the quarter, but stabilized as the quarter progressed. Sales volumes to China decreased due to timing of shipments and a slight seasonal decline in demand and average realizations decreased modestly. Log inventory to Chinese ports declined during the quarter and remain within a normalized range.", "Western domestic markets remained solid during the quarter and pricing for domestic logs improved marginally, as some markets were tensioned by fire related harvest restrictions and increased mill demand. Western logging costs benefited from operational excellence initiatives during the quarter. Although we anticipated a seasonal increase in per unit logging cost due to the harvest on higher elevation stands, crews were able to mitigate this cost increase through new harvesting technology that improves productivity on steep slopes and reduces the need for the highest cost cable logging operations.", "Southern Timberlands contribute a $108 million to third quarter EBITDA, $9 million more than the second quarter. Seasonally higher log sales volumes were partially offset by seasonally higher silviculture and forestry costs and a 1% decrease in average log price realizations. This decline was partially attributable to mix as third quarter harvest included a slightly higher proportion of pulp wood. Southern logging cost benefited from operational synergies with merger integration progress enabling further optimization of logging and hauling activities across the combined ownership.", "Northern Timberlands' EBITDA improved $3 million compared with the second quarter. Seasonally higher volumes were partially offset by weaker realizations and seasonally higher road and forestry expense.", "Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced a strategic review of our Uruguay operations. This review will enable us to ensure that we're best positioning the business for long-term success and maximizing value for our shareholders. We look forward to providing further information after the review is complete.", "The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and synergies, and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million target for 2016. Internal benchmarking teams are rolling out their initial best practices that resulted from comparing a subset of high-value activities at each company. We are pleased with the progress to-date and look forward to continuing to capture the benefits later this year and into 2017.", "Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, chart six and seven. Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to third quarter earnings, compared with $12 million in the second quarter. EBITDA increased by $9 million to $37 million. Real Estate EBITDA increased by $7 million. Average price per acre declined slightly as we sold a greater percentage of lower value Northern acres compared with the second quarter. Contribution to earnings increased minimally due to a proportionally higher land basis as the northern properties are legacy Plum Creek holdings that were marked up to fair value in acquisition accounting.", "Our Real Estate team is making strong progress as they applied Plum Creek's asset value optimization process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. Work began first in the U.S. South and that process is entering the latter stages. As we wrap up portions of the Southern analysis, the focus will turn to the West. Work remains on track and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in the first half of 2017.", "Wood Products charts eight and nine. Wood Products contributed $170 million to third quarter earnings, an increase of $14 million compared with the second quarter. These earnings are the strongest since third quarter 2004 when we operated roughly twice the number of manufacturing facilities we do today. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $203 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled to $85 million. Average realizations increased less than 1% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes decreased slightly due to downtime for capital projects and weather. Log cost for Canadian mills increased primarily due to weather and Western log cost were also higher.", "EBIDTA for OSB increased to $63 million, an improvement of over 45% compared with the second quarter. Average sales realizations increased 7%. Operating performance was very strong and the business benefited from operational excellence initiatives to reduce spending on controllable manufacturing cost, wax and resin. Engineered Wood Products contributed $43 million to EBITDA compared with $45 million in the second quarter.", "Sales volumes for Solid Section and I-Joists increased modestly and average realizations were flat as improved pricing in the West was offset by slightly lower Eastern realizations and a weaker product mix. EBITDA for distribution declined slightly to $7 million, primarily due to a seasonal shift in products mix. The business remains focused on improving margins and lowering costs.", "Year-to-date, Wood Products earnings have nearly doubled compared with 2015 and operational excellence has made a meaningful contribution to that improvement. The Wood Products segment has made good progress on this year's OpEx initiatives, and remains generally on track to achieve this 2016 target.", "I will now turn to discontinued operations, chart 11. Discontinued operations, which was formally our Cellulose Fibers segment, contributed $65 million to after-tax earnings in the third quarter. This includes an after-tax gain of $41 million on the sale of our liquid packaging board business, which closed on August 31 for gross proceeds of $285 million. Excluding this gain, net earnings from operations declined $14 million compared with the second quarter. Maintenance expense increased significantly and pulp production declined due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. This was partially offset by higher average sales realizations for pulp, primarily due to mix.", "On October 4, we announced an agreement to sell our printing papers business to One Rock Capital Partners. This completes the strategic review of our Cellulose Fibers business announced in November, 2015. Both this transaction and the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper are on track to close in the fourth quarter. I'm proud of the contribution our Cellulose Fibers employees have made to Weyerhaeuser, and I want to thank them for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering a superior customer experience throughout the strategic review process.", "I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.", "Russell Hagen", "Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in chart 14 of the earnings slides.", "In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly over the third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate harvest volumes will be lower than third quarter levels. However, we expect sales realizations will increase modestly in each of our export markets as housing activity remains strong in Japan and Chinese demand remains solid.", "Domestic log sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase slightly in the fourth quarter, as a result of steady domestic demand and seasonally lower available log supply.", "Western logging costs will continue to benefit from the results of our operational excellence initiatives. Southern harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than third quarter. Minerals have adequate log inventories entering the fourth quarter and average sales realizations are expected to be flat quarter-over-quarter. Silviculture and road spending will be seasonally lower in the South during the fourth quarter. In the North, fourth quarter harvest volumes will decrease seasonally from third quarter levels, as third quarter is typically the best operating quarter of the year.", "Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, while adjusted EBITDA will be about double from third quarter results.", "It is important to note that the real estate sales include a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser properties and Plum Creek properties. And that the Plum Creek properties have proportionally higher basis, because they were marked to fair value in the purchase price allocation. This results in lower earnings when these properties are sold.", "For Wood Products, we expect lower demand due to seasonal decline in building activity. Channel inventories remain lean as buyers purchase for immediate needs. We expect lumber sales realizations in the fourth quarter will be flat to slightly down compared to third quarter levels. We expect OSB prices will decrease, giving back much of the third quarter gains.", "Engineered Wood Products prices are expected to be similar to the third quarter. We anticipate seasonally lower sales volumes across all product lines in the fourth quarter, and a slight increase in manufacturing costs, as a result of the holiday season, and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and the earnings for the Wood Products segment to be seasonally lower than the third quarter. We do however, expect adjusted EBITDA will be nearly double the fourth quarter of 2015.", "Moving on, chart 10 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $5 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter. As a reminder, unallocated corporate function expense now includes about $9 million of expenses, previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers.", "On October 31, our partner in the Southern diversified timberland venture redeemed our interest. Following the redemption, Weyerhaeuser now holds all of the equity interest and consolidates the timberland venture as a wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result in consolidation, the investment was eliminated and the note payable to the timberland venture has been classified as intercompany debt. At the end of the second quarter, the investment in the timberland venture was $825 million and the note payable was $830 million. These items no longer appear on our balance sheet as of September 30, for financial reporting purposes.", "Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 million, an increase of $284 million from the second quarter. This is higher than our targeted cash level and we expect the balance will decrease as we pay down the term loans with proceeds from previously announced Cellulose Fiber asset sales. We expect these sales will close by year-end.", "Cash from investing activities during the quarter, included $285 million from the sale of the liquid packaging board business. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $129 million, including $29 million for our discontinued operations. CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter, $150 million will be for Wood Products which typically has a highest capital spend during the fourth quarter.", "Financing cash flows for the quarter included $231 million for common dividends and $11 million of preferred dividends, which represent the last dividend payment on the mandatory convertible preference shares. During the quarter, we drew an additional $300 million on our term loan. And as of September 30, we had drawn $1.7 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.7 billion was $6.6 billion at the end of the third quarter.", "Interest expense was $114 million in the third quarter. We expect interest expense will be similar in the fourth quarter. For our continuing operations, the company now anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the expected mix of 2016 earnings between the REIT and the taxable REIT subsidiary.", "I'll wrap up with chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $306 million completing our post-merger goal of repurchasing $2 billion of our shares on an accelerated basis. Overall, under the $2 billion accelerated program, we purchased a total of 68 million shares of common stock at an average price of $29.49 per share.", "On July 1, the mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares, as a result of the conversion, the company issued approximately 23 million shares. We ended the quarter with about 748 million shares outstanding.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Russell. I'll wrap up with some brief comments on merger synergies and integration. We continue to implement the changes necessary to achieve our $100 million hard dollar cost synergy target. As of the end of the third quarter, we have achieved about two-thirds of these reductions on a run rate basis. I'm highly confident, we will meet or exceed our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year one.", "We've also fully identified the sources of reductions for the $35 million of costs formally allocated to Cellulose Fibers and are on track to eliminate these costs within one year of closing the International Paper transaction.", "The integration with Plum Creek continues to progress well. Working together will be the foundation of our success and I'm encouraged by the team work I see within and between the businesses and functions of our merged company. I'm excited by what we've achieved and where we're going, and I look forward to continuing to share our successes with you as we work together to drive value for shareholders, through a focused portfolio, industry leading performance and disciplined capital allocation.", "And now with that, I'd like to open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Hi. Good morning.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Doyle, I had a question on the Softwood Lumber Agreement, earlier this year there seemed to be some optimism \u2013 a new agreement would be negotiated. And over the past couple of weeks we've had U.S. legislators and the Canadians issuing statements, saying the other side isn't serious. I was wondering if you were surprised by the lack of an agreement at this point and kind of where we stand here, and with the exploration of the standstill period, I guess the U.S. Lumber Coalition has talked about initiating trade cases and to the extent that you're able, I was wondering if you could give us any thoughts on that process.", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, Anthony as we previously said, we're very actively involved with and fully supported of the U.S. Coalition, and frankly, we would prefer the certainty of a negotiated agreement and hopeful that one will be reached. And as you mentioned, the governments are having ongoing negotiations and those are pretty fluid right now.", "With that said, as we've said consistently, any agreement would need to be consistent with the objective identified in the Obama-Trudeau joint statement, which is to maintain Canadian exports at or below an agreed U.S. market share to be negotiated. So, where we are now, I think is ongoing negotiations, but if no agreement is reached, we would expect a petition will be filed soon and then, we'll see how it plays out from that point forward. So, that's kind of where we are in the approach we're taking.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, just switching gears to Wood Products. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment in engineered Wood Products? I think there were some price initiatives on the table earlier this year, and in 3Q, prices seem to be flattish to maybe down a little bit. I was wondering if you could just talk about the forces that are impacting that market and kind of outlook for 4Q?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. So, there are a lot of moving pieces in the pricing for EWP currently. To get to your second part of your question, we anticipate EWP prices will be essentially flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Regarding the price increase, the price increase that went into place within the West in the second quarter and third quarter that was successful, but was offset by some pricing pressure in the East. As you know, Anthony, there's been a lot of dealer consolidation in the Eastern markets and a lot of jacking around has occurred in those markets. So, up in the West, down in the East, which has resulted in the net pricing that we saw in the third quarter, we think that's stabilized and anticipate essentially flat prices in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Maguire", "Just wanted to follow-up on the Wood Products, obviously a really strong quarter, like you highlighted in the prepared remarks [indiscernible] year-on-year. But it seemed like it could have been maybe even a little bit better if lumber margins had been closer to where they were in 2Q. And I know you mentioned maybe some downtime and weather-related issues. But just wondering if you could dig into that a little bit more and talk about the margins in lumber and where they might be headed from here?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, so I think, there were three things that impacted our lumber results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And as you mentioned we had a strong second quarter in lumber, but three things in the third quarter. One was we had slightly lower sales volume. Two, as you mentioned, lower operating rates that was due to weather and some downtime for installation of some capital projects as we continue to invest capital in that business to drive down our overall cost structure. And then third and the most surprising one for us that log cost increased in Canada, that was weather-related, and as you may know Canada has been very wet this year and as a result having to spend additional dollars to get wood to the mills, so that had an impact.", "And then also we had higher log cost in the West, that's consistent with what we reported in our Timberlands operation. So those both higher log costs in Canada and the West impacted our margins and results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Going forward, we would anticipate as we said, lumber prices in the fourth quarter to be essentially flat to maybe down just a little bit in fourth quarter versus third quarter.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. Great. And then just a follow up one on the Real Estate segment in the fourth quarter. I know you said, you'll be about double in the EBITDA. Is that the start of maybe a trend higher here as you're getting through the process of evaluating everything, can we start to think about it being somewhere closer to that neighborhood and where you've been historically or is there just some lumpiness in it and then we're kind of back to lower levels in 2017?", "Russell Hagen", "Brian, this is Russell. On the Real Estate as we mentioned, we expect fourth quarter to be double the third quarter, and then we would expect that trend to continue as we work into 2017, and work through our AVO process, and really start bringing some of the Weyerhaeuser properties in through the Real Estate program. So as we've indicated, our target for the Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resource business is at 15% of total EBITDA, and so I would expect that in 2017, we will start moving towards that target.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill.", "George Staphos", "Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for the details. I want to...", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, George.", "George Staphos", "How are you doing, Doyle? I wanted to dig into Wood Products a bit further. Can you comment at all \u2013 maybe provide a few more details in terms of where you stand with being \u2013 as you've termed to black at the bottom, I know we'll get more color probably in December on this, but what other initiatives do have going on or where you stand in terms of the \u2013 are you \u2013 you're certainly not a 100% done, but where you stand in terms of being done on that project?", "And the related question was on operational excellence you said, as you were talking about Wood, if I heard you correctly that you're generally on track, now that's fine. But I kind of took your comments, as maybe there were some areas that weren't progressing quite as well as you'd like, if that was a correct assessment, where do you need to see some accelerated pick up? And then I had a couple of follow-ons either way.", "Doyle Simons", "Okay. So, George, to your point, we will be talking about both of those issues extensively in our December investor presentation, which we're looking forward to. But let me give you a sense on both of those.", "In terms of black at the bottom, as you know and we've talked about consistently over the past two years to three years, that has been our focus, in terms of our operational excellence initiatives, driving down our cost, the capital that we're spending, and we've made a lot of progress on that front. As you said, we're not there yet. But I would say, we're 60% to 70% of where we need to be, maybe even a little more than that in terms of getting our cost structure where we're black at the bottom. And as we've said before, what we measure that against is what happened back during the recession in the 2007, 2008, 2009 type timeframe. So, a lot of progress made there, more work to do.", "In terms of generally on track, George, I wouldn't over focused on the, generally. I would say, we are on track, in terms of our OpEx initiatives, still I guess, three months left in the year. So, didn't want get up over our sleeves, but again, we will give you a report on that in December but \u2013 and very pleased at the progress we're making in our Wood Products operation and frankly also in our Timberland operation, in terms of delivering against our OpEx targets for 2016.", "George Staphos", "All right. Thanks for that, Doyle. Two last ones and I'll turn it over. As we think about value return and the dividend, certainly the company has done a very, very good job of returning value to shareholders over the last couple of years, so this is not a complaint.", "As we think forward for the dividend, should we more or less think about it trending with the realizations that you can get in Timberland, in terms of what drives the next level of \u2013 if there's anything left for that matter of a sustainable pickup in the dividend growth rate? And then, just Russell, on the term loan, should we expect that you will be paying that down pretty quickly from here on a going forward basis? Thanks, guys, and good luck on the quarter.", "Doyle Simons", "Thanks for those questions, George, and I'll address the dividend increase and then, I'll ask Russell to answer the term loan question. So, in terms of the dividend, again as we've said it consistently, we are committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. 2006 is a very noisy year, as we all know as we do these various transactions, but looking into 2017 as we think about it, we're going to benefit from our cost \u2013 continue to benefit from our cost and operational synergies, continued OpEx improvements and what we believe will be stronger housing markets.", "To your point, we're also going to benefit from a portfolio perspective, from a much more stable earnings streams for Timberland. And as we just talked about improvements made in Wood Products cost structure to eliminate some of the downside. So with all that said, we'll be working very closely with our board to determine the right level of dividend going forward. And Russell, if you'll address the term loan question.", "Russell Hagen", "George, as I mentioned, we have $1.7 billion drawn on the term loan as we start closing on the Cellulose Fibers transactions, we'll start paying that down, so we would expect that to be paid down hopefully by year-end or soon around that time.", "George Staphos", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes. Good morning, Doyle and Russell.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Chip.", "Russell Hagen", "Good morning.", "Chip Dillon", "First question is, I might be mistaken, but I think you're earning maybe more than 100% of the cumulative profits in the engineered wood business, that's quite a turnaround. And I really seriously wanted to ask you about, with these kind of some numbers and looking at the rest of the industry and it looks like you're not necessarily transferring raw materials in low, so how are you doing it? Is it because of the distinctiveness of some of your products or would say that maybe it is being vertically integrated or maybe there is something else that we're missing?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. I would not attribute it a much of it Chip to being vertically integrated. I would attribute it to all the things that we've been working on now for two years or three years starting to fall to the bottom line in terms of log recovery, controllable spend, preventive maintenance. Chip you've heard us talk ad nauseam about, it's the basic blocking and tackling. And I think, we're starting to see the benefit of that hitting the bottom line. And the other part of it, as you mentioned is kind of the products that we bring to market and the additional value that we give for some of those products. So I think it's a combination of both, but I think really the reason for the improvement that we've seen over the last two years or three years have primarily been driven by just basic blocking and tackling in that business.", "Chip Dillon", "And I suppose, it's safe to say, it's no longer sort of in the category that you put it in when you had first Investor Meeting with us?", "Doyle Simons", "Chip, I'm happy to say that it is no longer in that category. I think that business has proven the right, to be part of our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Now you constantly got to earn that right, but that business as you highlighted, and I appreciate you saying it, has made a dramatic turnaround in terms of bottom line performance.", "Chip Dillon", "And then just a couple of quick ones and turning it over \u2013 before turning it over is, could you update on what you \u2013 and you might have mentioned this, what you see CapEx at this year? And I know it's early, but directionally where should it go next year? And then lastly for Russell, I know there is roughly a $600 million tax bill tied to the sale of the Cellulose business, does that tax actually get paid in cash sometime in 2017?", "Russell Hagen", "So the first question on CapEx, as we've indicated, we're focused on about $425 million CapEx this year, a $125 million in Timberlands and $300 million in Wood Products. I think next year we expect around that general amount maybe just a little more in Timberlands as we bring in the combined Plum Creek and Weyerhaeuser properties. As far as the tax bill on CF, we would expect that to be paid hopefully again by year-end, but possibly in the first quarter.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research.", "Gail Glazerman", "Hi. Good morning.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Gail.", "Gail Glazerman", "I assume this is baked into your guidance. But can you talk about any impact you had from Hurricane Matthew either in terms of your operating facilities or your timber operations?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. So, yeah, we're fortunate, Gail, from the hurricane perspective that we had minimal damage to our Timberlands operations due to the hurricane a couple of days or maybe a little few more that we were kind of out of the woods in the Atlantic region, but very minimal damage. In terms of \u2013 from a Wood Products perspective, we had some production loss as you would expect at our Atlantic mills, we had some minor water damage to some finished lumber, but nothing that's [Technical Difficulty] (34:32) financially.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay. And going back to Softwood Lumber Agreement, can you just give a little bit of color on how it's affecting your conversations with customers, and how they may be preparing forward as they look out to the building season next year?", "Doyle Simons", "I mean clearly, there's some uncertainty regarding the Softwood Lumber Agreement and how it plays out, Gail. But I wouldn't say it's affecting the way our customers are thinking about their ongoing business. And, in fact, customers continue to be \u2013 especially homebuilders continue to be very optimistic about the demand that's out there in terms of new home sales and just underlying demand for new houses. So, it's a minor part of our conversation, it's not a major part, but our customers continue to be optimistic for the balance of 2016 and into 2017.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay. And just one last one. Can you give any sort of color on the export markets, particularly maybe some of the competitive dynamics in terms of logs from Russia, and New Zealand, or even some finished Wood Products from Europe going into Japan, just what you're seeing, and how that's been trending?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. So, let's talk about that, and bottom line is we're encouraged by what we see in the export market currently. From a Weyerhaeuser perspective, we anticipate that \u2013 from \u2013 in Japan, which as you know is our most important market, that pricing will be up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, due to steady demand and lower log supply that always happens in the fourth quarter. We think volume maybe down a little bit, but that's just going to be due to timing and the way the shipping worked.", "In China, we continue to see a solid demand, anticipate higher prices in China in the fourth quarter, and encouragingly inventories actually came down a little bit in third quarter versus the second quarter. They are currently at 3.38 million cubic meters, which is down from where they ended at the second quarter. In terms of just overall views on it, we've seen a slight increase in imports into China from Russia, but nothing significant, and New Zealand seems to have kind of stabilized. So, that's what we're seeing overall in export markets.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay. And in terms of European competition in Japan with finished goods?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. So, that's the challenge that our customers face is Glulam that comes in from Europe, currencies have not been helpful from that perspective. But the good news in Japan is housing is growing 6%, 7%, 8%, and our customers continue to have very good demand for our Doug Fir which is used of course to build houses. And these solid logs or solid lumber is a preferred building material post and beam construction.", "Gail Glazerman", "Thank you.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Wilde", "Doyle, first question. It sounded from your comments like maybe the AVO process was going a little bit slower than expected. You said you expected to have it substantially done by the end of the first half of next year, I think initially we've been talking about it sort of by late this year, very early next year?", "Doyle Simons", "No, Mark, I wouldn't say it's slipped. Our focus has been on the South. And as I said, we are in the process of wrapping that up. Currently, we're in the latter stages of it. We'll then be moving to the West, and it may take us into the second quarter to complete it in the West. But I would actually tell you it's going very well. Our biggest opportunities as we said all along are in the South, so we're pleased that we're wrapping that up. And as Russell mentioned, I think we're going to start to really see the benefit of that in early 2017, as we move forward with this process. So, I would categorize it is right on track.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. All right. That's helpful. And Doyle, can you give us a little bit more color, background on the Uruguay announcement? And then, if you were to dispose that, what you would likely do with the capital?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. So Mark, as we previously mentioned, as part of this merger integration, we've been in a review of all 13-plus million acres of our timberland. As you know, Uruguay is a project that was started back from the ground-up back in the mid-1990s and is just now really coming into maturity. Our focus going forward is going to be primarily domestic and we think there may be an opportunity to position Uruguay with what I would call a more natural sponsor that maybe more focused on those markets going forward.", "In terms of what we'll do with the cash, as you would anticipate Mark, we'll run that through our capital allocation priorities as we do everything and figure out the best use of that cash to drive value for our shareholders long-term.", "Mark Wilde", "All Right. And Doyle just if I could, the one other kind of block of land that seems like a little bit of an outlier is these kind of Northern Timberlands in New England, and the Great Lakes, they're not plantations. It's a little different business than what you have in the South or the West, any thoughts there?", "Doyle Simons", "Mark, I would answer that this way and consistent with what we've said before. We're in the midst of a review of our overall timberland portfolio with 13-plus million acres that we now have, we have lots of flexibility as to how to create the most value for our shareholders, so we'll be factoring all that in, as we move forward.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. Last question I had Doyle is just, back on the SLA one more time. I am just curious, from your perspective it seems to me that we're likely to have a more protectionist administration, no matter who is elected come January. And I am just curious about whether you share that view? And whether you think that's having any effect on sort of the negotiations right now? In other words, are the Canadians perhaps more interested in getting something done with this administration rather than waiting to see what they get come January?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. Mark, I would say, I don't think the election is currently having much effect on the negotiations. And in terms of predicting what in the hell may happen in this election or what the implications of that maybe is probably not somewhere that I should go or I'm qualified to go. So, we'll see how the election plays out, but we are encouraged, Mark, at this point about the negotiations that are going on between the government and we'll just have to wait and see how this plays forward?", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. All right. Sounds good. Good luck in the fourth quarter and into next year guys.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.", "Mark Connelly", "Thank you. Doyle, two things. Obviously the step up in basis affects the real estate profit that you report. But it doesn't mean that the sales are any less attractive. Can you give us a sense of whether these were higher or lower than average quality sales?", "Russell Hagen", "Mark, this is Russell. I think on the call, as we mentioned a lot of those transactions were in the Northern properties, it's not that they weren't lower quality, it's just lower price per acre than you would see in the West or in the South.", "Mark Connelly", "Okay.", "Doyle Simons", "But Mark, you're exactly right on your first comment that \u2013 yeah that doesn't mean they're not quality sales just because they were written up. So thank you for making that point, that's exactly right.", "Mark Connelly", "Yeah. Russell, what I was really trying to get at is relative to what you do in the North, was this pretty typical stuff?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, I think those are typical transactions that you'd see in the North.", "Mark Connelly", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just one simple question. How much of higher OSP prices that we saw in the quarter actually hit engineered Wood Products in the quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense of how fast that flows through.", "Doyle Simons", "About $2 million impact in the quarter Mark.", "Mark Connelly", "Perfect. That's all I need. Thank you very much.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Collin Mings from Raymond James.", "Collin Mings", "Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Collin.", "Collin Mings", "I guess, just first one, just recognizing you're taking a pause right now, [indiscernible] Cellulose Fibers sale is being finalized. Just maybe update us on how you're thinking about the remaining $500 million under the share purchase reauthorization, again, especially here with the stock at 30 box or so, not too terribly different than kind of the average repurchase prices of $2 billion that you completed this year?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah, Collin as you'll recall when we announced the merger with Plum Creek, we said at that point in time that we were going to do $2 billion of the $2.5 billion on an accelerated basis. And as you just alluded to, we completed that actually in a little less than six months. We also said at that point in time, when we announced it, that subsequent to that, we would take a pause and work closely with our board to determine the timing of the additional $500 million, see where we were on our Cellulose Fibers transaction and a lot of other factors. So we're in that pause period, we will work closely with our board to determine what the timing is going to be on the additional amount. And as you alluded to, where our stock is trading, will be an important component of that decision.", "Collin Mings", "Okay. And then just following up on the commentary as far as the outlook for Q4. Just on Timberlands, you indicated that it would be up modestly relatively to 3Q, but could it actually be higher year-over-year relative to 4Q 2015, or is it likely to fall somewhere in between?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. I'd have to go back and look at the 4Q 2015 numbers because as you very well know, Collin there is lots of moving parts with 4Q of 2015. We didn't have Plum Creek as part of the company. So, we'll have to get back with you on exactly that. But what I would say, as we said in the guidance, we do think it will be up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and a big driver of that, as I mentioned earlier is what we're seeing in export markets.", "Collin Mings", "Okay. And then, just one last one from me. Just as you're budgeting for 2017 and given kind of the lack of momentum clearly in log pricing in the U.S. South this year. I mean just curious how you're thinking about shaping up harvest activity for next year again recognizing, you're not providing guidance on harvest volumes at this point. But just how does that factor in Doyle? This is as you've referred to before just a stubbornly low log pricing in the U.S. South as you think about harvest plans?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. Well, we are working on our harvest plans right now, Collin. As we put the two companies together, we think we're going to have the opportunity to maximize the harvest plan on a go-forward basis. As part of that, we will factor in what we think is going to happen with Southern sawlog prices. We do remain convinced that we are going to reach the inflection point where Southern sawlog prices are no longer stubbornly low, but start to head in the right direction. We're encouraged by what we see, as I mentioned earlier about continued growth in housing, and are also encouraged by some of the announcements we've seen regarding additional capacity coming online in 2017 in the South. So all of that will be factored in and we'll be providing more color on that as we move forward.", "Collin Mings", "All right. Thanks, Doyle. See you in December.", "Doyle Simons", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Steve Chercover from Davidson.", "Steven Chercover", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could recap the dissolution of the timber joint venture, if I'm not mistaken, the counterparty was The Campbell Group, and I think, you said the debt in the note will negate one another. But is there any kind of capital call? And then I had a second question.", "Russell Hagen", "Sure. So this is Russell. As I mentioned, we did dissolve that at the end of August. And when we did that, if you recall that was 450,000 acres in six states, it was a joint venture with The Campbell Group. They redeemed their interest and so we received the note back, distributed to Timberlands. There is a small gain in recognition at about $6 million, but there is no additional capital calls and there is no continuing ongoing obligation.", "Steven Chercover", "Okay. Well, that's good news. And then I thought \u2013 and hopefully this is just a red herring that the IRS was challenging the structure and there was some discussion or litigation with them?", "Russell Hagen", "So you're correct. So our 2008 \u2013 Plum Creek's 2008 income tax return is currently being audited. And as you recall Plum Creek, we appealed that to the IRS but we could not reach a resolution. And so recently Weyerhaeuser filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court and as you are aware this will take a number of years to resolve, but we remain confident that in our position, we do expect a favorable outcome from the U.S. Tax Court.", "Steven Chercover", "And I assume that Weyerhaeuser didn't put out a filing because it's not material, but can you tell us in a worst case scenario what the financial impact might be?", "Russell Hagen", "Yeah. We're not going to \u2013 we won't do that. But we will say, I'll reiterate, we're very confident in our position and expect we'll get a favorable outcome.", "Steven Chercover", "Okay. And it does failed to meet the test of materiality I assume?", "Russell Hagen", "We've not reserved anything related to this. Again we're very confident that we're going to succeed in this.", "Steven Chercover", "Great. Thanks, Russell.", "Russell Hagen", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. A couple of follow-ons. First, going back to the dividend, the fact that there hasn't been an increase in 2016, you mentioned a lot of moving parts and there was also the question on share repurchase and you mentioned wanting to have the Cellulose Fiber sale done as well. Should one read the fact that there hasn't been a dividend increase so far this year? Is that because the way fundamentals have played out or is that because you would want to wait to see to get the asset sales done [indiscernible] before that would even be contemplated?", "Doyle Simons", "Mark, as you would expect, we factor all of what you just outlined into a dividend decision will, as I mentioned, continue to work with the board to figure out what the right timing and what the right level is for a dividend increase as we move forward.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay. And then in terms of the AVO process, you indicated that the Southern analysis would be done well before the Western analysis relatively soon. Will you \u2013 when that part of the analysis is done, will that be shared with the investment community or is the intent to wait until the whole analysis is concluded?", "Doyle Simons", "Mark, as you would expect, we will be providing a significant update on that at our December Investor Meeting. So we'll tell you where we are, how we're thinking about it and how the South is playing out and maybe even preliminary kind of how we're thinking generally about the West. So all those details are still being fleshed out, but we will be giving a significant update at our December Investor Meeting.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay. Great. And then lastly, a real small one. But on the Uruguay, if you were to go forward with a sale, would that potentially be taxable or would that not be a taxable event?", "Russell Hagen", "So, the Uruguay assets \u2013 this is Russell, the Uruguay assets are held in the combination of in the REIT and the TRS, and so, we would have some minor tax leakage. We really haven't gone into that point yet, but we would expect probably some tax leakage because of the TRS held that assets.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Paul Quinn, from RBC Capital Markets.", "Paul Quinn", "Yeah. Thanks very much and good morning.", "Doyle Simons", "Morning, Paul.", "Paul Quinn", "Just a question on Wood Products. It looks like you did a very good job on the OSB segment a little bit \u2013 I don't know a little bit off versus our numbers on the lumber side. It looks like costs were up, I think you cited weather and capital projects maybe you could just outline what the capital projects you had in the quarter and how much of that was an effect on lumber cost?", "Doyle Simons", "Yeah. So as we mentioned lumber was off basically for three reasons. One was this lightly lower sales volume, second one as you just alluded to was lower operating rates due to weather and downtime for installation of capital projects and then the third and the largest to try to quantify this, which I think is where you're headed, Paul was the log cost increase primarily in Canada, but also in the West as we mentioned earlier.", "So, the downtime for installation of capital projects went for any one big project as you know we are spending roughly $300 million a year in capital in our Wood Products operations. Some of that's maintenance capital, but some of it's also capital that we're putting in to drive down our overall cost structure and we just had a couple of those projects that hit in the third quarter and there will be more of those in the fourth quarter.", "Paul Quinn", "Okay. And then I just had a question on Softwood Lumber, just trying to understand Weyerhaeuser's position on this. Without knowing quota levels or any kind of levels of taxation under CVD or AD duties, from a theoretical standpoint, what's better for Weyerhaeuser, a quota or a combined duty?", "Doyle Simons", "Well, I would say, ultimately a quota is the best for all parties involved because it's simpler, it establishes what the levels is, there's a certain level of certainty. So what we would like to end up with Paul, as we have said along is an agreement rather than having to go through the legal system and having a quota in place, very simple quota in place that sets forth the amount of imports from Canada into the U.S.", "Paul Quinn", "Well, thanks. That's all I had. Best of luck.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. Let me make a couple of closing remarks. As I've already alluded to, I just wanted to remind everybody that we will be holding our Investor Day on December 13, at the New York Palace Hotel. We look forward to that, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. And I would just conclude by thanking everybody for joining us this morning, and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Elizabeth L. Baum - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.", "On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $130 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.9 billion. Our third quarter results include after-tax special items of $129 million, primarily related to previously announced charges for product remediation.", "Excluding these special items, we earned $259 million, or $0.34 per diluted share for the third quarter. This is an improvement of over 20% compared with second quarter 2017 and 50% higher than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $569 million, 12% more than the second quarter and over 30% higher than one year ago.", "I am very pleased with our third quarter operating performance. Employees across the company worked together to overcome a variety of weather-related challenges and each of our businesses delivered strong operating results including another record quarter for Wood Products adjusted EBITDA.", "We also continue to deliver on our efforts to simplify our operations and strategically optimize our Timberland portfolio by completing the sale of our Uruguay operations for over $400 million and then October redeeming our ownership interest in the Twin Creeks joint venture and announcing an agreement to sell 100,000 acres of non-strategic Southern Timberlands for $225,000 per acre. We have also eliminated over 80% of the cost formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business and remain on track to achieve the full $35 million of reductions by year-end.", "Before I discuss our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues its upward trajectory. Although September housing starts weakened sequentially as hurricane suspended construction activity, single family starts rose 6% year-over-year in September and are up over 9% year-to-date. With construction labor temporarily drawn to the repairing model activity to support hurricane recovery efforts, we now expect total housing starts of approximately $1.2 million in 2017.", "With continued favorable housing market fundamentals including solid single-family permit activity, strong builder confidence, rising employment and wages, and consumer confidence at 13 year highs, we continue to anticipate steady improvement in the housing market for several years to come.", "Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $131 million to earnings before special items compared with $135 million in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $220 million. Western Timberlands delivered $111 million third quarter EBITDA, $13 million lower than the second quarter but $2 million more than a year ago. Fee harvest volumes declined 16% compared with the second quarter.", "Mandatory state fire restrictions limited working hours for our Washington and Oregon crews in July and August and forced us out of the woods completely for up to two weeks in September. This year's Western fire season was extremely severe, but we experienced no material damage to our timberlands. All Western Timberlands employees did an outstanding job of proactively assessing fire risk and rapidly deploying resources as needed, and less than 1,000 of our 2.9 million Western acres were affected.", "The severe fire season limited log availability, driving strong Western domestic market conditions throughout the quarter. Mill inventories remain tight and pricing for domestic logs improved moderately due to continued steady demand. Export demand also remained favorable, with higher log sales volumes and realizations across all markets. In Japan, year-to-date housing starts have risen 1% through August and post-and-beam starts are up 2%. Our customers log and finished product inventories are relatively low and demand for our logs remains solid.", "In China, demand is steady and pricing strengthened as customers competed against strong demand from U.S. domestic buyers. Log inventories at Chinese ports were stable throughout the quarter and remain within a normal range.", "Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $95 million to third quarter EBITDA, $4 million more than the second quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased compared with the second quarter but were modestly lower than planned as most Southern regions lost a few production days due to hurricane activity. We experienced no material damage to our Southern lands and our employees and contractors did an excellent job of safely staging equipment to avoid damage, and enable crews to resume operations as quickly as possible.", "Overall Southern market conditions improved during the third quarter as wet weather limited log availability, and Southern sawlog realizations increased slightly compared with second quarter. Our average log realizations were comparable to second quarter as third quarter included a higher proportion of pulpwood due to seasonal thinning activity. Forestry cost increased slightly.", "Northern Timberlands contributed $4 million to EBITDA, $2 million more than the second quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased seasonally, but were less than planned as mandatory fire restrictions curtailed harvest activity in Montana for nearly six weeks. Average realizations declined due to mix. Timberlands continues to make strong progress on its operational excellence initiatives and is well positioned to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for 2017.", "Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real estate and ENR contributed $47 million to third quarter earnings, an improvement of $24 million compared with second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA doubled to $74 million. The average price per acre sold was lower than second quarter, as third quarter included a large sale of lower value Montana acres.", "Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $241 million to third quarter earnings before special items, an increase of $3 million compared with second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved $4 million to $278 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled $117 million, $10 million lower than the second quarter.", "Sales volumes declined approximately 4% as we were forced to curtail operations at our Princeton, British Columbia mill for over a month due to a nearby forest fire. Log cost for our Canadian and Western mills also increased. These factors were partially offset by a 2% increase in average lumber sales realizations.", "Although log availability was challenging in the West due to fires and in the South due to extremely wet weather, our Timberlands and Wood Products teams work together to develop creative solutions and keep our mills running. Our Western operations expensed no log-related downtime in the quarter, and we lost only a few operating shifts across our Southern lumber system.", "OSB contributed $102 million to EBITDA, $15 million more than the second quarter and nearly $40 million more than a year ago. Average sales realizations improved 11% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes declined slightly due to a small increase in planned maintenance downtime.", "Engineered wood products contributed $50 million to EBITDA compared with $52 million in the second quarter. Manufacturing costs increased due to rising fiber prices for fiber, resin and OSB, and seasonally higher maintenance. This was largely offset by improved sales realizations as we captured most of the remaining benefit from price increases implemented during the first half of this year.", "Distribution contributed $12 million to third quarter EBITDA, $1 million lower than the second quarter, but $5 million more than third quarter 2016 despite direct hurricane activity in several of our markets. Our Houston, Atlanta and Jacksonville employees did an exceptional job of developing and implementing plans to keep our associates safe and resume operations as fast as possible following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. All three sites fully rebounded from storms with negligible damage and resumed normal operations within several days.", "Each of the Wood Products businesses is on track to achieve their respective OpEx initiatives, and we remain confident we will deliver collective benefits of $55 million to $75 million from this segment in 2017.", "I will now give a brief update on remediation efforts for our Flak Jacket product. We are absolutely committed to doing the right thing to take care of our customers and resolve this situation as quickly as possible. As of yesterday, remediation was complete or underway in over 80% of the affected houses. We expect the vast majority of the work will be completed by year-end with a significant portion of the costs covered by insurance.", "I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. Through most of the third quarter, Canadian softwood lumber imports were subject to preliminary combined countervailing and antidumping duties of 25% to 30%.", "On August 25, the countervailing duties which were assessed at approximately 20% for most producers were statutorily suspended pending the International Trade Commission's final determination of injury. U.S. continues to collect preliminary antidumping duties which are assessed at approximately 7% for most producers.", "The Department of Commerce is collecting and evaluating additional information to support its determination regarding final countervailing and antidumping duty levels. We expect that determination to be released no later than November 14. We anticipate the collection of countervailing duties will resume around year-end following the ITC's final determination regarding material injury to U.S. producers. The U.S. coalition continues to work closely with the Department of Commerce, and we remain hopeful we will be able to negotiate a quota-based agreement.", "I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter as presented in chart 12 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million higher compared to third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate fourth quarter fee harvest volumes to be higher than third quarter as we plan to make up most of the third quarter volume loss due to summer fire restrictions.", "We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase in the fourth quarter as demand remains solid and mills looked to build inventories in advance of winter weather. Japanese export log sales volumes will increase modestly compared to third quarter volumes while average sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher compared to the third quarter supported by continued solid demand in the Japanese housing market. Chinese export log volumes and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. Western road spending was delayed in the third quarter due to fire restrictions. Spending in the fourth quarter will increase as we expect to complete the deferred roadwork by year-end.", "In the South, we expect slightly higher harvest volumes as we make up for volume not harvested in the third quarter due to hurricanes and wet weather. We anticipate average sales realizations for the fourth quarter will be comparable to third quarter results. Forestry spending in the South is expected to increase as we deferred activities from the third quarter into the fourth quarter due to wet weather. We also expect hauling costs will increase as we compete with hurricane recovery efforts, which is increasing demand for truck transportation.", "In the North, we anticipate fourth quarter sales volumes and sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. As Doyle mentioned, on October 12, 2017, we announced the redemption of our ownership interest in the Twin Creeks joint venture and the termination of the management agreement, which will occur at year-end. The Twin Creeks activity was reported in Other Timberlands and will no longer be included in our results starting in the fourth quarter.", "Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to significantly increase as compared to third quarter as the fourth quarter is when we typically expect the largest portion of our real estate transactions to close. We continue to see strong HBU interest in activity across our markets, although transaction volumes in several Southern markets have paused temporarily following hurricane activity. We currently expect approximately $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business in 2017.", "Turning to Wood Products, we anticipate fourth quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to third quarter. Strong demand and low inventories throughout the supply chain have led to historically strong October pricing for lumber and OSB. Overall, we expect modestly higher quarter-over-quarter lumber and OSB sales realizations, and slightly higher engineered wood product sales realizations. Sales volume for lumber and OSB will be comparable with the third quarter.", "In addition, we expect a slight increase in log cost for our Western lumber production compared with the third quarter. We expect the decrease in engineered wood products sales volumes in the fourth quarter as well as higher input costs and increase per unit manufacturing cost due to planned seasonal and maintenance downtime.", "Chart 11 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of nearly $500 million. Cash from operations during the quarter was $323 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $97 million. And we continue to expect our full year capital expenditures to total approximately $435 million, $300 million for Wood Products, and $135 million for Timberlands. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically the highest quarter of capital spending. Investing cash flows for the quarter also included $403 million of proceeds from the sale of our Uruguay operations.", "Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with $6 billion of debt outstanding. During the quarter, we completed the refinancing of our $550 million term loan which was scheduled to mature in 2020, replacing it with a new $225 million term loan maturing in 2026 and prepaying $325 million.", "In addition, we paid down a scheduled bond maturity of $281 million during the quarter. Interest expense was $98 million in the quarter, a slight decrease from the second quarter due to a lower average balance of debt outstanding that resulted from the debt pay-down during the third quarter.", "And now, I'll turn it back to Doyle and look forward to your questions.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Russell. I am proud of our third quarter performance as employees across our businesses and functions once again worked together to overcome challenges and produce strong operating results. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering continued operational improvements and capturing the full benefit of market conditions to drive value for our shareholders.", "With that, we would like to open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And your first question from the line of Mark Weintraub of The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. Just one sort of maintenance fee type one. The $20 million in other in the unallocated items, was that reversal of LIFO or what was that $20 million?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Mark, this is Russell. That $20 million is really related one-time gains of sale assets and some operational true-ups, so we wouldn't expect that to occur in the fourth quarter.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. Any single significant one or multitude of smaller items?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Really it's multitude of smaller items. We sold some surplus offices and we had some true-ups on some gain calculations.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And any updated thoughts on Southern saw timber pricing and the outlook for next year. It does seem there's been an acceleration of capacity announcements for additional lumber. And just wanted to get your updated thoughts on where that supply-demand balance in saw timber is and when an inflection point might conceivably be reached and we get some improvement in pricing?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah, Mark. And we do think there's some potential for some pricing traction as we enter 2018, really driven by four things. Number one, as we mentioned, housing demand continues to grow and we are constructive on housing as we move into 2018. Secondly, as you just highlighted, more capacity is being added, and I'm particularly encouraged by number of recent announcements, including GP announced a greenfield mill in Talladega and said they are evaluating potential additions in Georgia, Texas or Mississippi, all of which would be good locations. Canfor said they are going to increase their Southern production by 300 million board feet and they're evaluating a potential greenfield mill in the South.", "I think this week's announcement of Potlatch and Deltic getting together and their intent to significantly increase lumber production. West Fraser's purchase of Gilman and their plan to increase capital spending, our 300 million board feet of additional capacity at Dierks and Millport that we've talked about. And all of that is on top of about 1.2 billion board feet of additional lumber capacity that's happening in 2017. So, all of that is good on the demand side.", "The other thing I would point out \u2013 or two other things I'd point out is the Softwood Lumber Agreement. We do fundamentally believe there's going to be less lumber coming in from Canada, either as a result of final duties or hopefully a negotiated agreement. And then the final factor is we're really encouraged by the development of the Southern export markets. We are now shipping to India out of Charleston, South Carolina. We're shipping to China out of the Wilmington, North Carolina. We're continuing to work to develop exports out of other ports including some in the Gulf South. And while it's still early on that, those volumes as we've previously said could be equivalent to a small mill in the 2018 timeframe. So, we think all of those factors are coming together. And as I've said, we are hopeful that we could see some pricing traction on Southern sawlogs beginning in 2018.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "That's super helpful. And lastly tying into that, as you think about the dividend is that mostly going to be determined by what you're expecting to happen in timber profitability? Or the strength that we've had in Wood Products, is that enough that it really does factor into your willingness to move sooner rather than later on the dividend degrees of magnitude?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Sure. So, let me give you some thoughts on that. Yeah. We are as we've said committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. And going forward, the board will continue to regularly review the dividend in light of a full range of external market conditions as well as our internal improvement.", "As you very well know, our largest asset is our Southern Timberlands, and we expect the biggest driver for a substantial dividend increase, will be improving pricing for Southern sawlogs as we just talked about, as that will generate a sustainable and growing earnings stream that provides strong support for the dividend over time.", "With that said, there may be opportunities for incremental increases before that occurs. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it.", "Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thanks a lot.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "I had a question on the OSB market. Prices have obviously rocketed up following the hurricanes. Can you give us a little color in terms of what you're seeing in the OSB market right now in terms of pricing and demand?", "And then, in terms of your ability to meet customer demand in 4Q, I think you said sales volumes in 4Q for OSB would be similar to 3Q. I think, normally, those volumes kind of fall seasonally. If you're running involves (24:01) kind of floppish sequentially, is that you're just running at higher operating rates or are you deferring maintenance or debottlenecking some capacity? Just any kind of color you can give on OSB market and your ability to meet customer demand would be helpful?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. So, you're exactly right. OSB markets have been very strong. And I would tell you current realizations for Weyerhaeuser are approximately $40 above the third quarter average, and that's been primarily driven by just underlying strong demand and thin inventories.", "Anthony, as we look into the fourth quarter, nothing customary what's going on there. As we said, we did take a little bit of downtime in the third quarter for maintenance. We'll take a little bit in the fourth quarter, but we're not doing anything to try to adjust from a market perspective. That's just how the maintenance fell during the year.", "But we continue to be optimistic about OSB markets. As we all know, we are moving into a little bit slower seasonal period, so that may have some impact. But we continue to be constructive on OSB markets as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, you announced the Twin Creeks exit earlier this month. Can you remind us why that didn't fit Weyerhaeuser's portfolio versus when Plum Creek entered that JV? And then, when you think about the opportunity to acquire timberlands, are you seeing compelling opportunities in the South, any specific regions, and is valuation an obstacle?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "So, Anthony. This is Russell. As far as Twin Creeks, you're right, that was originally formed by Plum Creek with institutional investors, and then Silver Creek was the manager of kind of the overall relationship. We did close on that transaction last April. Weyerhaeuser had the property management requirements for that, and then we retained a 21% equity interest.", "As we look at our 13-million-acre portfolio today and the strength of our balance sheet, we really don't need a structure like that to continue to grow the business. When we had originally \u2013 or when we had closed in April, we shortened the timeframe from the original 15 years that was negotiated by Plum Creek down to three years, with the intent of having a transition out of the venture, and we had the opportunity to exit the venture a little early, and so we took that opportunity.", "As far as acquiring timberlands. Go ahead.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yeah. No. Just from here on out, in terms of interest level and opportunities in the South, how do you characterize it?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Sure. We see strong timber pricing in the South. And fortunately, we're in every wood basket in the Southern market. And so we have an opportunity to see really everything that's coming into the market and then everything that's adjacent to us in those markets. So if we see an opportunity to acquire that fits our portfolio and creates shareholder value, we'll pursue that.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah. I'd like to actually, Russell and Doyle, just come back on that last question. I thought a couple of quarters ago that you were suggesting the real focus was on the integration of the two companies rather than acquisitions. Is that view now shifted as you get deeper into the integration of the two companies?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. Good question, Mark. And we're about 18 months into the integration of the two companies. I can tell you at least from my perspective, it has gone very well. We still have some work to do, but most of the hard lifting is behind us. As you know, we exceeded our original synergy target and continue to make improvements by implementing the best practices from each company. So as we look forward, we would consider potentially \u2013 potential acquisitions.", "With that said, we're going to be very disciplined, Mark, as we move forward. As Russell said, we are in every major market in the South. We have a good presence in the West. So, we don't feel compelled to grow because we are in every market, so we will be very disciplined, and look for opportunities where we can clearly create value for our shareholders through timberland growth opportunities.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "All right. And then, Doyle, just kind of turning to that Southern Lumber issue because you're correct. You pointed out a number of these initiatives that are out there, and from what we understand in the market, there's actually even more behind that potentially. Are you guys looking at any potentially a greenfield or the acquisition of more lumber capacity? Or indeed, what would be your view sort of overall on kind of growing the Wood Products portfolio?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. And so, as we look at potential growth of the company, as we very consistently said, we think our biggest opportunities will be in timberland. With that said, we would absolutely look at what I would call bolt-on acquisitions in the lumber business especially if it met up with our strategic footprint on our timberlands.", "In terms of growing capacity, I think our bigger opportunities, Mark, will be by investing in our existing mills, things like Dierks and Millport, as opposed to building a greenfield mill. As we look at the return opportunities from those two options, we think that's the best approach for Weyerhaeuser going forward.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Very good. I'll turn it over, Doyle. Good luck in the fourth quarter.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Hi, guys. Good morning, and thanks again for the details.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, George.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "How are you doing? I just want to pick up on the lumber capacity question that Mark keyed up. So, as I recall, Dierks and Millport add 8%-9% to your capacity over the next couple of years, and I remember there's one project comes on this year, and then the other one comes on next year. Can you correct me if I'm wrong in any of that? And what ability do you have to flex your existing capacity beyond this project in the 400-million board feet you're getting from it?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. So, you're right in terms of the timing. Dierks is in the process of coming on now. We'll see the benefit of that in early 2018, and then Millport is later in the year and into 2019. In terms of flexing our existing mills, George, the \u2013 we will continue to work on that. Part of OpEx, of course, is increasing the productivity and the reliability of those mills. And I would tell you we should be able to do that 2% to 3% on an annual basis, and we'll continue to focus on that going forward.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And, Doyle, on that front, you don't need to add shifts to get there, correct? That's just through improving the reliability, in theory, if you needed to. Even though, I know it's not necessarily a good thing from a safety and operating standpoint. You could add later shifts in the workday or a third shift or something to that effect. Would that be a fair assessment?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "That is a fair assessment. The 2% to 3% is just by running our mills more reliably. As you know, we're spending capital at our mills so that helps in some ways to run our mills more reliably. And that does not include any additional shifts.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. One question, can you let us know where currently realizations in lumber are versus your third quarter average?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. As I mentioned, OSB's current realizations are up $40 versus the third quarter, and lumber is up $15 to $20 versus third quarter levels.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Two more, and I'll turn it over. One thing \u2013 if we look at the timber outlook for exports, to Asia in particular, the next several years, are there any specific points that give you encouragement?", "And the question behind the question is, obviously, you're still largest in terms of your exports to Japan. Japan has been kind of a flat to declining market for U.S. exports, I believe, over time. And Japan has been growing its ability to supply its own timber over time as well. So, key points of optimism, if any, in terms of the Asian export market opportunity, considering what's been going on with Japan?", "And then, lastly, SG&A, it looks like you're more or less plateauing there after really a very good performance early in the OpEx program. Is there anything left to do there? Thanks. And welcome back, Beth, as well.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. We're all glad to have Beth back, so thanks for that comment. In terms of Japan markets, George, as you know, the big driver for us in Japan is post and beam construction. As we said, that is up roughly 2% year-over-year. That for post and beam construction, they need \u2013 the Japanese need the Doug Fir that we are able to produce and supply. And as you look forward, most projections have overall housing in Japan as you said flat, but post-and-beam construction continuing to grow and we are, by far, the largest supplier to Japanese saw-millers of the Doug Fir that's needed for the post-and-beam construction.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "And then as far as SG&A, as we mentioned, we've achieved $125 million SG&A target and that was related to the costs associated that we're going to remove from the Plum Creek integration. So, we're very pleased that we achieved that target, and then as Doyle mentioned, we're 80% into the $35 million of the SG&A cost related to what we call the stranded costs related to cellulose fibers. So, our $160 million target, we feel we'll meet that target by the end of the year.", "Going into 2018, we'll have a continued focus on SG&A. Our OpEx efforts in our manufacturing in the timberlands. We have a very similar mindset as it relates to SG&A. So, that's always an area that we will have a lot of focus on and looking for opportunities to improve and reduce those costs.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thanks, Russ. That's very helpful. Good luck in the quarter.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "You're next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Collin.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "First question from me, just going back to Mark's question earlier, maybe I'm posing a little bit differently in terms of the dividend policy adjustment to 85% of CAD over the cycle and again the prepare remarks about housing. Just more specifically, Doyle, where do you think the company and how does the Board think about Weyerhaeuser \u2013 where Weyerhaeuser is in terms of the cycle, early, middle, late innings? Just given that there's some moving pieces between the housing outlook, wood product pricing, how do you characterize that in terms of what inning we're in?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. I still think we've got a lot of runway in front of us in terms of housing, Collin. As you very well know, housing, it's historical average, about $1.5 million in starts. This year, we think we're going to be at $1.2 million. So I would say we're in the early to maybe mid-innings in terms of overall \u2013 the overall cycle because, as we all know, it's ultimately going to be driven by housing. And also, as we said in our remarks, we think for a number of years, housing is going to continue to improve. So lots of runway in front of us.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then switching to \u2013 thinking about CapEx and again in context of where we are in this cycle. I know, Doyle, in the past, you've kind of talked about some of the capital that has been put into the \u2013 really to the company on couple different fronts, and maybe seeing that kind of peak at this point in the cycle. Is that still consistent with your thinking or just going back to some of the prior questions about the opportunities that you see across the businesses, could maybe there be \u2013 maybe a longer runway of elevated CapEx, just given kind of the cash flow you guys are throwing off right now and maybe some of the opportunities?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. Collin, what I would tell you is we \u2013 our CapEx this year is going to be roughly $435 million, $300 million in wood products and $135 in timberlands. We're still working with the Board, but we would anticipate a similar type number in 2018. And then as we've also said, we think over time, we would see that start to tail off in our wood products business as we complete the projects that we're focused on and deliver on our OpEx initiatives and make our wood products business where it will be black at the bottom. And just to remind everybody, we believe we'll be roughly 85% of the way there by the end of this year.", "Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks, Doyle. Bye.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Collin.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Gail.", "Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC", "In your comments in terms of the fourth quarter, you mentioned repair and remodel, perhaps stealing some thunder from new home construction, and I'm just wondering kind of how you think that plays out as you move into 2018 because I presume we're not going to finish kind of all that repair work, and labor seems to be pretty tight in the homebuilding side?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. I think if you look at repair and remodeling markets overall, Gail, and I said \u2013 directly to your question, we continue to be encouraged there and those are up probably 7% to 8%. The remark we made or I made was regarding the hurricane activity and what we've seen in some markets is the labor that would normally be used to be building new houses is fixing houses that were damaged as a result of the hurricanes. I think we'll continue to see some draw from that as we move into 2018. However, some of the houses that were damaged were completely damaged and those will in fact be new houses that will show up in the housing starts number as we move into 2018.", "As you know, there's normally a tail on the amount of time it takes to completely recover from hurricane efforts and especially in Houston I would tell you I think that that's going to be somewhat of a tailwind in those markets through 2018. But there's no doubt labor continues to be the biggest constraint whether it's in the overall single family construction or finding labor available to work on the repair of the homes that were damaged from the hurricanes.", "Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC", "Okay. And just again kind of similar question, kind of looking past fourth quarter into 2018, but do you expect any material after effects from the fires in D.C.? And I think one producer yesterday said they're starting to compete a little bit in the U.S. with Canadian wildfires. Just how extreme do you think that might be over the next couple quarters?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "I think it clearly had an impact as we talked about in the third quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, that seems to be normalizing. So, other than the ultimate effect it's going to have on the availability of logs in Canada, which were already being impacted, of course, by the southern pine beetle, I don't see any specific impacts as we move into 2018 and beyond.", "Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC", "Okay. But it was kind of that log availability that I was trying to get some insights into.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Sure.", "Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC", "And maybe I missed it, but your comments on kind of the OSB outlook, I don't think you really addressed the new supply coming on and just if you could talk about how that fits into your outlook relative to current incredibly strong realizations there?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. So, as we \u2013 as I said, we continue to be constructive on OSB markets as we move forward. With that said, clearly, there is additional capacity coming online, and we'll see exactly how that comes online and what the timing is. One thing we know about OSB capacity is it's pretty lumpy in terms of coming online. So, I think there will be some disruptions and impacts on pricing as the OSB capacity comes online over the next couple of years.", "Frankly though, we're going to need \u2013 we, as an industry, are going to need some additional OSB capacity as housing continues to grow. So, there won't be an exact match, of course, between supply and demand and the timing thereof. But if you look \u2013 if you assume housing is going to continue to grow and then you look at the incremental supply that's going to come online, those should be fairly well matched. There will be some timing issues, as we all know, as we work through that.", "Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question if from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Just a question on the balance sheet. I think the leverage is down now. Net leverage is almost to 3 times. And it sounds like after you got the Twin Creeks proceeds, then you have, it sounds like, higher EBITDA sequentially in the 4Q. You'd probably be down, closer to that 2.5 times range to exit the year.", "So, I'm wondering if you've had any change of thoughts on where that leverage should sit and just kind of general thoughts about redeploying all the cash flow from the Uruguay sale. I know a lot of that was to pay down debt, but that obviously reduces the net leverage. Just any thoughts on the \u2013 where the leverage should go from here and whether it's the dividend or share repo or acquisitions kind of where you would sort of prioritize putting incremental cash to work now?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Sure. So, Brian, as we've stated in the past, our target net debt-to-EBITDA is 3.5 times. You're correct. We're now below that, and that's a function of we had some debt pay-downs this year. We're down to $6 billion of debt, and then we've had growth in EBITDA. And so, that's favored the ratio.", "So, as far as going forward on the proceeds, we'll look at the proceeds and we'll do our capital allocation program and really allocate that capital in the best way possible to create shareholder value. But that's something we continue to work with the Board on going forward.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "But Brian, I do think it's important to note that our financial priorities have not changed, continue to be consistent and, first and foremost, is returning cash to shareholders primarily through growing dividend, but also share repurchase. So, that's number one on the list.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's great. And then just on the Wood Products, it's obviously great performance with the run-up in product pricing, but also a lot of work on the OpEx side. I think last year you got about $65 million of OpEx savings this year that's sort of the midpoint of what you're targeting I think. And just \u2013 I know you want to get the 2017 savings in before you start to think about 2018 too much. But could we be in for another year in 2018 where there is something in that ballpark in terms of OpEx savings?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. We, as you would anticipate, are still working on that, Brian. But I would tell, I would \u2013 we would anticipate something in a similar ballpark. And as I mentioned earlier, by the end of this year, we're going to be 85% of the way to being what we call black at the bottom, and assuming we get a similar type number and have a similar type target in 2018 and achieve that target, we would be close to 100% of the being black at the bottom by the end of 2018. So, that's how we're thinking about things, are encouraged by the progress we made, know there is more work to do. And we're also encouraged by the fact that now mostly ideas are being bottom up driven, rather than top down driven, and that's also a very positive development for our company.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. That sounds great. Yeah. Combined with the cellulose fiber stranded cost removal sounds like a pretty good uplift from cost takeout there. And then, just on the \u2013 one last one on the Flak Jacket remediation, just trying to think about how the cash impacts of all this, as it sounds like you've spent $190 million in the quarter, and maybe there's some more to come in 4Q. Just wondering if you got any insurance proceeds yet or maybe the timing on when you'd expect to get that sort of can you kind of think about the impact to cash flows starting from October and going forward?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. Brian, what I would tell you is we expect to receive the reimbursements in 2018 and are very confident on our claim, and we will break those out on a quarter-by-quarter basis as those come in so everybody can track it.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. And, Brian, I would add, we've actually spent $60 million in the quarter. That's the cash expenditures.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. That helps. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.", "Thanks. Doyle, you said that the Southern land didn't get much damage from the weather. Do you have a sense of other people's Southern land? People we've been talking to don't seem to see a lot of damage in general.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. I would agree with that, Mark. And talking to some of our competitors, I think, unlike some previous hurricanes where you've been around a long time as I have, there was extensive timberland damage. I think that was mostly avoided with these two hurricanes. So, I think from an overall timberland perspective, we were very fortunate as an industry.", "Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.", "Just one more question. On the real estate acreage that you sold, could you give us a rough sense of how much of that was stepped-up land versus not stepped-up?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "We'd have to get back to you on the details, but a lot of the transactions that were closed in the last quarter were in the Montana area. And so, that property would have been stepped up.", "Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Super. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of James Armstrong with Armstrong Investment. Please go ahead.", "James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research", "Good morning, and congrats on a good quarter.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research", "First question is your Western log realizations, as you pointed out, are up really nicely year-over-year. Assuming a more normal fire season next year, do you expect the same pricing trend or should log prices stabilize a little bit more as we go into 2018 in the West?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. So, we're really encouraged by what we see out of the Western markets. I think there's no doubt that the fire season helped on a temporary basis. But as you look at the domestic markets, the log decks were \u2013 are thin coming out of fire season. I think more importantly from a domestic market, California housing continues to be very robust. Those permits are up 17%. And we think California is going to continue to kind of outpace the market because it lagged the market for so long. So, from a domestic side, we think demand is going to be strong. We are also, as we look into 2018, encouraged by what we see from export markets, both Japan and China. So, we're optimistic about Western log markets as we move into 2018.", "James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research", "Okay. That helps. Switching gear to Wood Products. You've addressed a lot of the questions. But do you have any insight on your customers' inventory levels? Have any of your customers really been able to rebuild inventories, or are they still tight after all the hurricane events and other \u2013 in the strong market?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Yeah. What I would tell you is customer inventory levels continue to be lean. Now, I would anticipate as we move into a slower seasonal period, Thanksgiving and Christmas and the winter months, you would start to see our customers have the opportunity to rebuild inventories but currently, inventories continue to be lean.", "James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research", "Perfect. Thank you very much.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes. Good morning.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Chip.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yeah. Doyle, my first question has to do, and I apologize if this was asked, but if you could talk a little bit about plywood. I know it's not a big business for you, but there's been some bumpiness with imports. And as I think about OSB and the fact that there's less and less substitutability or at least in practice, are you seeing anything that might cause plywood to maybe recouple with OSB, or at least be stronger than it's been in recent years notwithstanding that the last month, few months have been good?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Chip, we don't see anything that's fundamentally changed in those two markets. As you know, we've all watched them together over the past many years in the substitution from plywood to OSB. But as we look forward, we don't see anything fundamentally changing in that relationship.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then the second question is when you look at your distribution of cash, Doyle, and I know you talked a bit about this already, but there seems to be some reluctance to, I guess, to create a steady component of the dividend from Wood Products, and obviously, because of the cyclicality. But how do you wrestle with the fact that it's making so much money now and could continue to? And how do you balance between a stable dividend and distributing cash during periods of very strong Wood Products results, which frankly could persist for a while?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Chip, I'm not sure I would agree with the reluctance comment. What I would tell you is we very purposefully raised our payout ratio from 75% to 85% over the cycle to reflect the fact that we think we have raised the floor on our Wood Products operation due to the significant change we made in our cost structure. We will continue to work closely with our board on the appropriate dividend level going forward, factoring in Wood Products markets and the fact that we're optimistic on Wood Products markets as we said earlier and also, factoring in what we're seeing on the Timberland side. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And quickly for Russell. I don't know if you gave us the specific guide on the real estate EBITDA for the fourth quarter, but if you could just let me know that and what basis we should expect it would be?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "So, on the EBITDA, we're going to be at about $250 million. And then the basis...", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "For the year.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "For the year, excuse me. So, for the year, $250 million. And then on the basis, we would expect about 40%.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And that's for the year as well?", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Correct.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And everyone, we have time for one final question. And it comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, Doyle, Russell and Beth.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Paul.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "Hey. Two questions. One on Timberland portfolio. You guys have done a number of things in the quarter \u2013 in the past, selling Uruguay, redeeming Twin Creeks, selling $100,000 in the U.S. South. What can we expect going forward here on your portfolio? And I'm specifically thinking about the North, which historically hasn't been part of the Weyerhaeuser portfolio?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "And so, Paul, what I'd tell you and what we've consistently said is we're constantly reviewing our overall Timberland portfolio. We do feel good about the moves we made, both through Uruguay and Twin Creeks, as Russell said earlier, to focus and simplify our portfolio. But we'll continue to look for ways to create value for our shareholders going forward, whether that's through potential acquisitions or potential dispositions from a portfolio perspective.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then, maybe just a question on softwood lumber. Canadian companies seem pretty pessimistic on an agreement. In fact, West Fraser went as far as to say that Coalition seems unwilling to negotiate. I don't want you to get into negotiation on the call. But just from your perspective, what's stopping the agreement at this point?", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "I'm not sure anything is necessarily stopping an agreement at this point, Paul. As we said, we continue to be hopeful that we will be able to reach an agreement with the Canadians. We're working very closely with the Coalition and the Department of Commerce. We fundamentally believe that a quota-based agreement is the best option going forward for all parties involved because of the certainty and the simplicity that it brings to the tables. So that's how we're thinking about it and we'll continue to pursue and hopefully be able to reach an agreement with the Canadians going forward.", "Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Best of luck with that and your financials going forward. Thanks.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you, Paul.", "Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "Thank you.", "Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.", "As I understand it, that was our final question. I just want to end by thanking everybody for joining us this morning and, as always, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Weyerhaeuser third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Beth Baum", "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.", "On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. Weyerhaeuser delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2017. I\u2019m proud of the team work, dedication and creativity our employees displayed throughout the year, as they work together to accomplish goals, overcome challenges and deliver strong results.", "In 2017, we increased full-year adjusted EBITDA by 31% to nearly $2.1 billion; generated over $1 billion of Wood Products EBITDA, the most since 2004; captured nearly $140 million of operational excellence improvements; grew Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources EBITDA by nearly 30%; completed the asset value optimization process for Western Timberlands; delivered a 55% premium to timber value from real estate sales; exceeded our merger costs synergy target by 25%; and fully eliminated $35 million of costs formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business.", "We also further simplified and optimized our portfolio by divesting our Uruguay operations, redeeming our ownership in the Twin Creeks joint venture, and selling 100,000 acres of Southern Timberlands for collective proceeds of over $700 million.", "Finally, we increased our dividend for the sixth time since 2011, consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders through a growing and sustainable dividend. These accomplishments are reflected in our financial results.", "For the full-year 2017, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $582 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, on net sales of $7.2 billion. This represents a 40% improvement in full-year earnings from continuing operations.", "For the fourth quarter, Weyerhaeuser earned $271 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.8 billion. Fourth quarter results include a $37 million after-tax benefit from special items. Excluding special items, we earned $234 million, or $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. This is more than double our earnings for fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $551 million, 38% higher than one year ago.", "Before I discuss our business results in more detail, let me make a few comments regarding the housing market. The U.S. housing market finished the year on a solid note, as strong demand and favorable weather in many areas enabled building activity continue \u2013 to continue late into the year.", "Total annualized housing starts averaged $1.25 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of almost 7% compared with the third quarter. For the full-year 2017, U.S. housing starts totaled just over $1.2 million. As expected, growth in single-family starts was strong, while multi-family activity remained volatile.", "Single-family housing starts rose approximately 8.5% compared with 2016. Approximately 71% of total starts were attributable to single-family homes, compared with 67% one year ago. This mix shift is very beneficial for Wood Products demand.", "Entering 2018, housing market fundamentals remain favorable. Millennials are becoming more active in the market and homeownership among households headed by someone under age 35 rose to 36% in the fourth quarter from 34.7% a year earlier. Builder confidence is holding strong at levels comparable to prerecession highs. Permit activity is healthy. Single-family permits increased 9% for the full-year 2017 and total permits averaged over $1.3 million in the fourth quarter.", "Economic growth remains solid, employment and wages continue to rise and consumer confidence remains historically strong. Although constraints on labor and lot availability may provide some guardrails for the rate of building activity, our builder and dealer customers see significant opportunity to serve continued pent-up demand and are optimistic for a strong 2018. For 2018, we expect single-family housing starts to increase by nearly 10% with total starts approaching $1.3 million.", "Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 4 to 6. Timberlands contributed $166 million to earnings before special items, $35 million more than the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $252 million. Western Timberlands delivered $140 million of fourth quarter EBITDA, $29 million more than the third quarter and $39 million more than a year ago.", "Fee harvest volumes increased 14% compared with the third quarter as favorable logging conditions and strong production by our harvest crews enabled us to catch up on volume that cannot be harvested during the severe third quarter fire season. Western domestic market conditions were strong throughout the quarter, as underlying demand remained steady and mills rebuilt log decks depleted during the third quarter fire season.", "Pricing for domestic logs increased throughout the quarter. Per unit logging and hauling costs increased slightly due to higher contract trucking rates and additional high elevation logging.", "Turning to our export markets. In Japan, prices rose steadily throughout the quarter, as Japanese demand remained solid. Log and lumber inventories for our Japanese customers remain relatively low and they are running at high operating rates. Log sales volumes were comparable to third quarter and stronger takeaway was offset by timing of shipments.", "In China, demand for our logs remains steady and pricing strengthened as customers competed against strong demand from U.S. domestic buyers. Log inventories at Chinese ports declined slightly during the quarter and remain within a normal range.", "Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $101 million to fourth quarter EBITDA, $6 million more than the third quarter. Demand improved as mills resumed normal operations following third quarter weather events and our fee harvest volumes increased 6%, compared with the third quarter as we caught up on production days lost during hurricane activity. Average sawlog and pulpwood realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Unit transportation costs increased slightly due to higher fuel and trucking rates.", "Northern Timberlands contributed $9 million to EBITDA, $5 million more than the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased as we caught up on Montana harvest, they cannot be accessed, while mandatory fire restrictions were in place. Average realizations improved due to mix.", "Finally Timberlands fourth quarter results include a $99 million non-taxable gain on the previously announced sale of 100,000 acres of Southern Timberlands for $2,025 per acre. This is reported as a special item. The quarter includes non-earnings contribution from operation of the Twin Creeks joint venture due to redemption of our ownership interest.", "Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, Chart 7 and 8. Real Estate and ENR contributed $50 million to fourth quarter earnings, $3 million more than the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $13 million to $87 million. Fourth quarter transaction volume was slightly weaker than expected, as some activity paused due to buyer uncertainty regarding the several budget and tax policy.", "The average price per acre sold increased compared with the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales included a greater proportion of Southern acres, while third quarter included a large sale of lower value Montana acres.", "For the full-year 2017, the Real Estate business sold just over 97,000 acres, or approximately 0.7% of our land base. Real Estate significantly exceeded its 30% targeted premium to timber value, capturing an average premium of 55% in 2017.", "Wood Products, Charts 9 and 10. Wood Products contributed $221 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items, compared with $241 million in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $258 million for the fourth quarter and over $1 billion for the full-year 2017. This is the highest annual EBITDA since 2004 and over $150 million more than EBITDA from 2005, when we operated almost double the number of facilities and production volumes were over 60% higher.", "EBITDA for lumber totaled $116 million comparable to the third quarter and more than double a year ago. Average sales realizations for lumber improved 4%. This was offset by higher log cost for our Western and Canadian mills and a 5% decrease in sales volumes, as shipments from our Canadian mills were delayed due to weather-driven disruptions in rail transportation.", "OSB contributed $104 million to EBITDA, $2 million more than the third quarter and $58 million more than a year ago. Average sales realizations improved 2% compared with the third quarter. This price improvement was largely offset by 6% decrease in sales volumes, again, due to issues with Canadian rail transportation. Resin costs also increased.", "Engineered wood products contributed $34 million to EBITDA, $16 million lower than the third quarter, but $8 million more than a year ago. Sales volumes declined seasonally and manufacturing costs increased due to higher prices for OSB, fiber and resin.", "Distribution contributed $5 million to fourth quarter EBITDA, compared with $12 million in the third quarter. This business focused on managing cost and product margins and performed well in what is typically a seasonally challenging quarter.", "Fourth quarter results for the Wood products segment include a pre-tax charge of $50 million for remediation for our Flak Jacket product. This charge reflects higher than expected labor costs, resulting from the strong demand for home remediation services following Hurricane Harvey and Irma.", "As of yesterday, we have completed remediation in 99% of the affected houses. We continue to expect a significant portion of the cost will be covered by insurance.", "I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. On December 7, the U.S. International Trade Commission issued its final determination, affirming material injury to U.S. lumber producers. Final countervailing and anti-dumping duties became effective on December 28. These collective duties are assessed at approximately 20% for most producers.", "Fourth quarter results include a $9 million net pre-tax benefit from an adjustment for the final applicable periods and rates associated with the countervailing and anti-dumping duties. Final duties will remain effective for a minimum of five years unless reduced upon appeal by NAFTA or the WTO.", "Although Canadian producers have initiated appeals to both bodies, we expect the process will extend for several years before the panels reach a decision. The U.S. coalition continues to work closely with the U.S. Trade Representative, and we remain hopeful, we will be able to negotiate a quota-based agreement.", "Chart 12, operational excellence. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our Timberlands and Wood Products business achieved almost $140 million of operational excellence improvements in 2017. Timberlands delivered standout performance, significantly exceeding its $40 million to $50 million target. The business captured $66 million of operational excellence improvements, primarily from merger-related operational synergies.", "Wood Products captured $71 million of operational excellence at the high-end of its $55 million to $75 million target. Lumber and OSB met their targets with improvements of $21 million in lumber and $20 million in OSB.", "Engineered wood products and distribution exceeded their targets capturing $16 million and $14 million of improvements, respectively. Although we have captured almost $500 million of operational excellence improvements since 2014, we have more opportunity to improve our relative performance in each of our businesses.", "In 2018, we are targeting OpEx improvements of $40 million to $50 million in Timberlands and $40 million to $60 million in Wood Products, including $20 million to $25 million in lumber, $5 million to $10 million in OSB, $10 million to $15 million in engineered wood products, and $5 million to $10 million in distribution.", "Finally, we fully delivered on our commitments to eliminate the $35 million of costs formally allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business by 2017 year-end. Identifying and capturing these cost reductions require collaboration across corporate functions and operating segments and I\u2019m proud of the team work that enabled us to achieve this goal.", "I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook.", "Russell Hagen", "Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the first quarter is presented in Chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to fourth quarter earnings before special items.", "In our Western Timberlands operations, we anticipate continued strong realizations and favorable domestic demand. We expect harvest volumes to decrease modestly compared to the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter included additional volumes that were deferred from the third quarter because of fire restrictions.", "Japanese export log sales volumes and average sales realizations are expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter. We are seeing continued strong demand in the Japanese housing market combined with low-channel inventories, which is providing strong price support. Chinese export log volumes and average sales realizations are expected to decrease modestly compared to the fourth quarter on seasonally softer demand due to the Lunar New Year.", "In the South, we expect seasonally lower demand and sales volumes, and we anticipate average sales realizations for the first quarter will be comparable to the fourth quarter. We also expect higher fuel and trucking costs. In the North, we anticipate first quarter sales volumes will decrease, while sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter.", "Full-year 2018 harvest volumes for the South and the North are expected to be comparable year-over-year. In the West, we expect harvest volumes to decrease slightly compared to 2017, as a result of our previously announced exit from Twin Creeks joint venture, we will no longer have harvest volume to report in the category titled Other.", "Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter. In Real Estate, we typically closed fewer transactions in the first and second quarter of the year, as recreational buyer traffic slows during the winter months. The summer and fall months are the most active selling seasons with the large portion of sales closing in the second-half of the year.", "We expect Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter to be comparable to the first quarter of last year. We expect approximately $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources business in 2018. Land bases as a percentage of Real Estate sales should be between 40% and 50% for the full-year 2018.", "For Wood Products, we anticipate first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth quarter earnings before special items. For Lumber, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly higher. For OSB, we expect the average sales realizations will be lower quarter-over-quarter. Engineered wood products sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter.", "We recently announced price increases of 6% to 12% for engineered wood products, which we will begin capturing in the second quarter. Sales volumes and operating rates are expected to increase quarter-over-quarter for all product lines, as we typically have lower production in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and maintenance downtime.", "Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. For the fourth quarter, the decrease in earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter are driven primarily by an increase in non-cash charges related to intercompany profit elimination and LIFO inventory adjustments, as we rebuild depleted log inventories in our export yards and wood products mills during the fourth quarter.", "In addition, fourth quarter unallocated items include pre-tax special items of $42 million of insurance reimbursements for environmental remediation costs incurred in prior years and $14 million of Plum Creek merger and integration costs.", "Following the successful completion of the merger, we do not anticipate additional merger integration costs in 2018. For our pension and postretirement plans, the year-end 2017 funded status decreased by $138 million compared to 2016, as a result of a decrease in discount rates. Discount rates decreased by approximately 60 basis points for the U.S. plans and 20 basis points for the Canadian plans.", "We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2017, and we are not required to make any cash contributions in 2018. Cash paid for all other pension and postretirement plans in 2017 was $78 million. Our required cash payments for these plans 2018 will be approximately $60 million. We expect to record approximately $100 million, or $25 million per quarter of non-cash, non-operating pension and postretirement expense in 2018.", "Chart 13 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $824 million. Cash from operations during the fourth quarter was $354 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $160 million and for the full-year 2017 are $419 million.", "Looking ahead to 2018, we expect total CapEx will be approximately $420 million, $300 million for Wood Products and $120 million for Timberlands. Investing cash flows for the fourth quarter also include approximately $108 million of proceeds from redeeming our equity interest in the Twin Creeks joint venture and $203 million of proceeds from selling $100,00 acres Southern Timberlands to Twin Creeks.", "Moving on to debt. We ended the quarter with $6 billion of debt outstanding. Interest expense was $96 million in the fourth quarter. We expect interest expense will be approximately $380 million in 2018.", "Moving on to taxes. Following the enactment of the federal tax reform, we benefit from the lower federal tax rate on the earnings generated by our taxable REIT subsidiary. These earnings will now be subject to federal tax at 21%, rather than the prior 35%. The new law does not affect our REIT status, or the provisions that allow us to pay capital gain dividends to our shareholders. Further, we do not anticipate any limitations on our interest deductibility.", "In our fourth quarter results, the net tax adjustment was included in special items. The adjustment is primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets, following the reduction in the federal tax rate. We currently expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be between 11% and 13% based on the forecasted mix of our earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.", "Russell Hagen", "Thank you, Russell. 2017 was a strong year for Weyerhaeuser as we successfully completed our merge integration, further focused our portfolio, delivered improved financial performance across all our businesses and returned cash to shareholders by increasing our dividend.", "Going forward, I\u2019m extremely optimistic about 2018 and our ability to continue to improve performance through operational excellence, fully capitalize on market conditions and demonstrate disciplined capital allocation to drive value for shareholders.", "And now, I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first questions is from line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Mark William Wilde", "Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Mark.", "Russell Hagen", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark William Wilde", "Just to start off, I wondered if you could talk just a little bit about the markets, because we\u2019ve gotten off to a much stronger start than I would have expected here in January in all of these Wood Products markets. How do you read what\u2019s going on here?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, Mark, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m encouraged by what we see in the Wood Products market. If you look at lumber markets, you\u2019ve got growing demand from housing going up, and as I said, optimistic about what we\u2019re going to see in 2018. I\u2019m encouraged that the millennials are showing up, also anticipate strong repair remodeling markets. You\u2019ve got lean inventories. You\u2019ve got high operating rates. You\u2019ve got less lumber coming in from Canada and that was down roughly 5% in 2017 versus 2016, and now, we\u2019re moving into the stronger building season.", "So encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in lumber markets. Likewise in OSB, clearly have growing demand, driven by the same things I just outlined again, lean inventories, high operating rates. Now, we all know there\u2019s new capacity coming on. But I think, this industry should be able to absorb that capacity assuming demand continues to grow, which it will.", "Now there will be some volatility and lumpiness as that new capacity comes online. But the other thing about the new capacity, Mark, as you very well know, it takes \u2013 normally it takes longer to bring up new capacity, especially when you\u2019re bringing up capacity of mills that have been down for an extended period of time. So overall, pretty optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing.", "And then, of course, in engineered wood products, as we mentioned, we have announced a price increase of 6% to 12%. And we think in terms of that, we all should \u2013 we\u2019ll start to realize that in the second quarter and by the end of second quarter probably have half of that, or maybe a little more that we will realize by the end of the second quarter. So overall pretty optimistic about wood products markets.", "Mark William Wilde", "Okay. And then just as a follow-on question. Well \u2013 but this Western log market just is also surprisingly strong. I wondered, if you want to put any more color behind that? And also, is there any effect from the weakening in the U.S. dollar?", "Doyle Simons", "So, Mark, as you said, Western log markets have been very positive. We continue to be encouraged about what we see in those markets. Domestically, you\u2019ve got the strong demand and pricing improvements, and Japan continued solid demand low inventories. We anticipate higher prices and volumes in Q1 versus Q4. Post and beam construction was up, which is the key driver for us, I present in in 2017 versus 2016.", "And in China, we\u2019ll have a little policy here as we go through the Lunar New Year. But if you just look at 2017 versus 2016, log exports were up from the U.S. to China up over 10% and we can \u2013 we expect continued strong markets. Overall, it\u2019s a weaker \u2013 as we said a strong dollar is bad for Weyerhaeuser, or weaker dollar is a positive for Weyerhaeuser. So if the dollar does weaken, net-net that will be a positive for us overall in these markets.", "Mark William Wilde", "Right. Thanks, Doyle. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Randy Toth", "Good morning. This is actually Randy Toth sitting in for Anthony.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning.", "Randy Toth", "We\u2019re hearing a lot of commentary from companies that we cover in regards to freight tightness and labor tightness. I just want to know how you guys think that might impact you in the 2018?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, we like other companies are in fact seeing that type of tightness, as we mentioned in the fourth quarter, a real impact on wood products earnings as a result of transportation issues, specifically in rail out of Canada, but also in trucks out of Canada. And one mill, for example, that we have in Canada, shipments from rail were delayed by over two weeks and one much better from a rail perspective.", "So as we move into 2018, we think that will continue to be a headwind in terms of availability, but more so increasing rates, both on the truck and rails side. And we\u2019re going to work really hard to offset that through our operational excellence initiatives in 2018.", "Randy Toth", "Okay, thank you. And then can you talk a little bit about timber exports out of the U.S. South. I know, they grew quite a bit in 2017 although off a small base. How much are you guys participating in that, and do you think that growth is sustainable?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. We are participating in that and it\u2019s a key initiative for us. What we would tell you is, while you\u2019re right, it is off a low base. We anticipate that in 2018, our shipments could be three times higher than they were in 2017. And our best guess now is the takeaway that will go into export markets would be the equivalent, just to try to dimension it a small sawmill in the U.S. and what they would use.", "So you\u2019re right. It\u2019s off a small base, but growing. We\u2019re spending a lot of time and resources developing that market and are very optimistic about that market long-term.", "Randy Toth", "Okay. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos", "Everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details. Congratulations on the year Doyle and Russell. I guess, the first question I had, maybe piggybacking off of Mark\u2019s earlier question. So where do you see your customers log decks at present in the West? And overall, if you had mentioned, I\u2019d missed it. Where do you see lumber inventories overall in the channel? Do you think things are more or less back to normal? Are they still below normal in terms of average inventory levels, any thoughts that would be helpful? And I had a couple follow-ons?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. So if you look at lumber inventories, they are pretty lean across the entire system. If you look at log decks in the West, as you know, they got very, very low during the fire season. They have started to rebuild. I would say, they\u2019re kind of somewhere between low and normal, but log decks are being rebuilt in the West.", "George Staphos", "Okay. And Doyle, one question I had for you. On that subject, are wood margins high enough do you think across the market in the West present demand destruction on Western log? So in other words, are you seeing a sufficiently strong lumber prices out there and demand to keep pulling Western logs?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. The answer is yes. The \u2013 we have not seen any \u2013 what you would call value destruction from that pricing and demand continues to be strong. Where the competition is occurring is between domestic logs and Chinese logs, because as prices have run up, those are competing directly against each other. And the beauty of our system is, we\u2019re able to play that and thin logs to where we can create the most value.", "George Staphos", "Okay. Two last questions, I\u2019ll turn it over. One segueing off that comment and then comment just on OpEx. So one thing that we noticed in the deck and as always, we appreciate the detail. The Chinese export log revenue seemed to drop a bit more sequentially 3Q to four 4Q than it did last year just eyeballing it. And you mentioned, there\u2019s further sequential drop off in the first quarter coming up because of Lunar New Year, which didn\u2019t seem to have as much of an effect last year.", "Is there something else going on in China that we should be mindful of, or that you\u2019re maybe guarding against as a kind of a what-if. And then in terms of OpEx, congratulations on the performance there. What gives you confidence, I guess, four years into the program that with all the work you\u2019ve done in OSB and lumber that there\u2019s still more in the tank in 2018? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter.", "Doyle Simons", "George, in terms of what\u2019s going on in China, it\u2019s pretty simple that the reason it\u2019s down in the fourth quarter versus third is the strength in domestic markets. And as I\u2019ve just mentioned, we can swing back and forth. And as domestic markets have continued to improve, we are selling more to the domestic market and less to China. It has nothing to do with a falloff in China, as I mentioned, actually log shipment overall to China were up. And I mean, from an industry perspective, we\u2019re up 10%.", "George Staphos", "Yes.", "Doyle Simons", "And we\u2019ll get through this Lunar New Year and you never know what impact that will have, but we continue to anticipate strong demand in China in 2018.", "In terms of OpEx, as mentioned in the earlier comments, we\u2019ve made good progress. We have made good progress in 2017, but there\u2019s much more opportunity in front of us. But the reason I\u2019m so encouraged by what\u2019s happening in OpEx is, when we first started this program three or four years ago, it\u2019s very top down-driven.", "Now what\u2019s happening is, it\u2019s bottom-up driven. Our employees are out working in the mills, are out working in the Timberland every day are finding additional opportunities to drive OpEx improvements, that\u2019s how we\u2019re defining winning, that\u2019s how people are being compensated.", "So encouraged that we will be \u2013 can able to meet or exceed the targets that we\u2019ve laid out in 2018. Although, as you\u2019re exactly right, it does get harder. We\u2019ve got most of the low-hanging fruit and you did see the numbers in Wood Products come down slightly in 2018 versus 2017 which is indicative of that, but encouraged by the opportunities that we have in 2018 and confident we will meet those targets.", "George Staphos", "Thank you very much. Good luck on a quarter.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Russell Hagen", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Collin Mings", "Hey, good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning.", "Russell Hagen", "Good morning, Collin.", "Collin Mings", "Just to start for me. Just given the growing flexibility offered by the balance sheet, just maybe talk a little bit more about how you\u2019re approaching external growth on the Timberland front this year, especially just given the recent termination of the Twin Creeks JV?", "Russell Hagen", "Yes, Collin, this is Russell. As far as how we look at the timber markets, we have 12.5 million acres in the United States and we\u2019re in every major wood basket. And we have a team that really all they focus on is timber valuations and making sure that we understand kind of the relative values in the market.", "So we see everything coming on to the market. And if there\u2019s an opportunity that fits within our portfolio and we can create shareholder value, we\u2019ll take a hard look at that. But we always approach this in a very disciplined manner. Again, our goal over the long-term is to continue to grow the business and increase shareholder value. But we\u2019re going to do it very disciplined.", "Collin Mings", "Okay. Any sizable transactions out there kind of in the pipeline, or anything on that front?", "Russell Hagen", "There\u2019s a couple of transactions that I think will carry over into 2018 that were kind of in the pipeline in 2017 that didn\u2019t close. But beyond, probably what\u2019s in the broader news and what\u2019s available, I don\u2019t see anything else meaningful.", "Collin Mings", "Just sticking with the kind of capital allocation just on the debt maturing this year, Russell, do you plan to pay that off with cash and recognizing it, it\u2019s still early, but you got pretty meaningful maturity in 2019 at a pretty high-cost, just how are you thinking about the debt maturity here just when you\u2019re still well below your kind of targeted debt to EBITDA number?", "Russell Hagen", "Yes. So let me take that in a couple of steps. The first is, we do have $62 million maturity that we actually paid off yesterday and that was a pretty high coupon rate about 7%. We paid that off with available cash, because it really wasn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t make sense to go and refinance such a small maturity.", "As far as our $1.8 billion, I think that you\u2019re referring to are the future debt maturities. We have a lot of flexibility around that and we\u2019re well positioned from a balance sheet standpoint to address that when it comes up, but we don\u2019t see any concerns with that.", "As far as our leverage ratios, you\u2019re correct. We are \u2013 have a target leverage ratio of 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA and that\u2019s really over the cycle. So in some years, we\u2019re going to be a little lower and some years we\u2019re going to be little higher. Right now, we\u2019re a little lower and that\u2019s a function of \u2013 we have paid down some debt and restructured some debt, but we\u2019ve also had improvement in our EBITDA.", "So we see that. We\u2019re in a very comfortable position, and it provides us with a lot of flexibility should an opportunity arise and we want to go tap the capital markets.", "Collin Mings", "Okay. And then one last one for me just as far as on the Timberland guidance. Just given the strength particularly on the West just given log pricing momentum there that would start 2018, can you maybe just quantify how much we should expect in terms of the downtick in harvest volumes? I think in the prepared guidance remarks, you suggested that the West would be down and the North and South would be flattish year-over-year. But again, at least, in the first quarter which seem to imply a pretty meaningful year-over-year decline in the Western volume. So just how should we quantify that?", "Russell Hagen", "Sure. So, first, big picture. We\u2019re harvesting on a sustainable level. So in the West, as we mentioned at our Investor Day last year, the harvest will decline modestly in 2018, and that\u2019s really a function of working through the older age timber on the Longview acquisition. And so we\u2019ll see the harvest level, level out starting in 2018 and then we\u2019ll see moderate growth in that in 2023.", "Collin Mings", "Okay. And should we think about any other noise seasonality as it relates to those harvest volumes?", "Russell Hagen", "Coming into the first quarter?", "Collin Mings", "Just in the West in general, yes?", "Russell Hagen", "Yes. So in the West, we\u2019re going to have some seasonally lower volume in the West.", "Collin Mings", "Okay. I appreciate the color, guys. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Brian Maguire", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Maguire", "A couple of times, you mentioned some negative impact from rail and trucking issues in Canada in the Wood Products segment. I just wonder if there\u2019s any way you can size that? Is it like a $5 million or $10 million hit to EBITDA in the quarter, or more immaterial than that?", "Doyle Simons", "You\u2019re talking about in the fourth quarter?", "Brian Maguire", "Yes, in the fourth quarter?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, Brian, it was a significant issue in the fourth quarter, and it was primarily due to just the lack of trucking in Canada. As I mentioned, at one of our mills, shipments were delayed for \u2013 I said trucking, I mean, rail. So let\u2019s back up. So we\u2019ve got rail and truck issues, both of those were a problem in the fourth quarter. For example, one of our mills, shipments were delayed for a full two weeks due to rail issues, primarily due to the extremely cold weather in Canada.", "With that said, because of the surge in \u2013 demand in the fourth quarter for trucks, trucking availability was also a problem. So I would say, the \u2013 it was a probably $10 million to $15 million hit in the fourth quarter. Part of it was due to higher prices, but more so, we just couldn\u2019t ship the volume, because there wasn\u2019t rail or trucking available and that primarily happened in the month of December.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay, that helps. And then it sounds like 1Q maybe seeing some similar disruptions, maybe not just in Canada, but in the South, I know down here in the Gulf states, we\u2019ve had a lot of these winter storms we don\u2019t normally have. Just wondered if there\u2019s going to be an impact maybe in the Southern logs or Southern Wood Products that you\u2019re seeing so far in 1Q?", "Doyle Simons", "I think in 1Q, it\u2019s going to be more just higher cost as opposed to just not being able to ship. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, I do think rail and trucking will be a headwind, as we move into 2018. We\u2019ve not seen the disruptions in terms of availability that we saw in the month of December. But we do have higher rates going in and just both in truck and rail. We\u2019re about currently 60% truck, 40% rail. We will be shifting more to truck when possible just because as we look at the options that\u2019s the better one as we move forward.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. Just one on Southern log prices. It\u2019s sort of an area we start off thinking, maybe this will be the year we start to see a little bit of tension in the market and prices start to pick up. And since it\u2019s Groundhog Day today, I thought you maybe could give a little bit of an outlook on how you think that prices could go this year, if it\u2019s going to be more of the same, or do you think maybe by the end of the year we could start to see some upward tilt on those prices?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Brian, and I appreciate the color. Let me tell you how we\u2019re thinking about it. And we do think there\u2019s some potential for some pricing traction in 2018, and let me tell you why. Number one, it all comes down to housing demand, as I said, continues to grow. And we\u2019re quite optimistic that housing will continue to grow and we\u2019re especially encouraged about what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the millennials finally starting to show up in the market and frankly, that\u2019s what\u2019s been missing.", "We also expect a strong year from repair remodeling and are projecting that to be up roughly 7.5%. Maybe even more importantly than that is that, there is a lot of capacity being added in the South, as you know. It seems like every week, there\u2019s an announcement of new capacity that\u2019s being added, or at least being considered.", "In terms of the numbers, about 1 billion board feet of new sawmill capacity came online in 2017. There\u2019s another 2 billion board feet slated to come online in 2018 and 2019, and another 1 billion board feet on top of that, that\u2019s currently under consideration. Just to put that in perspective that\u2019s on a base of about 20 billion board feet in the South, so that\u2019s a big increase. And to your point, we already are starting to see some benefits in certain markets, where additional capacity has come online.", "The third part of this is, of course, on the supply side and there is less lumber coming in from Canada, I think, that\u2019s going to continue either as a result of the final duties, or negotiated agreements. Just to put that in perspective, that number went down from 33% in 2016, down to 30% in 2017. And as you look at just absolute lumber shipments from Canada, those were down over 5% in 2017 versus 2016.", "And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re very encouraged by development of Southern export markets. We\u2019re going to ship three times as much in 2018 as 2017, and as I mentioned, that should be equivalent to a small mill. So I think, all of those things are going to start to come together, and we are hopeful that we will start to see some pricing improvement as we move through 2018.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, again.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Steven Chercover with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Steven Chercover", "Thanks, and good morning.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steven Chercover", "So you gave us a little update on your views on Southern log pricing. And I just wanted to understand, if you could \u2013 for your specific projects that Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama, how they\u2019re going to kind of ramp up over the course of next year? So what\u2019s the timeframe?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, great question. So if you look at the two projects \u2013 our two big projects, let me start off by saying, just overall the capital that we\u2019re spending in our lumber operation should increase our productivity 2% to 3% a year. On top of that, the two projects, number one is Dirk\u2019s, Arkansas, that will start up this summer and as an additional 80 million board feet of capacity. And then our Millport mill, which we\u2019re rebuilding will start up in early 2019, and that\u2019s an additional 215 million board feet of capacity. So that\u2019s on top of the 2% to 3% that we\u2019re getting through the additional capital that we\u2019re spending.", "Steven Chercover", "Okay, great. And then one on the softwood lumber file. The recent \u2013 I \u2013 and then I recognize the big difference between airplanes and lumber. But does the ITC ruling between Bombardier and Boeing have any impact on softwood lumber file, because I mean, the Canadians are certainly trying to link it in the NAFTA talks?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. So we don\u2019t think that has any impact on the discussions. We, as I said earlier, remain hopeful. We\u2019ll be able to reach a quota-based agreement. And frankly, negotiations are temporary sidelined due to the focus on NAFTA. But we would believe those negotiations will remain separate from the overall NAFTA discussions.", "Steven Chercover", "So I don\u2019t recall if you\u2019ve ever specified what the actual volume limit would be with 30 billion board feet, or 20 billion board feet from Canada?", "Doyle Simons", "In terms of the limit based on what Steve? I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand your point.", "Steven Chercover", "Sorry. Well, I guess, if there\u2019s a quota that it\u2019s a volume limit as opposed to a market share limit so?", "Doyle Simons", "Now the quota that we have been discussing and again, it\u2019s still being negotiated would be a percentage, whatever it\u2019d be 25, 27, 29, whatever the number may be, that\u2019s the way the discussions have gone. It\u2019s not a hard limit on volume, it\u2019s a percentage quota.", "Steven Chercover", "Okay. Thanks, Doyle.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. First, just wanted to follow-up on the color you\u2019re giving, particularly on the lumber capacity in the U.S. I thought that was very interesting and helpful. You had mentioned 2 billion board feet in 2018 and 2019, I assume that was in each year, just wanted to clarify that?", "Doyle Simons", "That was the total for 2018 and 2019. And then on top of that, Mark, we\u2019re not factoring in the, as you know, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been saying, okay, we\u2019re going to do this, but the ground has not been broken and that\u2019s another 1 billion. So if you look at total 2018, 2019, it could be up to 3 billion.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay, okay. So I think, you said another 1 billion in 2020, and that was what you\u2019re referring to?", "Doyle Simons", "What I meant to say, Mark \u2013 yes, here is what I meant to say is 1 billion in 2017, 2 billion total in 2018/2019 with the chance that there could be another 1 billion on top of the 2 billion in 2018/2019 and that\u2019s to your point would probably show up in 2019, maybe some of that in 2020.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay, great. Thank you. And in curiosity, do you have handy a view on outside of the U.S. South? What net capacity change in North America over that timeframe might be?", "Doyle Simons", "Mark, I don\u2019t have those numbers here in front of us. I think, there will continue to be potential capacity that could happen in the West. In Canada, as we all know, I think, if anything their capacity going to shrink because of the lack of fiber due to the pine beetle situation.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay, great. And then shifting gears to real estate, two question. So you provided $250 million EBITDA estimates for 2018. I was hoping to get any preliminary indication on likely cost basis. And maybe just any color around that as well, given that that\u2019s only a little bit higher than this year and maybe I misremember. But I had thought the expectation was that that number would likely be going up, as you had finished some of the reviews during 2017?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. So let\u2019s talk about that. So what happened in 2017 is and we came in a little lower than 250 guidance, is there ended up being no federal dollars that were allocated for conservation projects. This is the first time in many, many years, where no money has been provided to the various federal agencies for conservation projects.", "And just to give you a sense of the magnitude, that directly impacted two deals, that would have generated approximately $40 million of EBITDA in 2017. As we move into 2018, we\u2019ll see \u2013 we\u2019re hopeful that that happens. But our guidance is based on there being little to no federal dollars that are put in place. So that\u2019s the fundamental shift as we look forward into 2018 chance, there\u2019s some upside there, but that\u2019s the number that we\u2019re comfortable with assuming no federal dollars. In terms of the\u2026", "Russell Hagen", "Yes, Mark, this is Russell. As far as bases, we\u2019re guiding to about 40% to 50%.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay, great. And just, Russell, just one clarification. I assume, when you had talked about there being a couple things in the pipeline on Timberland side that was an,industry or was that a Weyerhaeuser specific comment?", "Russell Hagen", "No, it\u2019s industry.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay. Thank you.", "Russell Hagen", "Thank you for that clarification, Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly", "Thank you, Doyle. Some of our\u2026", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Connelly", "Good morning. Some of our clients tell us that they see hurricane rebuilds taking away from overall construction activity, because too much of the available labor in those markets is shifting away. Can you give us your thoughts on that and what do you see \u2013 how you see that the sort of labor construction thing playing out this year, because you\u2019ve got a bigger [Multiple Speakers] assumption?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, there\u2019s no doubt that labor is the constraint. And as we talked to all of our customers, that\u2019s the one thing we hear over and over. I think in some of the select markets, as you had indicated, some of the labor that would normally be used for new housing is being used for, call it, repair and remodeling as a result of the hurricane.", "So I think that will put a little bit of a damper on housing in those markets, maybe in the near-term. Longer-term, there\u2019s a number of houses, as you know, that were completely destroyed. So those will end up in new housing. So I think, limited impact from hurricanes in terms of new housing starts in the short-term. Long-term, as we know, it always takes longer to rebuild from these things. But net-net, I think, that\u2019s just going to be another positive for housing as we move forward.", "Mark Connelly", "Absolutely. Just one more question. On the operational excellence thing, I\u2019m sorry to keep coming back to it. But the shift to bottoms-up opportunities, is this sort of a new leg of opportunity there? Are you going to start to tell us the operation excellence as targets are going up again? I just wonder if you could give us\u2026?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, it\u2019s a great question. As I said, if you look at over the last four years started off very top down driven low-hanging fruit. Now it\u2019s moving more into the things that are tougher but it\u2019s being bottoms-up driven, because frankly, I\u2019m not smart enough to figure out what the new things are that we can do, but our folks are.", "So, in terms of the size of the opportunity, we\u2019ll continue to identify those on an annual basis. I don\u2019t think, they\u2019ll be going up substantially. My best guess is, they\u2019ll remain at these levels for at least the next couple of years and then we\u2019ll go from there.", "Mark Connelly", "It\u2019s a good problem to have. Thank you.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman", "Hi, good morning.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Gail.", "Russell Hagen", "Hi, Gail.", "Gail Glazerman", "Can you give some color on where your Lumber and OSB prices are currently versus the fourth quarter average? And was there anything kind of mix, or timing-related that helped drive your pricing up not necessarily to it is relative to in the months trend?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. So what I would tell you is, on the current and these are quarter-to-date realizations versus fourth quarter, Gail. Just to give you a sense, Lumber is about $10 higher, OSB is about $50 lower, because as we know, we had a big run off. I would say, both Lumber and OSB are trending in the right way. And as we move towards the building season, as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, we anticipate that trend will continue.", "In terms of OSB pricing, Gail, and I think you\u2019re talking about the fourth quarter. I would tell you, there\u2019s a couple of things. Number one is, as you look at it versus the indexes, there is a lag that we have. And so, when things are going down, ours don\u2019t fall as quickly, so that\u2019s part of it. And then just, as you also know, we have some premium flowing product, which helps skew it in a positive way as well. So I would say, those are big \u2013 two big things.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay. Thank you. And on the Southern log exports, can you just remind us to what extent the destination markets overlap with where you\u2019re shipping from the last?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. The good news is there, they don\u2019t overlap at all. Now, let me clarify that. We\u2019re sending to China and India. So of course, we do send out the West Coast to China, but these are going to different ports and for different uses than our Western log.", "So there\u2019s no the term I use cannibalization of logs that are coming from the South into China versus the West. So some of them are to new customers in China, some of them are to existing customers, but that are either going into different ports, or and all of it is for different uses than the Western logs are being used for.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay, helpful. And just one last one. In terms of Western log market, do you have any perspective how much extreme weather, both in terms of the winter last year with all the snow and rain, as well as the dry summer might have supported pricing, and if we got kind of more normal weather as we move through the summer, what your outlook might be?", "Doyle Simons", "Gail, there\u2019s no doubt that the weather in 2017 was kind of a catalyst to get prices \u2013 well, prices are moving for the weather, but for prices to continue. I will tell you though, weather has stabilized. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to be very encouraged by what we see in the West and that\u2019s primarily from a demand perspective. Japan continues to be solid. China is strong.", "In domestic markets, primarily driven by California, and as you know, California was slower to recover now. California is going permits, they are up 15% in California and we think that trend is going to continue. So, whether it\u2019s going to cause some volatility. But if you just look at overall supply and demand, I feel it\u2019s pretty good in the West.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes. Good morning, Doyle.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Chip.", "Chip Dillon", "Thanks for all the information. One sort of couple of big picture questions. One is, could you just tell us, in your view, as you look at OSB and plywood, there has been decades of substitution out of plywood into OSB. And I guess, have we reached a point where there\u2019s very little substitution, meaning that all the use of plywood is basically in specialty areas, or in extreme cases, do you think several points of those markets could switch back and forth?", "And then I had a second question, if you could just talk a little bit about with the obvious high margins that lumber mills, I believe, are making in the South, in particular, and again that might get crimped in some point in the future, as you mentioned, as demand goes up for logs. Would it ever make sense for Weyerhaeuser to consider acquiring sawmills, just given that you would own them immediately and maybe it would be cheaper than building?", "Doyle Simons", "So Chip, on the OSB plywood substitution, you\u2019re right, I mean, we\u2019ve seen that trend over, over many years. I think, it\u2019s kind of in balance now. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be some temporary shift. But overall, I don\u2019t see any fundamental shifts back and forth between OSB and plywood.", "In terms of lumber mills in the South, as you said and you\u2019re exactly right, very high margins there. As we have consistently said, we would look at growing our Wood Products business on a go-forward basis. We think our bigger opportunity is in Timberland, but we will look at growing Wood Products business. I think, lumber would be a business that we would be interested in growing, especially if it tied in with our overall strategic footprint from a Timberland perspective.", "In terms of how we would grow, number one is, doing projects like Dirk\u2019s and Millport. And then secondly, would be exactly what you said in finding acquisition opportunities, where at a value, where we think we \u2013 at a price where we think we could create shareholder value.", "Going and building greenfield mills is probably not a step that we\u2019re going to take. But we would be very interested in sawmills to acquire assuming again, we could do it at a price where we could create value over the cycle. You can assume that the margins that are currently in place are going to stay that way forever.", "Chip Dillon", "Gotcha. And we hear a lot about the overgrown situation in the South, too much inventory, and you\u2019re giving some reasons why that could be alleviated in the near-term. But every county in the Southeast isn\u2019t the same. And could you maybe point out where you \u2013 where we should look for early indications of return in sawlogs, maybe particular states or parts of states that you kind of look for?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes, I\u2019ll just give you one example. There\u2019s a couple of new mills that have started up kind of along the Arkansas, Louisiana border. And as I mentioned earlier, we are starting to see some benefit in some of those areas, where you\u2019ve seen some of this new capacity startup.", "So that\u2019s an example of where we are starting to see some benefit and some potential pricing tension in that market, and there\u2019s a lot of markets like that across the South. The good thing about Weyerhaeuser, as you know, we\u2019re just about in every markets. So as that starts to happen, we will participate in that pricing tension.", "Chip Dillon", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Today\u2019s final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Paul Quinn", "Great. Thanks. Good morning, Doyle and Russell.", "Doyle Simons", "Good morning, Paul.", "Russell Hagen", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Quinn", "Just had a couple of quick questions. One on the labor issue side, whether you\u2019re seeing contractor inflation. Your contractors coming back to you and asking you for significantly more money, because they\u2019re having issues with getting labor on their side of the \u2013 harvesting \u2013 on the timber side?", "Doyle Simons", "We are starting to see a little bit of that. It\u2019s much more prevalent on the transportation side than on the actual logging side. But we are seeing \u2013 starting to see a little bit of pressure on their logging side, as well as we move forward. And as I said, I think, inflation, there\u2019s labor inflation or truck inflation, it\u2019s going to be a headwind for us as we move into 2018. And we\u2019ll just kind of work really hard to offset that through our operational excellence efforts.", "Paul Quinn", "Okay And then just turning to. U.S. South exports, what are your, and I might have missed this, but what are you looking at the Indian market and how do you view that market going forward?", "Doyle Simons", "Yes. The Indian market is \u2013 so as I mentioned, we are focused on two markets, China and India. India is currently the smaller of those markets. Unlike China, where we had a presence, this is a new presence, but we\u2019re spending a lot of time on the ground there. And we\u2019re encouraged by the opportunity that we see, and I\u2019ll tell you there\u2019s a lot of interest in that market. So, we\u2019re still in the early stages, but encouraged and think that\u2019s a market that has real opportunity to grow as we move into 2018 and beyond.", "Paul Quinn", "Great. That\u2019s all I had. Best of luck, guys.", "Doyle Simons", "Thank you.", "Russell Hagen", "Thank you.", "Doyle Simons", "As I understand it, that was our final question. Let me end by thanking, everybody, for joining us this morning.
