You\u2019ve joined Zions Bancorporation Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.", "James Richard Abbott", "Thanks, Latif, and good evening to all of you. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2016 fourth quarter and full-year earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer.", "I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.", "The earnings release, the related slide presentation, and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals and have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.", "We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer section. We ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "I'll now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. Harris?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Thank you very much, James, and welcome to all of you to join our call today to discuss our fourth quarter results. I\u2019m going to begin on Slide 3, where we\u2019ve some highlights for the quarter. Just note that earnings per share increased $0.60 from $0.43 per share in the year-ago quarter, a 40% increase.", "Also note that 25% increase in pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue that reflects our continued achievement of strong operating leverage as we\u2019ve maintained tight expense control, while generating a 7.2% increase in adjusted revenue over last year's fourth quarter. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation, and as well, Paul Burdiss in a little more detail.", "Turning to Slide 4, I am very pleased to report that for the second year of the three-year plan that we articulated back in June of 2015, we\u2019ve accomplished all of our established goals. Financial goals were fairly aggressive. We worked very hard on many fronts to accomplish them.", "As we look to 2017, we're again committing to further improvement of the efficiency ratio to the low 60s. We expect non-interest expense to increase slightly in the 2% to 3% range relative to the reported figure of 2016, which is consistent with our commitment made back in the mid-2015.", "On Slide 5, we're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is a result of both solid net interest income growth which as noted increased 7.1% over the fourth quarter a year-ago, and 8.1% and 5.8% improvement in GAAP and adjusted non-interest income respectively with the primary adjustments to GAAP measures being the elimination of securities gains and losses and fair value of non hedge derivative income.", "Both of these revenue results were consistent with our targeted objectives, although much of the improvement in the net interest income came from the growth income from the securities portfolio. And we're working hard to make changes that will cause interest income from loans to shoulder more of the burden of growth for 2017 and beyond.", "GAAP non-interest expense increased 1.8% and adjusted non-interest expense decreased 0.6%, respectively. All of this is resulted in this 25% improvement in pre-provision net revenue over the prior year fourth quarter as previously noted.", "Turning to Slide 6, we posted an efficiency ratio of 64.5% in the fourth quarter and 65.8% for the full-year. Our goal for 2016 was to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66%, while maintaining adjusted non-interest expense below $1.58 billion. We encourage some expenses in 2016 that were outside of our planned estimates, such as accelerated retirement benefits, elevated healthcare costs, and moderate legal accruals.", "However, at our Investor Day, in February 2016, I committed to you that we'd adjust the executive compensation downward if necessary in order to achieve the efficiency ratio on non-interest expense goals. And primarily as a result of higher healthcare costs in the fourth quarter, we accordingly made some modest downward adjustments to senior management incentive compensation in the quarter as disclosed further in the earnings release.", "But also note that we are achieving all of this while making very substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects. We will continue to work hard beyond 2017 to identify additional opportunities to become more efficient.", "Moving to Slide 7, we experienced soft loan growth in the fourth quarter due in part to constraints on growth in our commercial real estate portfolio as a result of internal concentration limits and continued attrition in oil and gas loans, which declined more than a $150 million in the fourth quarter and more than $460 million over the year-ago period. We're optimistic that we'll see improved growth as we move through 2017.", "Before I leave Slide 7, it's worth noting that we did experienced very strong deposit growth in the fourth quarter. Some of this is seasonal and include some large deposits by a small number of customers and we\u2019ve already seen substantial reversal with some of that spike in deposit growth in the first quarter -- we\u2019ve seen some reversal in the first quarter.", "Slide 8, depicts the credit quality metrics of about 95% of our loan portfolio, but exclusive of the oil and gas segment which is about 5% of our total loan portfolio. We've historically had strong credit performance in our loan portfolio and we're determined to be a strong performer relative to the industry in the next credit cycle.", "We don't currently see significant problems developing in any of our markets. Overall credit quality results were relatively consistent with those we reported in the prior quarter with a slight increase in non-performing loans and classified loans, but a decline in criticized loans.", "Net charge-offs in the portfolio, excluding energy loans were less than $1 million for the full-year on a portfolio with an average $39.6 billion. We nevertheless recognize that it's unlikely that every year will be as pristine as 2016 was for this non-energy segment. So we're incorporated -- incorporating into our outlook some modest increase in losses for 2017.", "Slide 9 is the depiction of the credit metrics for the oil and gas portfolio. We are becoming more optimistic about the outlook for losses and problem credit levels over the next several quarters as we're seeing some favorable indicators both within our portfolio and in the industry generally.", "The metrics took a decisive turn for the better in the fourth quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, criticized, classified, and nonaccrual oil and gas loan levels declined 16% to 11% and 15%, respectively. As a result, we feel comfortable, modifying our outlook on provisions for the next four quarters to a level somewhat lower than what we\u2019ve reported for 2016.", "With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer to further review the financial results. Paul?", "Paul E. Burdiss", "Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $125 million or $0.60 per share. That's up from $0.43 per share in the year-ago period. We highlighted pre-provision net revenue, which increased 25% from the year-ago period as Harris discussed.", "I'll also draw your attention to two key big picture profitability measures. First, return on assets has increased to 89 basis points, up from 68 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Return on average tangible common equity increased to 8.4% from 6.2% in the year-ago period.", "We are committed to improving these measures of balance sheet profitability over the next couple of years and we are certainly encouraged by the recent improvement. The last item highlighted on this page is the efficiency ratio, which Harris already discussed in some detail.", "I'll make a few comments about revenue first [ph]. About three quarters of our revenue comes from net interest income driven primarily by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer related funding. Slide 11 is a graphical depiction of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. As a reminder, the size of the circles represent the relative size of loan portfolios.", "We experienced 6% growth in non-oil and gas, commercial and industrial loans. However, in the fourth quarter, these increased by about 1.7% on an annualized basis which we acknowledge as disappointing. As we had discussed in previous calls and at investor presentations, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward and indeed in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter CRE loans declined about 1% with the primary driver being our commitment to hold fast to our portfolio concentration limits.", "We achieved 9% year-over-year growth in both 1-4 family mortgage and home equity loans, which is consistent with our desire for stronger growth in these portfolios. Such loans increased at an annualized basis of 7% and 10% from the prior quarter levels, respectively.", "We expect non-oil and gas commercial and industrial, and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the national real estate group loans and oil and gas portfolio loans. Although we expect a decline in 2017 from both portfolios to be less than that experienced in 2016.", "Slide 12 outlines the recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate growth in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 7.1% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by a $5 billion increase of the investment portfolio \u2026", "Harris H. Simmons", "In the average balance.", "Paul E. Burdiss", "\u2026 in the average balance of the investment portfolio, thank you. Interest income from loans increased $8 million over the prior period or 1.9% increase. While average loan balances were up $2.3 billion or 5.7%, the yield on loans declined 13 basis points from the year-ago period. The decline in the loan yield was due to a change in the composition of our loan portfolio which migrated toward modestly lower yielding loans such as residential mortgages and also due to a decline in income from purchase credit impaired loans.", "As shown in the box at the bottom right of that slide, Page 12, we remain positioned to benefit from rising rates. However, during the past two years, we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into highly liquid fixed-rate securities which reduced our interest rate sensitivity somewhat using the midpoint of the range shown a 25 basis point increase in the yield curve -- across the yield curve would produce approximately $20 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the size and composition of the balance sheet. It will take a few quarters for the impact of a short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized, as only about half of our loan portfolio is indexed to short-term LIBOR or prime.", "Slide 13 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We accelerated the purchases of high-quality liquid securities during the fourth quarter, increasing the securities portfolio by $3.2 billion. We expect to continue to purchase securities at similar pace through the first quarter of 2017 and we will continue to evaluate the company\u2019s interest rate risk profile as one of two key drivers of the size of the investment portfolio. The primary driver being the need to have substantial on balance sheet liquidity.", "As a reminder, the size of the securities portfolio is not constrained by the level of cash on the balance sheet. We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration and extension risk. The mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about four years with a duration extension risk being only about half a year if rates were to rise by 200 basis points.", "The duration of the entire securities portfolio including floating rate SBA securities, is about 3.2 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree which is attributable to our discipline in purchasing MBS with limited extension risk and because the floating rate small business administration securities held in the portfolio are expected to prepay at a faster rate as the economy strengthens and rates rise.", "Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yield of the investment portfolio and the loan production can be found on Slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which was stable from the prior quarter at 4.11%. Income from loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009 was essentially unchanged relative to the prior quarter. The securities portfolio yield increased slightly this quarter attributable to reduced premium amortization as compared to the prior quarter due largely to a steeper yield curve. Our cost of deposits did not change relative to the prior quarter.", "Turning to Slide 15 and noninterest income, total noninterest income equaled $128 million, up from $119 million a year-ago, which is roughly consistent with our targeted objective, but down from $145 million in the prior quarter. There were a couple of items worth noting that cause the decline from the prior quarter. First, in the prior quarter, you may recall, approximately $11 million of that income was attributable to strong valuation performance of a publicly traded company held in the Zions small business investment company portfolio. And we said at the time that we do not expect that income to recur or at least not regularly recur that source of income or loss as was the case this quarter is found in both the dividends and at the other investment income line items and in the equity securities gains and losses line item.", "Secondly, the fair value and non-hedged derivative income line increased $7 million in the quarter, most of which was attributable to changes in the interest rate environment which cause customer related swaps to experience a mark-to-market increase in value.", "Finally, loan sales and servicing declined from the prior quarter due in part to adverse valuation marks on mortgage loan rate lock commitments. This was about $2 million of contra revenue in the fourth quarter compared to $1 million of positive revenue mark in the third quarter.", "Noninterest expense on Slide 16 increased 1.8% from the prior year, and if adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in the GAAP to non-GAAP table at the back of the press release and earning slides, noninterest expense declined 0.6% from the year-ago period.", "During the quarter, we experienced some expense that was not fully anticipated. However, as Harris noted in his earlier remarks, elevated fourth quarter noninterest expense directly resulted in management incentive compensation that was $5 million less than planned in the fourth quarter.", "As detailed on the slide, we expect total adjusted noninterest expense to increase between 2% and 3% in full-year -- fiscal year '17 -- full-year '17 when compared to full-year 2016 results. It's worth reminding everyone that there is seasonality to noninterest expenses, particularly with regard to the first quarter compensation related items.", "On Slide 17, is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. We are fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage and we believe at this point with more than 20% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a noticeable difference.", "We are committed to the substantial simplification of our operating process -- processes. We continue to work hard to upgrade our technology systems which we expect will result in an improved loan and deposit and customer information infrastructure. When complete, this information should simplify our back office, provide additional data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers and better enable us to adopt enhanced digital capabilities.", "Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what we\u2019ve seen today, and we are tracking towards those goals as discussed earlier. Regarding returns on capital, we are pleased to have made progress and returning more capital to shareholders. Of note, we have repurchased nearly 3 million shares or about 1.4% of shares outstanding at June 30.", "Although it is premature to give specific guidance on our expectations for CCAR 2017, the results of our internal stress testing indicated that we have an opportunity to optimize our capital position to be more reflective of the manageable risks in the Company. Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach.", "Slide 18 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which could be interpreted as an annual rate of growth in the mid single-digit range. We continue to expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high single-digit range, driven primarily by loan and investment securities growth. No additional rate hikes are assumed in this outlook, although additional increases in short-term rates are expected to improve net interest income.", "Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a provision of less than $1 million in the fourth quarter, which includes the provision for both funded and unfunded loan commitments. So while we have the word increasing to describe the outlook for the next four quarters relative to the fourth quarter, we are increasingly optimistic that the credit deterioration we experienced from the oil and gas portfolio has turned the corner.", "As Harris mentioned earlier, we don't think that 0.2 basis points of net charge-offs on the non-oil and gas portfolio for the full-year 2016 is sustainable. So as energy credit costs decline and we experienced a reduction in the reserve on that portfolio, we may experience a slight deterioration in the rest of the loan portfolio. When combined with provisions for our new loan growth, we feel comfortable with our outlook for a total provision expense including both funded and unfunded loans, of something similar to that which we experienced in 2016.", "We expect the customer related fees, which are defined in our press release and exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, should increase moderately from the level reported in the fourth quarter. We currently expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase in 2017 between 2% and 3% relative to the 2016 reported levels.", "We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 34% to 35% range in 2017 barring any meaningful changes in the tax code. We expect preferred dividends to be approximately $40 million in 2017. And as mentioned in my remarks earlier, we do anticipate redeeming up to $144 million of higher cost preferred equity in the first half of 2017. In light of the recent increase in our share price, this is a new outlook item that is diluted shares.", "Zions stock appreciated from an average price near $30 in the third quarter to a current price in the low 40s. As you are likely aware, we\u2019ve approximately 35 million warrants outstanding. 5.8 million TARP warrants and 29.3 million warrants issued in 2010 to supply common equity capital to the Company at that time. The warrants have a strike price of around $36. The exact details and link to the prospectuses for those warrants are provided on our Web site under the warrant information link on the homepage.", "As the average stock price rises and the weighted average strike price above the weighted average strike price, warrants increased diluted shares outstanding and are therefore dilutive to earnings per share. We\u2019ve identified in the appendix that Slide 21, which provides a view of the approximate dilution for each dollar movement in the average share price.", "If the stock price would average in the first quarter near where it is today, we would expect the diluted share count to increase to approximately 210 million shares which is net of the share repurchase -- purchases we anticipate in the first quarter.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your question please.", "John Pancari", "I just want to ask about the efficiency ratio expectation. I know you\u2019re indicating your -- reiterating your commitment to the low 60s level for 2017 and that you came in around 65% ballpark for '16. And getting first that low 60s, can you just give us an idea of what that would interpret into? Is that a good way to think of it 60% to 63%, is that a fair assumption?", "Paul E. Burdiss", "Well, I think -- yes, clearly those numbers are in the low 60s. We\u2019re not going to give a knife edge kind of number in part, because we think we're getting to a place where we\u2019re going to be competitive in the industry. And low 60s isn't where we want to stop, I'll also say that. This isn't about trying to find a floor. But we also want to -- fundamentally I\u2019m wanting to be a little cautious about creating such a focus on that number that it could lead to perverse kinds of behaviors in the Company. We\u2019ve seen what incentives can do to cultures recently and I just don\u2019t want to have anything that's going to tip anybody over the edge in terms of doing something unnatural. So I am going to leave it kind of at that, low 60s is what we said we do a year and a half ago and that's where we intend to be. You will all have to judge whether we meet your expectations as to what that number means, but that\u2019s the reason for it.", "John Pancari", "Okay. Yes, what I was getting at is that, if it is let's call it 63% the high end of that, that\u2019s 200 basis points of improvement off of this year without any incremental assumed Fed hike. So, I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, where does that come from without the help of the Fed?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Well, you do have the Fed hikes that we had in December we anticipated that we were quite clairvoyant back in June '15 and understanding that the Fed was going to do that in December. As you recall, we had actually basically assumed that we would have one in December of '15 and one in December '16, which I think makes us more accurate than the Fed has been. But beyond that, we still have room for some securities growth. We expect we will see some resumption of some loan growth, and there will be a lot of continued focus on expense management. So anyway, we thought hard about the budget for this place, and it gets us to the place we think we need to be and we think it's doable.", "Scott J. McLean", "I would just -- this is Scott, John. I would just add to that that the fundamentals that we laid out in that June 1 2015 announcement as Harris notes about the repositioning of cash, loan growth, fee income growth keeping expenses flat and the term we have used for 2017 back then was slightly increasing in 2017. All of that without rate increases just like in '16 \u2026", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yes, beyond what we plugged in.", "Scott J. McLean", "What we had plugged in, right. The two rate increases that we\u2019ve plugged in December of '15 and '16. All of that just like we saw in '16, should allow us to continue to improve the efficiency ratio in '17.", "John Pancari", "Okay, great. All right. Thank you.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Your question please.", "Erika Najarian", "Hi, good evening.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Hi, Erika.", "Erika Najarian", "My question is on the CCAR. So there has clearly been a lot of momentum even before the election to raise the definition of a domestic SIFI from $50 billion to $250 billion. And I\u2019m wondering if that happens, other than obviously returning more of your excess capital to shareholders, is there anything strategically that you are doing now that is dictated by CCAR and previous CCAR results that you may be doing differently? And I guess maybe I\u2019m specifically thinking about, you talk about moderate growth in C&I and CRE, and I wonder how much of risk management is -- the regular prudent risk management that Zions management is used to executing versus something more stringent that is attributable to the current regulatory environment?", "Harris H. Simmons", "I guess -- let me take a stab at giving you my point of view. This is Harris. I think that as we talked about concentration limits for commercial real estate, I think we have made some changes during '16, particularly around multifamily as we have been -- became increasingly concerned that the rate of growth and that product type was not sustainable across the economy, and -- but more generally commercial real estate as a category is something that we are trying to be very prudent about. We are seven or eight years into a cycle, and while we don't see anything that -- I mean I actually think it's been a pretty responsible cycle. This credit behavior goes by peers and by what we see out in the marketplace. Nevertheless, I mean, we are deep into a cycle and so we\u2019re going to be careful about that. But I would say CCAR creates uncertainty that may incrementally create a little more caution here than we'd otherwise have. So we wouldn\u2019t -- we wouldn\u2019t don't want to behave recklessly. If we are not subject to CCAR I don't think it's going to change our behavior in any material way, but it probably gives us one last thing to be concerned about if you, because it's been such a precipitous. Now you get it wrong, it was -- it became kind of a nuclear event as we saw back in 2014. And so, that would be obviously welcome. We\u2019ve expressed before, we don't think that the Federal Reserve's levels are really built for a regional bank like ours. We think we have a different balance sheet mix and we think we would very much like to be able to use our own models that would continue to have regulatory oversight to help us think about risk appetite and the tolerances we have. And so, being relieved of the SIFI status would certainly be helpful in that respect. So I hope that's helpful. But it's not that we would -- you wouldn't see wild abandon here.", "Erika Najarian", "That was helpful. Just a follow up to that, how do you think if the SIFI buffer was raised, your expenses can potentially progress or is there any low hanging fruit in the regulatory side that could potentially be reinvested or go away your thoughts on that.", "Paul E. Burdiss", "Well, I think a lot of the expense was in building the framework and models. And there is clearly some cost to maintaining them to keeping them current, and I don\u2019t expect that we are going to jettison that framework. It's what we are using to run the Company today. But there are things, including for example the resolution plan, the annual cadence of this will become a little less expensive. So I think again, incrementally it would help. It would have been really helpful if we had this for years ago before we invest a lot of money in creating incredibly comprehensive modeling capability. So I expect that we go to a maintenance mode more than a continued investment mode in all of this. And that would be helpful, but it's not going to be a material big step change, if you will.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Eads of UBS. Your line is open.", "David Eads", "Hi good afternoon.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Good afternoon.", "David Eads", "Maybe -- could you talk a little bit about kind of the direction or the pace of bringing down the asset sensitivity, you talked about it. We can see it coming down this quarter, and I guess it seems like you are going to continue adding more securities and then obviously adding the mortgages on the balance sheet. And I guess, when we think about what the limiting factors you guys looking at? Is it kind of the average of the sensitivity in the slow and fast deposit beta [ph] scenarios or is it certain amount of two another rate hike. How do you guys think about that?", "Paul E. Burdiss", "Well, this is Paul, David. We have an [indiscernible] committee that meets on a regular basis, so we consider balance sheet sensitivity in the context of the shape of the yield curve and kind of the return that we can earn or that we might be leaving on the table as it relates to the -- relative size of the duration of the asset and liability side of balance sheet. So I wouldn't say explicitly that there is a target other than to say in the past we\u2019ve been as you know very, very asset sensitive. And we have been bringing that down over time. I think it's the view of the committee that we will continue to work that down. As you know, cash and securities aren't the only way to do that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that while we continued at a pretty good pace of adding securities in the fourth quarter, that's going to continue likely through the first quarter, but after that if the committee chose to we can continue to work down that asset sensitivity through interest rate swaps to the extent that the shape of the curve looks attractive on the balance sheet. I will say historically the other thing I should note is that historically we have published a fast and a slow asset sensitivity. I think moving forward as we get into 2017, we are probably going to be publishing one baseline number and then probably publishing some sensitivities around that. So rather than having kind of the guardrail of the fast and slow, we\u2019re going to provide more of a maybe a midpoint estimate for lack of a better term, and then provide sensitivities around that, which we think will be just as valuable or perhaps more valuable to investors.", "David Eads", "Okay, very helpful. And then, maybe looking into 1Q, you talked about the loan mix kind of resulting in a flat yield or average yield on loan, presumably we should see more of a benefit from the December hike in 1Q results and probably that would offset the mix shift there, but maybe the upside is less than what we saw from the hike from a year-ago? Is that all kind of reasonable in thinking about 1Q?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yes, I think so. It should be. I would expect it should be roughly comparable to what we saw last year. You are right about the mix shift and you are right about the timing. The rate increase income to the end of the year, we got a lot of things that kind of replace in the next month or quarter after that. So you\u2019re going to see that work in the first and second quarter. And it should be roughly consistent in terms of margin pick up. I believe to what we saw last year.", "James Richard Abbott", "Yes, the only thing, David. this is James. I'll just jump in. The last year we had a large headwind from the income from purchase credit impaired loans are the ones we bought from the FDIC in 2009 and that we still have some income from that, but it's pretty small compared to where it was in the fourth quarter of '15. So there is less headwind to work through there. So you might see it shine through a little bit more this time around.", "David Eads", "Hi, guys. Great color. Thanks", "James Richard Abbott", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Dave Rochester", "Hey, good afternoon, guys.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Hi.", "Dave Rochester", "Just back on the NIM discussion, it just seems like there are a lot of moving parts there for the NIM in the first quarter with a lot of support, you've got the cash going to securities, the decline in securities premium NIM, the rate hike, anyway you could frame what you expect the benefit will be overall for the NIM in 1Q and then just based on your assumptions you\u2019ve for the year I\u2019d imagine you are thinking NIM expands through 2017, but probably has the biggest move up in 1Q, is that fair?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Well, a couple of things. I can't be any more specific around kind of a point estimate for net margin in the first quarter. You correctly point out that there is a lot of countervailing influence is there. The repricing of the SBA bonds for example, much slower premium amortization on some of the fixed rate MBS. We've got -- while we are not seeing spread compression necessarily in the loan portfolio, we are seeing a continued change in the composition of loans, which have the effect of reducing the overall loan yield. That\u2019s kind of a headwind and as you point out a tailwind is the rate increase. We are also expecting -- my expectation is that we will be able to maintain deposit rates close to where they are at. That's going to be kind of a heavily competitive driven situation. But my expectation is at least for now we are going to be able to maintain that. So that your point there's a lot of things that obviously impact the net interest margin. On balance, I expected to be a little higher in the first quarter. As we move throughout the year it's hard to see with absolute clarity whether or not the gain that we are picking up from the rate increase this quarter is going to -- is going to be offset by those continued composition changes in the loan portfolio. But I would expect as we have seen over the course of last year, I'd expect that NIM to continue to be quite strong.", "Dave Rochester", "Then are you assuming any further curve steepening in your assumptions? I mean, you\u2019re talking about number rate hikes, but what are the steepening, I missed that part.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I\u2019m sorry, the question was about the impact of steepening?", "Dave Rochester", "Yes, it is in terms of your NII assumptions, your estimate for NII growth. Are you assuming any additional curve steepening to what we\u2019ve already seen? And then I know you\u2019ve said no more rate hikes, so I was just wondering about additional curve steepening [indiscernible]?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yes, sorry. Our balance sheet is very sensitive to the short end of the curve, so that would not necessarily change the outlook. Another point though that is worth mentioning, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the security purchases are not dependent upon cash available on the balance sheet. Obviously what that implies is to the extent we buy bonds beyond the cash that's available on the balance sheet, we are incrementally funding those. And so the marginal benefit, if you will, would be lower on those incremental purchases than what we've seen over the course of the last 18 months, because of that point you are no longer replacing cash with securities, but you are actually going out and funding those. So it's kind of yet another complexity as you think about net interest margin and the outlook there.", "Dave Rochester", "Yes, that makes sense. I guess, I was thinking about securities reinvestment rates going up over time and it seems like you're going to be having a lot more in the way of purchase activity there. I was just wondering where purchase rates are today overall? I know you're buying a lot of different types of securities, but \u2026", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yes, we are. Overall it's probably a little over 2 -- kind of between 2 and [indiscernible] is kind of where we are buying bonds today.", "Dave Rochester", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Okay. Thank you, Dave.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks, good afternoon. I was wondering just on the expense side, the increase for this year that was kind of expected, you talked about the technology plan continuing to move forward. I\u2019m just wondering if you could update us on the progress of the technology spending, specifically when do you expect that to peak and will that depending on your answer to peak, provide any tailwinds to future expense growth as we get out of '17? When does that start to come back to us in terms of that net efficiency improvement?", "Scott J. McLean", "Sure, Ken. This is Scott McLean. So our core transformation project and all the related projects that was laid -- that laid the groundwork for that fundamental technology project, we\u2019re well underway with all of that. We have basically disclose that the expense increase -- that's in our run rate right now, it was about $25 million in 2016. It will be in the low 30s this year. So there is only about a $6 million headwind, if you will, $6 million, $7 million, $8 million, in 2017. And this is a multiyear project. It's going to be going on for the next three, four, five years when you think about all elements of what we are doing. And as for how it will what the expenses will be in '18 and '19? They could be slightly higher than that 2017 level. But we really have not made a forecast or speculated about a forecast publicly in those years.", "Ken Usdin", "And as a follow up, you talked about what you have had as a partial offset to the spending. Is there anything else that you guys would contemplate on top of what you\u2019ve already done to help self fund that tech infrastructure expenditure, because I think at some point there is an expectation that that gets to be a net positive, and your point is that it might be a little further out, so \u2026.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Absolutely. ", "Ken Usdin", "So what else is going underneath the surface as far as that\u2019s concerned?", "Scott J. McLean", "Right, Ken. So the incremental expense impact that I described is sort of the gross expense impact, if you will. So there are cost savings that we are identifying all along the path, some of which has to do with the technology itself and the expense savings that will allow us to achieve and I would say 2018, '19, '20. But most of it really relates to the fact just a continual process evolution we have had towards adopting common practices across our Company. We believe that in the narrowest sense that allowed us to save about $11 million in 2016. We believe that number will go up by $6 million, $7 million this year. It will be $17 million, $18 million in cost savings from just adopting common practices. And by the time we get to 2018, 2019, we believe that savings run rate will be in the $30 million to $40 million range. So the run rate I was talking about was sort of gross expense impact on the P&L, all of which will be offset or large part will be offset over time by the savings that we\u2019re creating, so which is directly related to the technology other of which just had to do with the adoption of common practices.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, got it. Thank you for the color, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill. Your question please.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps", "Hey, good evening.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Hi, Brad.", "Paul E. Burdiss", "Hi, Brad.", "Scott J. McLean", "Hi, Brad.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps", "Hey, Scott, just wanted to follow-up maybe Texas for a moment. In the appendix you talk about the Houston CRE book polling in really well, it looks like it's as good or better in some cases in the rest of the CRE book, but just kind of curious if you could add any more color to that, there was a public REIT in Texas last week out with some pretty tough comments around at [indiscernible] rents at their Analyst Day, being down 35% or something kind of from the peak, but just curious any other color you can provide there. It looks like you guys are holding in quite well, but anything else you could add that would be much appreciated.", "Scott J. McLean", "Sure, Brad. Happy to do that. You can see the relative size of our CRE exposure in Texas which is on Slide 24. And as you will note, about 60% of it is in the Houston area, San Antonio, Austin, the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, other areas where we have exposure, those economies are doing just fine. We don\u2019t want a broad brush, but they really are doing just fine. The real issue is in Houston and it's important to note in the Houston portfolio that there is virtually no exposure to land, number one. Secondly, that the term exposure versus construction, it's about 70% term, 30% construction. And when you think about it, our office exposure which is headline news almost weekly across the country people want to write articles about the Houston office market, we have very limited exposure there, most of which is well into lease up. Generally speaking, projects less than a dozen by the way that are in the kind of 50% to 60% debt to cap. The multifamily area is clearly where the greatest weaknesses is. Industrial retail are doing just fine. Hospitality is showing some weakness, but really multifamily and our multifamily exposure is -- interestingly most of our multifamily projects that are in lease up are achieving within 5% to 10% of what our bank rate assumptions were. So, all in all, and what we are seeing from a deterioration standpoint, in the fourth quarter we saw a little bit of deterioration in the CRE portfolio, but not material. And we\u2019ve had virtually minimal nonperforming assets and no charge-offs at this point. So the underwriting has held up really quite well.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.", "Ken Zerbe", "Great, thanks. I guess going back to Paul's comments, you were talking about self funding the securities portfolio growth. Obviously this quarter had really strong total deposit growth, but how much of that is actually like a planned activity by management? Like we think about the securities growth, it's not dependent on cash, but are you changing how you gather deposits or the rate that you\u2019re paying on deposits in order to build the securities portfolio faster than you may have otherwise?", "Paul E. Burdiss", "Yes, this is Paul. Thanks for your question, Ken. I view deposits as critically important component to the value of the franchise. And so, regardless of what we\u2019re doing with securities, we're going to be designing products and pricing them competitively and trying to bring in as many client driven stable deposits as we can. I mean, there is a lot of value there both in terms of profitability, but also liquidity. So I would not say that there is a direct linkage. Obviously to the extent you have a lot of deposits and exceeds your ability to grow loans, which has been pretty rare, in ancient history, but not so rare recently, that can help to fund securities growth. But short answer to your question is they\u2019re not necessarily linked. The other thing I'd say, which I think we said in our prepared remarks is that a lot of the deposits that we saw in the fourth quarter were seasonal and so we\u2019d expect those to migrate away in the first quarter. I hope that answers your question.", "Scott J. McLean", "We haven't fundamentally changed our pricing or -- I mean you see the pricing is actually very -- totally stable between the two periods. It was actually down just a little bit on the savings and money market category. So anyway, they\u2019re really not connected that way.", "Ken Zerbe", "Got it. Okay. That helps. And then just a quick question, in terms of the provision, the guidance that '17 is essentially in line with 2016 provision expense, at what point is the reserve release, and then presumably a lot of it relates to the oil and gas portfolio, but at what point does the expected reserve release in the oil and gas portfolio slow to the point where you start to see an acceleration again, like how quickly does that run off?", "Scott J. McLean", "Ken, this is Scott. The reserve even though the percentage went up just a tick in the fourth quarter, the actual dollar amount in the reserve went down a bit. And so we saw some relief there. And I think we\u2019re being cautious about our outlook for the year. Clearly everything we're seeing is in the fourth quarter was pretty favorable happy to talk about that, but I believe that on the side for right now. And so, I think our basic assumption is if we continue to see the kind of improvement we saw in the fourth quarter, then you can certainly make a case that you wouldn't be reserving for charge-offs as they occur, and you can see that that reserve is about $200 million. So there is quite a bit that can come down there. You just have to pick what percentage do you think you would want to keep against the portfolio long-term and there is quite a distance between where we are in that percentage.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I think implicit of what we\u2019re saying is kind of a rotation from out of the energy reserve into just probably something that looks a little more normal than the rest of the portfolio. By more normal, as we point out, I mean, $1 million net charge-offs on the $40 billion portfolio isn't what we think obviously sustainable much as I'd love to see it. So, its -- I expect -- I would expect over the next couple of years we\u2019re going to have pretty low charge-off ratios in the rest of that portfolio, but I don't expect them to be quite that low and so we\u2019re just kind of making in the possibility of some kind of normalization there.", "Ken Zerbe", "Great. Okay, thank you.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yup.", "James Richard Abbott", "Latif, this is James. We just have a few minutes left, if we can go into the mode where we do one question per questioner and happy to take more questions offline from those same people if they\u2019re interested in follow-ups. But we try to speed through the list here.", "Operator", "Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your question please.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Hello there. Thank you for taking the question. The weakness in C&I outside of oil and gas, you mentioned that it would be a bit disappointing in the quarter and that feels like it goes broader than Zions to other banks and industry data. What do you think is happening there? We hear lots of banks talk about their customers being more optimistic after the election, but so far it doesn\u2019t seem to have manifested itself in loan growth. So what do you think is behind that?", "Harris H. Simmons", "I mean, they just finished counting the vote. I guess, it takes a little bit \u2026", "Geoffrey Elliott", "But it feels like it's going the opposite way. It kind of feels almost like it slowdown if you look at some of the data.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I guess, what I\u2019m saying is that, you\u2019re not going to see the effects of anybody's optimism reflected I think that quickly. I\u2019m hoping you will see that play out during 2017. You know beyond that, we saw just -- I don\u2019t know, somewhat was just kind of idiosyncratic we saw some larger pay downs, we didn\u2019t see lot of larger deal originations late in the year as sometimes we would typically see and so I don\u2019t know, Michael do you have any of this? Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer is here.", "Michael P. Morris", "No, I will just add to what you\u2019ve said that in the fourth quarter the election wasn\u2019t determined, so that\u2019s when deal flow would have picked up. We had the kind of loan growth we expected in C&I, so now that the election is over, I think we\u2019re looking at the first quarter to see what that translates to potentially in the second quarter.", "Scott J. McLean", "If I could add one more thing, I will point to slide 29, where we kind of -- its in the appendix, it\u2019s a slide that we\u2019re providing on regular basis and it shows linked quarter growth kind of by our affiliate banks and by type. And you can see that obviously we\u2019ve a continuing headwind related to oil and gas and natural real estate C&D [ph] loans. And so we -- that was certainly a contributor to the fourth quarter.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Your question please.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Hi, everybody.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Hi.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Just a follow-up on the comments around C&I. One thing that stood out to me was your expectation for only moderate growth in C&I in 2017. I\u2019m surprised, you\u2019re not expecting a bit of an increase. I understand the drags you are talking about in this quarter and this year, but when you think about pipelines building, are you just been conservative or is there something going on that you\u2019re not expecting better commercial loan growth this year? Thanks.", "James Richard Abbott", "This is -- Steve, this is James here. One of the things that that we\u2019ve made some adjustments to is on the multifamily side which you\u2019re not asking about, but we also have made some modifications on the leverage lending side as well which is maybe one of the considerations.", "Scott J. McLean", "I would just add to that too, we -- again if you sort of bench back to June 1 of 2015, we called for mid single-digit growth in loans and we haven't really changed our opinion about that. Over the last 18 months we've had some consecutive quarters of softness, we\u2019re experiencing that now. In C&I I\u2019m talking about specifically and -- but year-over-year we have solid progress there, that bubble chart that we show in here, shows that we\u2019re growing year-over-year in the areas we want to, but we\u2019re going to have some soft quarters in there and we think we\u2019re in that kind of phase right now, but by the middle to the end of this year we think we\u2019re going to put up loan growth numbers consistent with what we did for last year.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I just --- I would just add, this is really important topic I think, something we talk a lot about. Number one, it's just -- its hard to forecast. Now let me start with that. We haven't -- if we were really good at forecasting interest rates, we\u2019ve not been very good at forecasting loan growth. And it's -- so I think there's a tendency to be cautious given the fact we\u2019ve had a couple of quarters of slow growth. On the other hand, there are some things we\u2019re doing, I mean, we\u2019re just completing a reengineering of the way we approve and fund business banking loans. So these are credits, kind of small business credits or particularly in the $500,000 up to about $3 million range, that is going to make it much faster, I think a much better experience for customers and for our own people. And I expect that\u2019s going to be in place by late second quarter. I actually think that's going to help a lot, we\u2019re adding more mortgage loan originators. There are things that we\u2019re doing that could speed this a little bit, but I think we\u2019re made cautious by the fact we had a few months of slow growth here. And hopefully, just to the prior question, attitudes about the economy etcetera, will play a positive role too in stepping up originations.", "Scott J. McLean", "I just want to emphasize again what I\u2019ve said earlier and Harris said earlier too, our whole plan is not built around 10% loan growth. Its built around mid single-digit loan growth and the other elements that you know that we\u2019ve talked about, so we\u2019re not happy with the level of loan growth in the fourth quarter, but nor we fearful about being able to put up the year this year similar to the 2016 full-year results.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Fair enough. Thanks for all the color, guys.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR. Your question please.", "Bob Ramsey", "Hey, good evening. Just want to be sure I heard you correctly, that the expected diluted share count is 210 million in the first quarter of '17? And if that\u2019s right, I know you can't perfectly predict stock price, would it be your expectation to buybacks are sufficient to bring that down through the course of the year?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Obviously you guys can't even perfectly predict stock price.", "Paul E. Burdiss", "This is Paul. What I said was that 210 million assumes the stock price is similar to what it is today and that also incorporates the expected buyback in the first quarter. So that is a net number.", "Bob Ramsey", "For the first quarter not full-year, but for the first quarter?", "Paul E. Burdiss", "For the first quarter, yes.", "Bob Ramsey", "Okay.", "Paul E. Burdiss", "And again we got an extra page in the appendix just so that you can choose your own path for a stock price and kind of assess from there, where you think diluted shares are going to be.", "Bob Ramsey", "Looking at that page, I mean, how much of dilution was there in the fourth quarter and what was, I guess, the average price in the fourth quarter?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Bob, it's about 1 million shares worth of dilution due to the warrants and then I might also add that there are some stock exercise, some of the employees exercise stock option, so that was a driver of the -- some additional shares.", "Bob Ramsey", "Okay.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I don\u2019t have [technical difficulty]. Average share price in the quarter was -- about 37. It was about a $1 over the weighted average price -- weighted average exercise price of the warrants.", "Bob Ramsey", "Okay. And have you all given any thought to, sort of as you think about CCAR next year, considering doing something about the warrants, as opposed to common share buybacks, or addressing them in some way?", "Harris H. Simmons", "That\u2019s really always part of our -- as we think about capital planning, we\u2019re thinking about all the capital instruments outstanding, preferred stock, and warrants and common stock, so that\u2019s really part of our thinking and then we just try to sort out where the best value for shareholders is as we think about returning capital.", "Bob Ramsey", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks for giving me a little extra minute here, to be able to get my question in.", "Harris H. Simmons", "You\u2019re welcome, Marty.", "Marty Mosby", "I was basically looking at the sentence where you said, future net additions to securities balance is not limited by cash. I\u2019m trying to take that, and look at your liquid assets on the balance sheet, which didn't change over the last quarter, even though you added so much in the securities, because deposits ran up.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yes.", "Marty Mosby", "And then now, what\u2019s happening is those deposits are going away, aren't we going to end up with a little bit of a pinch there? And Paul, is that why you were kind of already foreshadowing that future rate sensitivity would be adjusted through swaps more than the securities portfolio?", "Paul E. Burdiss", "Yes, I wouldn\u2019t call it a pinch, I would call it kind of a movement toward a normal kind of balance sheet net funding position. And as I said, I was -- I\u2019m anticipating that securities growth will continue through the first quarter, but we're going to ultimately get to a size of a securities portfolio that we\u2019re comfortable with to manage on balance sheet liquidity. And then from there on we\u2019re going to need to manage our interest rate sensitivity through other mechanisms such as interest rate swaps, that's really what I was trying to get at.", "Marty Mosby", "I got you. I just didn't know how much of that big run-up in deposits, which was a big number, it was almost funded the complete increase in securities, if that\u2019s going to all go away, then that starts to force you to start borrowing short-term, or begin to do some other things on the balance sheet. So just looking at it, you would be fairly effectively managing the deposits at that point, and then from there on you would use swaps like we talked about?", "Paul E. Burdiss", "Yes. Couple of things. One, you can look at deposits last year, fourth quarter to first quarter and you can see that what we saw on the fourth quarter and what we\u2019re expecting in the first quarter is kind of seasonal and we have seen it previously. The other thing I would out which, I know, you know Marty is that we really have zero incremental kind of wholesale borrowing. We are like a 100% deposit funded as an organization. And as a result, are in extremely strong sort of net funding position. So as I said, moving into the kind of a net borrowed position over time, and it's going to be probably relatively small, is completely normal in the context of our balance sheet.", "Marty Mosby", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your question please.", "Kevin Barker", "I just had a quick question on the securities balances, they\u2019ve obviously grown quite a bit this quarter and have grown to close to -- a little over 23% of interest earning assets. And you let on, that you may continue to increase that balance, which I'd assume would be from other funding. At what level do you expect or are you comfortable getting the securities as a percentage of interest earning assets?", "Paul E. Burdiss", "We haven't provided that level specifically, but I think I would point to the remarks that I\u2019ve made, which is we saw a decent amount of portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that kind of continues into the first quarter and then that\u2019s probably going to be as we think about size of the portfolio, there is probably not going to be a lot of incremental need to continue to increase that balance sheet liquidity after the first quarter.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Abbott for any closing remarks. Sir?", "James Richard Abbott", "Thank you everyone for your time today. We appreciate your attendance and your interest in Zions, and we look forward to speaking to you in the future at a conference or at the next quarter's earnings call.

Please go ahead.", "James Abbott", "Thank you, Abigail, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2016 first quarter earnings.", "Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release as well as a supplemental slide deck are available at ZionsBancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer section. We ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris Simmons", "Thank you very much, James, and we want to welcome all of you to our call this afternoon to discuss our first quarter results. I'm going to talk about some information on the accompanying slides, just some opening comments here.", "On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is a result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted net interest expense levels that are in line with our stated expense initiatives.", "Another item that appears to be an emerging trend in the last six months is stronger loan growth. In the first quarter, loans increased at an annualized rate of 7.6%, accelerating from the prior quarter's rate of 5.3%. It was one of the best first quarter growth rates Zions has posted in the last decade. We achieved positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter and we're tracking well on the efficiency initiative that we announced last summer, with the efficiency ratio falling to 68.5%.", "Although there will be much discussion about energy lending on this call, which only comprises about 6% of our loan portfolio, the other 94% of our loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well, and energy is a manageable situation for us. Of note, although the earnings per share only increased $0.01 per share over the prior year period, the change in the provision for credit losses between those two quarters is equal to about $0.12 per share. So, although energy concerns will be with us for 2016, that effect is fairly transitory compared to the improving trend in underlying financial performance over the course of the last year.", "If we turn to Slide 4, our pre-provision net revenue has improved by 21% over the past year. This positive operating leverage has been driven by holding adjusted non-interest expense growth of 2.5%, while adjusted revenue has increased nearly 8% over the same period. We expect to continue to post continued strong momentum in this area over the next couple of years.", "On Slide 5 we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the fourth quarter we experienced an acceleration in the first quarter with loans held for investment increasing, as previously noted, 7.6% annualized, after posting a healthy 5.3% annualized growth rate in the prior quarter. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth, specifically non-energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans.", "Deposits declined modestly, about 1%, from the prior quarter, which is somewhat common for a first quarter for us, and the year-over-year improvement of 3.7% is similar to the performance in first quarters over the, approximately, the last decade.", "Moving to Slide 6, we're well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio to 66% or better for the full year 2016. We're encouraged with the improvement from the prior quarter to 68.5% in the first quarter, which included a couple of significant seasonal expense items.", "Advancing to Slide 7, excluding energy loans, credit quality is really solid across the Company by various loan types and geographies. Total classified loans increased to 3.7% from 3.4% in the prior quarter, but aside from energy, classified loans declined slightly to 2% of total loans.", "Non-performing assets, expressed as a percentage of loans and OREO, increased to 1.3% from 0.9% in the prior quarter. However, if one excludes energy credits, the non-performing asset to loan ratio is only 0.7%.", "On the topic of losses, substantially all the losses in the first quarter were attributable to energy loans. We'll have some further discussion on that later. But the takeaway here is that the energy situation is quite manageable and the overall provision and loss rates remain in line with industry averages.", "On Slide 8, this is a repeat of a slide we produced for our Investor Day back in February, but it helps to visually show the various initiatives that we're tracking to help improve the operating performance of the Company. I'm pleased with the progress made in several of these areas in a relatively short period of time, and most initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and timelines.", "Similarly, Slide 9 has a summary of the key financial performance metrics that we are targeting and we feel very good about the progress we've made and expect that, with continued discipline, that we'll meet or exceed these goals.", "With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results.", "Paul Burdiss", "Thank you, Harris. I'll begin on Slide 10.", "For the first quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $79 million or $0.38 per share. Relative to the fourth quarter, net interest income increased about $4 million. Adjusted for fourth quarter recoveries of interest income and income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased $17 million or about 4% on a linked-quarter basis. Customer related fees, which is the bulk of non-interest income, were flat to the fourth quarter and improved about 7% from the first quarter of 2015.", "At just less than $400 million, non-interest expense was slightly lower in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter. However, there were several notable items impacting both quarters.", "First, on salaries and employee benefits. The first quarter included $6 million related to equity grants to retirement eligible employees and $7 million in seasonal payroll taxes, while the fourth quarter included an incentive compensation accrual reversal of $5 million. Additionally, as noted on the fourth quarter earnings call, fourth quarter non-interest expenses included elevated levels of FDIC loss-sharing expense and an elevated legal accrual. We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our costs of doing business, our collective efforts allow Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted non-interest expenses at less than $1.6 billion for 2016.", "Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses, as we conveyed at February's Investor Day, we increased our allowance for credit losses in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, reflective of continued stress in our oil and gas portfolio. As we progressed through 2016, we currently expect quarterly provisions to be roughly consistent with first quarter results. A key driver of this outlook is overall market conditions, including the level of volatility of energy prices. Scott will provide more detail on our energy portfolio in just a moment.", "Slide 11 outlines our recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was about 8.5% -- was up about 8.5% when compared to the first quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was up at an annualized rate of just under 4%. When controlling [ph] for the $13 million of elevated FDIC related revenues and interest income recoveries reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. The linked-quarter growth rate is closer to 15%.", "This recent rate of growth in net interest income, while not sustainable over the long term, reflects our focus on improving the profitability of our balance sheet and has been significantly helped by strong loan growth, the movement of cash, the high-quality liquid investments, the maturities of higher-cost wholesale funds, and December's federal funds target rate increase.", "Looking ahead, net interest income is expected to increase throughout 2016 as loan growth and active management of the investment portfolio impact the size and mix of earning assets. Importantly, our performance objectives assumed a 25-basis-point increase in the federal funds target rate in December of 2016. We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates as shown in the box at the bottom right of Slide 11.", "Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the first quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent, high-quality, liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rules.", "Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in baseline and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the first quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $1.3 billion on average when compared to the fourth quarter. This average balanced growth was influenced by the $1.1 billion point-to-point increase in available-for-sale securities, as well as the continued impact of purchases we made in the prior quarter.", "We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet sensitivity, interest rate sensitivity, as we purchased fixed-rate investments, and with respect to duration extension risk inherent in the investment [ph] portfolio. The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over three years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is about 2.6 years today. And if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 3.1 years.", "On Page 13 we break down year-over-year loan growth in a slightly different format than we have utilized previously. The size of the bubbles on this chart represents loan portfolio size, while the position against the vertical axis represents year-over-year growth. As shown, Zions is generally growing where we want to grow, while owner-occupied C&I and residential mortgage remain opportunities for additional growth. Compared to the prior quarter, period-end loans grew 7% on an annualized basis, with particular strength in C&I and term CRE. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth while maintaining our underwriting standards.", "There are four loan classes that have been in decline this past year or more, and the most substantial rate of decline are in the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio, each declining approximately 16% from the prior year-ago period.", "The national real estate portfolio represents about 5% of loans and the attrition here has resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point of the overall growth of a loan portfolio during the past year. We have indicated that we expected the rate of attrition to taper, and that is beginning to happen, recently declining an annualized $276 million as compared to the year-over-year decline of $215 million.", "On energy, as we move through the spring redetermination on upstream energy products [ph], we expect pay-downs due to reduced borrowing basis.", "To summarize, our outlook for loan growth for the next 12 months is for an increasing portfolio, which should be in the mid-single-digit rate of growth range.", "Another key component of net interest income, which is the rate or yields of the portfolio and loan production, can be found on Slide 14. The slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 10 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.14%. As described in the press release, the prior-quarter container recovery of interest income of about $8 million included in the fourth quarter loan yield, as well as elevated income from FDIC supported loans. Excluding these two factors, the yield on the loan portfolio increased somewhat from the prior quarter, lifted by the increase in benchmark rates. However, older loans that were booked at wider spreads are regularly maturing and continued to place slight pressure on loan yields.", "The securities portfolio improved slightly this quarter, largely due to the changing composition of the portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk, as well as the increased rates that affected our floating rate securities. At the bottom of the chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percentage of earning assets, which continues to be quite low and was stable relative to the prior quarter.", "The net interest margin increased to 3.35% in the first quarter, a 12-basis-point increase from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the ongoing shift in earning asset composition to a higher concentration of loans and securities and a lower concentration of cash.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss our fee income initiative, as well as provide additional detail about our energy portfolio. Scott?", "Scott McLean", "Thank you, Paul. On Slide 15 we're pleased to report the continued strength in fee income growth. Because of the seasonality of the results, we think the year-over-year comparison is more relevant. Through the hard work of our employees, we were able to increase customer-related fee income by 7% over the year-ago period. These results have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of the expense associated with rewards programs such as cash-back from the non-interest expense category to net against our card revenue, which was done to align our accounting approach to be more comparable to the majority of banks within the industry.", "The areas experiencing the most significant growth in fee -- in customer fees included loan fees, which increased nearly $4 million or 38% from the year-ago period, to equal [ph] $14 million in the first quarter of 2016. Bank card fees increased more than $2 million or 17% to equal nearly $18 million. Treasury management is our largest category of customer related fee income, which increased 3% from the year-ago period to equal about $35 million. Relative to the prior quarter, we experienced an increase in dividends, although there was a valuation adjustment to one of our investments that adversely affected dividends by about $2 million.", "Transitioning to energy now, obviously is of significant concern to many investors and it's an all-hands-on-deck effort here at Zions to do as much as possible obviously to protect the value of both the principal and the interest of our loans at the same time demonstrating our long-term commitment to our customers.", "Before we dive in to the numbers though, let me first address something that is the subject of much discussion on the earnings conference calls of other banks with energy exposure, the Shared National Credit Exam results. As you know, this is a regulatory exam and is subject to disclosure restrictions. We have incorporated the vast majority of the results of the Shared National Credit Exam in our first quarter results. And we've incorporated all of the results, the financial results of the quarter would not be materially different.", "Our grading methodology has been and continues to be consistent with regulatory guidance. As you may know, the Shared National Credit Exam is not final. Some grades of loans where we are a participant bank are in their appeal period. Obviously we downgrade credits based upon the Shared National Credit results where applicable. But if the Shared National Credit results are better than our internal grade, we leave the internal grade in place. So, as investors looking at our financial condition, you're getting a very conservative view of the portfolio.", "Let me move now to Slide 16. As you can see, our energy loan outstandings, and also from the material in the press release, increased $21 million from the prior quarter, with declines in the services portfolio, offset by some new underwriting and upstream, midstream and downstream, and a handful of defensive draws. Of course, energy loan commitments and balances are down substantially from a year-ago period and we do expect further attrition as we move through the borrowing base redetermination process. We're about 40% through the spring re-determination and we anticipate the average borrowing base of a client to decline by about 12% to 15% relative to the fall redetermination.", "Also on Slide 16, as you can see on the right side of the slide and the chart on Page 4 of the press release, classified energy loan balances increased by $194 million from the prior quarter to equal 27% of outstanding balances, and non-accrual loans increased by $220 million from the prior quarter to equal 10.8% of loan balances. The increase in both categories was evenly weighted between upstream loans and services: loans to energy services companies. The primary driver of these increases had to do with the severity of the commodity price volatility early in the quarter, a flattening of the NYMEX strip, and a continued uncertain outlook.", "Turning to Slide 17, we are displaying some new information here to help investors better understand the nature of our unfunded oil and gas commitments. We have just under $400 million of unfunded loan commitments in the criticize category or just under 20% of total commitments. However, and this is very important, about one-half of that $400 million is unavailable to the borrower for various reasons, including borrowing-based restrictions, covenant breaches, or anti-hoarding provisions. During the quarter we experienced six loans that did draw up on their lines, equaling about $55 million of balances, again not something we're happy to see but it is manageable, and as a senior secured lender, we feel good about our loss severity in the event that there is a default on any of these loans.", "Moving on to Slide 18, it may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of our criticized and classified energy loans, and even non-accrual loans, are still current on their payments. Only 9% of non-accrual loans are past due.", "Moving to Slide 19, as we all know, in the first quarter there was significant oil and gas price volatility. This volatility, combined with continuing rigorous credit-by-credit review and our top-down regression models, is leaving us to update our outlook for energy loan losses. More specifically, if oil were to hover in the mid-30s area, we currently expect losses in 2016 to be in the $100 million area. Recall, our prior outlook was for a range of $75 million to $100 million for the year. Clearly, prices today are above the mid-$30 range level. However, we always want to be prepared for lower prices. During the second quarter we will be closely monitoring the results of the spring reserve-based redetermination and the actions being taken by our private equity sponsors to better inform our full-year energy loss outlook.", "We continue to build our energy loss reserve to a level of $214 million, or more than 8% of energy balances. This is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations.", "I'm sure we'll have questions about energy lending, but let me step back and look at the objectives we're working towards as a Company. On Slide 20, this is a summary of several items we articulated at our recent Investor Day. We are fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage. And I think at this point, with more than 20% year-over-year growth and PPNR [ph], we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit, customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back-office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market, and many additional advantages.", "Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what we -- than what can be seen today. And we are tracking well against these goals as discussed earlier. Regarding returns of capital, it is premature to discuss capital returns opportunities as we are awaiting the results of the 2016 CCAR. However, we aspire to have a much higher return of capital than experienced in the recent past.", "Finally, we're absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgement that our commitment to doing business locally really is a strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank in the United States. And we are only one of four banks that have performed at industry-leading levels since the initiation of this survey.", "Paul, with that, I'll turn the call back over to you to conclude.", "Paul Burdiss", "Thanks, Scott. Slide 22 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are adjusting our loan outlook to increasing, due primarily to factors already discussed in earlier comments.", "We expect net interest income to increase from the first quarter level as continued growth of loans and investment securities offset possible pressure on loan pricing. Our outlook does not include the effect of the any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect to benefit to an annual net interest income of about $75 million to $135 million for each 100-basis-point increase in rates. That's particularly focused on the short end of the curve.", "We expect a quarterly provision for loan lease losses in 2016 that is roughly consistent with the provision taken in the first quarter of 2016, assuming current market conditions. This incorporates the maintenance of a strong reserve ratio on energy loans, although we expect energy loan balances to continue the declining trend.", "We expect that non-interest income, excluding dividends and securities gains and losses will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. As stated previously, we have committed to holding non-interest expenses to less than $1.6 billion for 2016 excluding severance and restructuring expenses.", "The effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than the normal quarterly run rate, which was facilitated in part from the consolidation of our banking charters. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% for the full year of 2016.", "We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. As noted last quarter, the preferred tender completed in the fourth quarter will reduced preferred dividends by approximately $10 million in 2016 versus 2015. I expect that you have noticed the preferred tender announced today along with this earnings release. This action if successful is expected to reduce our run rate preferred dividends to an annual level of roughly $45 million.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Abigail, would you please open the line for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]", "Our first question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you. First question I had. Just in terms of the provision expense. Totally understand that your guidance is for stable the first quarter. First quarter is probably a little bit higher than what I think some people may have been expecting. But help us understand why the provision expense should stay higher given oil has made a pretty sharp improvement from $30 to, call it, the low $40 range. It seems that things should be getting better for your energy portfolio, not necessarily worse.", "Scott McLean", "Ken, this is Scott. Thank you for the question. You know, if you look back at the price of oil and gas that, as we entered the quarter and then even throughout February, it's a very dynamic process, and it's just been in the last 30 days, including the first part of this quarter, that we've seen this rally. And so we're grading loans dynamically, we're evaluating the reserve dynamically. And we just -- it was such a punitive first quarter when you -- from an oil and gas price volatility standpoint, particularly the price of natural gas. The decline there was a fairly new event. And we just felt like the most important thing we could do would be to prepare for those first quarter oil and gas market conditions to continue.", "As it's turned out, they've not. The last 30 days we've seen a really nice rebound in oil and natural gas prices.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Understood, but I guess phrased a different way, if oil stays at $42, you still feel very -- and you know that for a fact, would you still guide for a provision expense equal to first quarter?", "Harris Simmons", "I think -- Ken, this is Harris. I think I'd just say that we're trying to be conservative and, listen, we know that this isn't going to be smooth through the quarters. We've tried to be helpful and giving a little bit of additional guidance in terms of what we think the losses in the portfolio are going to be, so I think that, you know, I think we're still comfortable with their kind of $100 million range this year. And could it come in better than the first quarter? Sure. That is going to, you know, I think bounce the other way too. But that's just kind of our best thinking in terms of where we think losses are going to be and trying to be conservative in terms of what we think could be out there in terms of continued pressure on the reserve if prices remained volatile and things don't continue to heal.", "Scott McLean", "I would also say, in a market like this, you really, you know, we have visibility maybe three to five months out, but we don't have clear visibility all the way to the end of the year, even if prices were to stay at $40. And so I just -- that's why we're going to err on the side of being conservative.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, understood. And just in terms of loan growth, I think it sounded like your guidance was a little bit stronger than what it was last quarter. Does that reflect an improvement in your expectations for future quarters or does your new loan growth guidance just simply reflects the stronger you had in the first quarter?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, I think, you know, and this quite ties into the -- your first question with respect to provisions, I mean, the kind of loan growth we're going to, you know, that we've been experiencing also was -- is going to be a factor in thinking about provisions, so it's not just energy. But it's -- loan growth for us has been a little bit of a fickle kind of a thing the last several quarters. What we can tell you is that we have seen quite a lot of consistency over the last six months and so far what we're seeing into the second quarter is encouraging. But it's hard to extrapolate that out very far.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR. Your line is open.", "Tim Hayes - FBR Capital Markets", "Hey guys. It's Tim Hayes for Paul Miller.", "Are you seeing any second derivative [ph] from energy? Is this -- is it flowing through to CRE or any other industries and any of your geographies?", "Harris Simmons", "We'll have Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer, speak to that.", "Michael Morris", "So we're tracking both CRE and consumer very closely. We initiated the same kind of heightened supervision and loan level ground-up analysis of the CRE and the consumer portfolios, and we aren't seeing large noticeable shifts or negative migration patterns. We are especially watchful of our multi-family portfolio in Houston, and we are seeing some rent concessions for longer-term leases. And so that has somewhat of an effect on net effective rents and NOI. But most of our properties are absorbing quite nicely, and office, there is some risk there, but the loan sizes are not significant and the underwriting is very solid with 50% to 55% loan to cost on some of the construction loans where they were done on a little bit of a speculative basis. And we have great sponsors there. And so we have quite a bit of comfort.", "If we see migration in the CRE book, it will mostly be in the past grade ranges, with maybe a few outliers that go to [inaudible].", "Scott McLean", "I would just add to that, Michael mentioned our office exposure in Houston, but the two -- the only two-spec office buildings we had totaled $36 million. One of them now is experiencing leasing and the other actually was put to bed with the long-term amortization as well. So we don't believe our office exposure is going to be material, although we do have exposure there.", "I would just comment also that you really have to look at our CRE exposure in Texas relative to what we had in 2008. We have about $1 billion less in total CRE exposure today than we had in 2008. We have significantly pivoted from construction lending to CRE term there, and you can see that in our numbers. We have virtually no Land A and B [ph] and we had close to a billion dollars of it going into the '08 downturn that was principally because, when you did construction loans, then you generally finance phase two and phase three land.", "And then the final point is that we -- the amount of equity that has gone in to office, multi-family, particularly, is almost double what it was in the cycle leading up to 2008. So, a lot of factors that are very different today than the last cycle we went through.", "Michael Morris", "And Scott, I would only add that, with respect to the consumer portfolio knock on risks there, I would point to Slide 26, which is this surveillance that we have on high oil and gas employment counties and we monitor FICOs, we refresh FICOs every two months, and we haven't seen any negative migration or blips in either FICOs or delinquency rates in consumable.", "Tim Hayes - FBR Capital Markets", "Great. Thanks for the color. And one more question for me. On margin. Just assuming that rates were to stay where they are today for the remainder of the year, how much more room is there to run with just converting lower-yielding assets to loans? And will this support NIM expansion for the rest of the year?", "Paul Burdiss", "This is Paul. Thank you for your question. I expect, you know, while we continue to fight loan pricing, I expect that the opportunity to redeploy cash into investment securities and loans will, at a minimum hold the net interest margin stable and perhaps could allow some modest expansion.", "Tim Hayes - FBR Capital Markets", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "Hey, good afternoon.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hello.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "Hey, Paul, just to follow up on the last question, in terms of maybe the amount of remixing that you think you [inaudible] to do, just kind of curious, the overall size of the balance sheet, going forward, will we start to see that grow or do you think it kind of stays stable and you continue to remix?", "Paul Burdiss", "I'd say our current plan is for a relatively stable size of the balance sheet, although I'll say by the time we get to the end of the year it's conceivable that the balance sheet could start to modestly grow. As you know, we've provided outlooks previously on the amount of growth that we expect in the investment portfolio throughout the year, which is kind of roughly probably, from here on out, kind of between $750 million and a billion dollars a quarter. So, depending on deposit growth and depending on our cash position, you could see us either adjust that or adjust the size of the balance sheet moving forward.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay, great. And then just one quick follow-up on energy. Just curious if you guys could maybe give us a breakdown of the $100 million or so of expected losses. How would that break down between sort of E&P and service?", "Scott McLean", "Sure. It's probably going to be 70% -- 60%, 70%, oilfield service and the remainder reserve-based.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "Great. That's all. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Participant", "Hey guys. This is Josh in for Ken. You saw a nice jump in securities yield this quarter, and can you just speak to roll-off versus new money yields and whether you -- whether there are any one-time helpers this quarter you note?", "Paul Burdiss", "I would note, the biggest -- one of the biggest one-time helpers this quarter is that about 25% of that available-for-sale portfolio is floating rate [inaudible] so we saw a benefit this quarter related to that. As far as the rest, you know, we continue to try to be measured as we think about the, as noted in my comments, the types of bonds we're putting out and the yields with those bonds. So, clearly, the shape of the curve, looking ahead, the shape of the curve will clearly affect the yield of those bonds coming on.", "Unidentified Participant", "Okay. And then just shifting gears, could you speak to how much more opportunity there could be in tendering for additional preferred in debt?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, the tendering question is difficult because, as you know, kind of the more you go after these bonds, the more difficult, they become hard to find. So in our capital plan, in 2015, we had a $3 million tender for preferred, which the announcement today kind of rounds that out for that $300 million, and there's a capital issue and subject to CCAR, I'm really not at liberty to discuss incremental plans with respect to preferred redemptions.", "Unidentified Participant", "Great. Thanks for the color guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.", "John Pancari - Evercore", "Good afternoon guys.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi, John.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore", "But to the $100 million loss expectation, could you just give me a little bit more detail on how you got that or why the change. I'm not sure I really get it. You were previously at 75 to 100 if oil remained at $30. What specifically made you bring that higher with oil here at 40 bucks?", "Scott McLean", "Right. This is similar to Ken's question I think in the sense that we, you know, that estimate really is based on our concern about the volatility of the price of oil in January and February and the decline in the price of natural gas. So -- and you may think, well, gee, that was the end of February and now we're in April, but we just -- we don't really pivot that fast and we, you know, that was pretty troubling what we saw in January and February and it could return. We've seen $40 before. We saw it coming down. And so now we're seeing it going up. But we could be back at $30 again. So we're just -- prefer to err on a more conservative side.", "I would also say on the -- as it relates to oilfield service, the longer this goes, which it's going to go, you know, even if prices improve, there is general understanding in the industry that the oilfield companies will not come back as quickly as the E&P companies do, there are a lot of reasons for that, and so we feel pretty confident that oilfield service will be under considerable stress for the remainder of this year and a fair amount of next year.", "John Pancari - Evercore", "Okay. All right, thanks.", "Scott McLean", "\u2026where reserve-based E&P companies may see nice rebound in the second half of the year, we don't think that's going to translate through to oilfield service nearly as quickly.", "John Pancari - Evercore", "Right. Okay. All right. And then separately, on the margin, just wanted to get a little bit of additional color on how much the Fed hike actually benefited your loan yields. You know, if you adjust for the FDIC loan impact as well as the loan recoveries that you have had previously in fourth quarter and you adjust for that, by my math, I guess loan yields were up about 3 basis points, is that all that you would expect from the Fed to help your loan yields or is there more coming?", "Harris Simmons", "Yeah. You know, that -- as you know, predicting the net interest margin could be really difficult. There are a lot of countervailing things here. Obviously the Federal Reserve rate increase helped us. But as you remember and as we disclosed on our Investor Day, we provided some incremental disclosures around kind of the sensitivity of earning assets to changes in rate.", "And one of the things I would point out is that we continue to have some level of loans, particularly prime-based loans, that are floored, and so they, for example, because they are at floor rate, would not have enjoyed the kind of the dollar-for-dollar, basis-point-for-basis-point increase with the Fed. And so that, you know, and we've also got some swaps on the book.", "So those things combined with I would say continued pricing pressure kind of led to that overall net yield improvement.", "John Pancari - Evercore", "Okay. All right, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. Your line is open.", "David Long - Raymond James", "Good afternoon guys.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hey.", "David Long - Raymond James", "Hey, Paul, can you just confirm, in your 12-month outlook, did you say that assumes no change in short-term rates?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah, I did. We've got in our performance objectives, as we look into 2017, you may recall that we've got an assumption that the target rate for the Fed Funds would increase in December of 2016. But as a practical matter, we're looking ahead for 2016, we do not have another rate increase in there.", "David Long - Raymond James", "Okay. And then my second question, regarding the loan recoveries, you said it was $13 million or so in the fourth quarter. Does that mean you didn't have any of that in the first quarter? And how do you expect that to move through the rest of this year?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah, it was interest recoveries, and there were a couple of items. One was income associated with our FDIC assisted loans and also interest income recoveries from loan recoveries. And those totaled $13 million, different kind of quarter to quarter.", "As it looks -- as it relates to the remainder of the year, that's not the kind of thing that I would expect to see. And so our outlook would not include any of that.", "David Long - Raymond James", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "Hi there, it's Geoff Elliott from Autonomous Research. Thank you for taking the question.", "Just a quick numbers type question, could you break out the provision between energy and non-energy, just for the quarter? Because I'm kind of confused looking at the increase in reserves from 5% to 8% on a $2.6 billion balance of energy loans plus the $36 million of energy-related charge-offs? I'd have thought with that quantum of increase in reserves, the provision would have been higher. So I'm guess there must have been a release elsewhere.", "James Abbott", "Geoff, I'll -- this is James Abbott, I'll just give you a quick thought, is that we -- one of the things -- one of the things that we did take a look at is our reserve for unfunded lending commitment, so let me start with that, and we made some fine-tuning adjustments based on the way we compute the reserve on that, particularly for smaller business customers that are less than $750,000 in size. So that was part of that allowance for credit losses in the overall portfolio balance.", "And then we -- the reserve for loans, excluding the energy loan portfolio, which is $2.6 billion. But excluding that, we'd have a reserve to loan ratio of about 1.2% on that book of business. And that would compare to no net charge-offs in the quarter on that portfolio and would also compare to about 70 basis points of non-accrual loans. So it's really pretty strong reserve relative to the current credit quality positioning at that and it's just continued to get better and better, so there's not as much support as there was two or three years ago for keeping that reserve level higher.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "And then just to follow up, in the release you used the world stellar to describe the non-energy credit, which is pretty forceful language, so, can you talk about what's so stellar about it?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, that we're seeing essentially no charge-offs, not just this quarter, but I mean we're seeing kind of a pattern of that. We're seeing delinquency rates. Almost any major of that, remainder of the portfolio, is looking about as strong as we've seen it right now, about as strong as we've seen it for a very long time.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Eads with UBS. Your line is open.", "David Eads - UBS", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Looking at Slide 27 where you give loan growth kind of in great detail, the growth in energy was really, really strong, and just curious if you could give a little color on kind of what the outlook there is in Texas, and then maybe if you have detail on how should the growth came in Houston versus the other parts of the state.", "Scott McLean", "Yeah. This is Scott. There was one large credit that was done there, it was a corporate credit, had nothing to do with energy, had nothing to do really with Texas economy. And it's a large 20-year client of the bank that we were able to move a transaction out of one of the global banks, they were at the end of a syndications process and the loan will pay down pretty quickly actually, will have about half of it amortized by the end of this year, if I remember correctly.", "They are seeing moderate growth in middle market and one to four-family mortgages, so, middle market commercial lending and one to four-family mortgages, and a portion of this real estate portfolio funded just basically related to construction -- the construction portfolio.", "David Eads - UBS", "All right -- yeah, go ahead.", "Scott McLean", "And in terms of the outlook, they're -- having gone through these declines before down there, they are -- their risk filters are very well-tuned and have been quite frankly for about two years, but there's a lot of good market share movement that will go on during a period like this. It happens in most other periods like this. And so there will be opportunity.", "There will also be energy underwriting that'll take place, as the stressed assets are purchased by new acquirers and as companies are put together, merged, so there will be new energy underwriting that probably will begin to manifest itself in the second half of the year.", "David Eads - UBS", "Maybe just to follow up on that, can you just kind of talk about, if that happens, what your appetite would be for taking on new energy loans right at this part of the cycle?", "Scott McLean", "Well, I would say that our appetite would be, you know, totally based on the normal credit underwriting criteria with again our full risk filters on. But if you were going to underwrite a reserve-based oil and gas transaction, today would be a moderately good time to do that. And so there will be good transactions that have presented themselves and will present themselves.", "On the oilfield service side, I would say the odds of that happening are much lower. We certainly will not ascribe much value to borrowing, you know, the borrowing basis, etcetera, etcetera, and the equity levels would be very high. The kind of financing we do there would probably generally be receivable-based more than anything else. But the new underwritings in energy will be more reserve-based and midstream than anything else.", "David Eads - UBS", "Right. Thanks for taking the question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining-Sparks. Your line is open.", "Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks", "Thank you. I want to ask a little bit about expenses just to change the subject a little bit. Personnel expenses were about 60% of the composition and year over year it grew about 6%. About half of that was related to I think moving those retirement-based awards up one quarter, so we're still seeing about 3% growth. Do we think that, as we move forward, we should be able to see some of the initiatives kick in and maybe that growth rate begin to slow down a little bit?", "Harris Simmons", "Listen, I think you're going to see it pretty flat and perhaps down a little bit. I mean you do have underlying these initiatives, I mean we were clear I think at the outset that those targets are growth targets, not net. And so you have normal kind of merit increases in compensation. We have a little higher incentive compensation accrual here in the first quarter than I think we had a year ago. And all of that's subject to kind of continued performance through the year. So that could be still variable and will be.", "And I would also note that, I mean, there are some job categories where the -- where wage pressures particularly in IT kind of related areas, I mean there are a few kind of specialized areas where the pressures are very real. So our hope would be to keep those flat to down, I think consistent with -- at the end of the day, we're really keeping an eye on the $1.6 billion and the efficiency ratio number, and that's what I'm most comfortable affirming that I think we're on a pretty strong track to accomplish those goals.", "Paul Burdiss", "This is Paul. If I could reinforce Harris's comments. We are very focused on the $1.6 billion maximum on non-interest expense. We're very focused on positive operating leverage. We're very focused on achieving our efficiency ratio objectives. So that's -- our focus is on the aggregate. And as Harris said, we've got levers in several of those line items and our expectation is that we'll achieve our target.", "Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks", "The second question I was going to ask is another subject, I'm not asking about the level of capital deployment, but just the approach, back when we were at Investor Day, the stock price, you know, of the industry was very depressed, so you had a big discount to your tangible book value. That pretty much had been eliminated. So as you sit there, if you look at dividends and share repurchase, does the change in stock price level change your objectives in the sense of what you would ask for distributed between dividends and share repurchase?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Go ahead, Harris.", "Harris Simmons", "Well, I'm not sure that it would today. But I mean, it's something, you know, we'll think about certainly hard before we -- before we pull any trigger.", "You know, it's really an exercise in thinking about the path we're on, relative valuation between our company and others in the marketplace, and trying to be careful that the -- and, you know, more to come I guess once we get CCAR results. But I think the major theme would be that we're really certainly very cognizant of the need to ramp up distributions, and then how we do it is going to be a function of what the market looks like, what we look like, etcetera at the time, so.", "James Abbott", "Thanks. Abigail, it's -- we got about five minutes to go and we have a few questions left in the queue, so we're going to go to the lightning round so we're just going to go one question and then we'll try to be concise in our answers and see if we can get through all of them before we close.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "I was just curious a little more about what has changed on the loan side, you are finally starting to see some good momentum and more consistency, especially like in a quarter that's seasonally soft. Is it the runoff slowing? Are your markets strengthening? Or is it just momentum building on itself? You know, what would you point to?", "Paul Burdiss", "This is Paul. I can start and ask my partners here to chime in.", "There are a couple of items. One is, if you go back six months ago, there was a lot of internal operational things that were kind of going on, and I've become convinced after speaking with those on the line that there was a little bit of a distraction. And now that we've got everybody fully engaged and actively out marketing, we're starting to see the benefit of that.", "I will say, anecdotally, although I haven't necessarily seen the evidence, but anecdotally, we believe that pay-downs, particularly in commercial real estate, are beginning to slow down or have slowed down in this quarter. And so that clearly would be also helpful.", "James Abbott", "We did -- Joe, this is James -- we did see origination volume in the quarter that was about 20% higher than it was in the year-ago quarter. And that I think supports Paul's comment that there were some distraction and it's really started to improve on that front. But also payoffs were slower.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Yup. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust", "Thank you. Good evening. Could you talk to us about the loan severities you've seen and the energy charge-offs you've experienced over the last three to six months?", "Scott McLean", "Sure, Jennifer. Yeah, this is Scott. Right. And you just mean sort of anecdotally?", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust", "Yes, correct.", "Scott McLean", "Yes, yes. So, generally speaking, on the reserve-based side, it's really kind of more of a marking to market, if you will. And on the oilfield service side, the losses there generally have related to private equity firm that may choose not to play forward and kind of forces a situation in the bankruptcy and liquidation. And I think that'll continue to be the trend. I think the losses on the oilfield service side will be lumpier and they will be because they just can't continue, and so that just accelerates the whole realization process, whereas on the reserve-based side, it's going to be kind of dribs and drabs here and there, and I don't think we'll have any real significant large pieces because we have no second lanes and we have no high-yield debt, and generally we had very conservatively underwritten senior pieces.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Micenko with SIG. Your line is open.", "Jack Micenko - SIG", "Hey, good afternoon. How much was the reward card expense re-class and how should we think about the other expense line item on a run rate. It dropped it at around 56 this quarter. How do we -- is that a good run rate now with that expense out, or how should we think about that?", "Paul Burdiss", "This is Paul. I'll start with your last question first. There's a lot of things that go into that, some of them being highly variable. I can't think of any items in particular that would change that number kind of quarter to quarter. So that's a decent approximation I think for run rate.", "As it relates to the bank card reclassification of the expenses, that is an annual number of about $20 million.", "Jack Micenko - SIG", "Twenty-eight?", "Paul Burdiss", "Two-zero, 20.", "Jack Micenko - SIG", "Two-zero. All right, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you. Your C&I loan yields went down by 10 basis points this quarter after increasing 15 basis points in the fourth quarter. You mentioned some older loans are putting pressure on that portfolio and some of them are based off of prime versus LIBOR. Could you help us understand like how many loans actually rolled off or matured in the first quarter to cause that big swing in asset yields despite the Fed increase?", "Harris Simmons", "Yeah, I think, and we tried to be as transparent about this as possible, the key -- one of the key drivers there of that increase in loan yields in the fourth quarter, which we disclosed then and we disclosed this quarter, were these interest recoveries on loan recoveries, and this elevated loss share [ph] income associated with the FDIC. That was about $13 million in the quarter, wherein, if you're going to do the math, as I think it was John correctly did, that's worth about 13 basis points on the loan yield in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next --", "Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray", "Go ahead, sorry.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Moran with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital", "Hey, thanks. I just wanted to revisit the defensive draws [ph]. I think you said there were five or six of them this quarter. Was that more out of the services or the upstream book? And then, what can you guys do to mitigate that or, kind of once it's there, how do you carry it?", "Scott McLean", "Well, first of all, the -- in terms of kind of the second part of your question, in terms of mitigating it, most banks are putting in anti-hoarding provisions and you don't have to wait for the maturity of a transaction to do that. It's generally almost everything in the energy space right now is being amended, renegotiated, etcetera, every six months or so. And so we're having pretty good luck at getting these anti-hoarding provisions in, number one.", "Secondly, generally speaking, when it's one of our strong private equity firms that's involved, the odds are much less likely that they'll try a defensive draw [ph]. So -- and that's been what we've experienced. And to answer the first part of your question, I mentioned there was about 50 million in defensive draws [ph], one of which is payback or will pay back shortly partially. And it's about 50%, by company it's about 50% upstream, 50% services.", "James Abbott", "Yeah. By dollar amount it's about $30 million in upstream and $20 million in services.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Services.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is open.", "Terry McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.", "Thanks. Just a quick question for Paul. When do you get to that $45 million run rate on the preferred stock dividends and can you just help us with the quarterly variability that we typically see?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes, I have a schedule here, if you could just hold on just a second. And just as a reminder, that $45 million, that's a 2017 figure. And I don't have that broken out all the way. I'll have to get back to you on the quarterly composition on that one. We'll have James follow up.", "James Abbott", "I was going to say, I'm happy to follow up. It's roughly $10 million on alternating quarters and $12 million on the other quarters. But I'll get back to you, Terry.", "Terry McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.", "Harris Simmons", "Well, we just want to thank you all for your interest and participation in the call and we look forward to talking to many of you then. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to James Abbott.", "James R. Abbott", "Thank you, Jamie, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our first quarter 2013 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your questions to 1 primary and 1 related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Thanks very much, James, and we want to welcome all of you to the call this afternoon. We are generally quite pleased with the first quarter results that you've all seen. Many of the trends were strong either on a relative basis such as loan growth on an absolute basis such as net charge-offs. Net charge-offs ratio this quarter, as we look around, looks like it's among the lowest in the industry.", "Additionally, we received, during the quarter, permission from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the majority of our numerous requests to improve our capital structure and cost. We've already announced the call of the Series B Trust preferred stock and we'll announce further actions imminently. We're hopeful that we'll be able to continue to improve our return on equity in 2013, as these actions are executed and they should reduce the cost of our capital and financing structure in material ways.", "Finally, last week, we announced an increase in our dividend to an annualized $0.16 per share from $0.04 per share. We've indicated to investors in the past that while our primary goal is to use capital generation to reduce high cost capital, we hope to modestly increase the dividend and so we've now begun that process.", "Let me touch upon a couple of fundamental highlights for the quarter. First, with respect to loan growth and net interest income, loan growth in the first quarter is typically a little weaker than in other quarters. We tried to be very transparent about what we were seeing as we went through the quarter, indicating that loans have declined by more than $100 million in early January. March was a strong month, pulling the company to a positive $148 million for the quarter as reported in our earnings release. I say strong, at least relative to what you're seeing from some other banks, I guess, these days. Our lenders report to us that they remain positive about loan growth prospects, pipelines generally remain pretty strong. Commercial customers seem to be generally more optimistic than they were 6 months ago and production volume was up 14% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to what we saw in the same quarter a year ago.", "However, as I noted in the press release, we saw further pricing pressure on loans. Beginning in February and continuing in March, some of the nation's largest banks cut prices on most loan types in most of our markets. Pricing had been fairly stable for most of 2012, at least on middle-market loans. But if this pricing pressure continues, it will likely result in roughly stable net interest income in 2013, despite our expectations for continued loan growth, which we had hoped would translate into positive growth and net interest income.", "Those of you who follow us closely know we think a lot about convexity. And while it's unclear when interest rates will rise, we are one of a very limited number of banks that are significantly asset-sensitive. Not only do we expect earnings to increase when rates rise, we expect to be able to avoid the significant haircut to equity that many banks may likely experience due to their heavy concentrations of mortgage-backed securities. As you know, we have virtually no exposure to that type of product.", "In the credit quality front, as I said, we continue to be pleased with credit loss performance. In the release, press release, we noted the continued improvement in gross charge-offs, although net charge-offs also declined because recoveries are volatile at this point in the cycle. We're watching gross charge-offs carefully. Our annualized net charge-off ratio was only 19 basis points during the quarter. We're very happy with that. Our nonperforming asset ratio expressed as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned declined at a continued strong rate and we expect to see further general improvement in that ratio in the quarters ahead.", "Finally, a note about capital, I'd highlight the fact that our Tier 1 Common capital ratio climbed above 10%, which was a nice milestone.", "And with that overview, I'm going to ask Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly financial performance in a little more detail. Doyle?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thank you, Harris. Good evening, everybody. Starting off with a brief overview, as noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $88.3 million or $0.48 per diluted common share for the quarter. That compares to $0.19 per share in the prior quarter. A couple of significant items are worth pointing out that tend to really move the needle on the EPS number from quarter-to-quarter. For the first quarter, the one we're reporting on today, the provision for credit losses was a negative $35 million, even though we are maintaining our conservative posture on reserving for credit losses. Even so, we reduced the provision or reduced the ALLL with the provision of minus $29 million, and the provision for unfunded lending commitments came down by $6 million. Together, the $35 million total, we've added about $0.12 per share to earnings compared to prior quarter's negative $9 million ACL, which would have been about $0.03 a share.", "Additionally, securities gains and losses for the quarter, including OTTI, netted to a loss of only about $4 million this quarter or $0.01 a share compared to the prior quarter's net loss of $74 million or $0.25 a share from securities-related charges. Combined, these 2 groups account for about $0.33 per share improvement compared to the prior quarter with a partial offset due to a decline in net interest income. The net interest income decline largely was attributable to a reduced day count in the first quarter compared to the fourth.", "Now turning to some of the individual drivers of the results. I'll begin with the revenue drivers. Average loans increased $413 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year, a bit over 1% quarter-over-quarter. We pay a bit more attention to average loans because of the variability with end-of-period loan balances and it's the number that actually drives earnings. But I note that end-of-period loan balances increased $148 million, including FDIC-supported loans and loans held for sale.", "We saw the usual rundown right after year end in loans but then it stabilized by the end of January, and then a lot of this loan growth came from late February till the end of the quarter. And as Harris noted, we've tried to keep you up-to-date as the quarter went on. I will note that the loan growth thus far has continued in the first 3 weeks of April up through last Friday.", "Let me draw your attention to the loan table on Page 10 of the release. Commercial and industrial loans do tend to have some seasonal trends and while they grew nearly 4% in the fourth quarter, the growth slowed in the first quarter to a rate of 2%. Note that the loan portfolio in the first quarter a year ago actually shrank at a rate of nearly 2%. So this was quite a favorable swing, with which we are pleased.", "The growth was predominantly in Texas, California, and to a modest degree, in Utah. Line utilization rates on revolving C&I do remain pretty weak. And in fact, they declined further to 31.8% compared to 33.1% at the end of the fourth quarter. As has been mentioned in some of the earnings calls by other banks, we've, as Harris noted, have seen some evidence of reemergence of pricing pressure this quarter. We noticed  this most particularly on larger loans. On the smaller loans, the pricing, while under a little bit pressure, is holding up better.", "Turning to construction and development loans, these increased by about $100 million or 5% sequentially. As we discussed previously, both in IR meetings and in previous quarterly calls, new construction commitments have been fairly strong for several quarters, as we increased our exposure to commercial construction projects when pricing terms and covenants have been some of the best our bankers have seen in their careers. These loans are now beginning to get into the funding stage after the equity has gone into the project. Because there's still a large significant amount of outstanding unfunded commitments in this category, we expect outstanding balances to continue to grow in 2013. However, because of concentration limits that we've adopted as part of our portfolio risk management, we are being disciplined about the new loans we make. And in fact, our commitments declined in the first quarter, after 5 consecutive quarters of expansion. And this pullback also coincides with the general softening in pricing terms and covenants as we observed some others getting more aggressive.", "Term CRE declined at 5 of our banks during the quarter, leading to the decline in the overall balance of just over $50 million. This was primarily driven by elevated prepayments, new production volume remains healthy and was one of the few types to see an increase in production compared to the fourth quarter.", "After several strong quarters, consumer lending declined slightly due partly to seasonal factors in home equity and credit cards but we do expect to see further growth in the year from this category broadly defined.", "Residential mortgage, mortgages increased by $60 million or 1.3%, and that's a better first quarter performance than the year-ago period which declined by 1.1%.", "If you want to turn to Page 14, now we'll discuss the margin and net interest income. The NIM declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter. One of the smaller declines we've had lately. The securities yields declined in part due to fewer dollars of -- we'll call them catch-up payments on CDOs. In other words, when banks that are behind on interest payments come current, there's a bump in yield during that quarter. We do expect such catch-up payments to continue as we still have exposure to just over 180 banks that are still deferring. Parenthetically, that's down from about 270 at the peak. Of the remaining 180 odd, there are about 2/3 of those who are well-capitalized and profitable. So we expect more deferring banks, not all of them certainly, but more of them to continue to come current over future quarters. But the quarterly rate is likely to vary and be somewhat unpredictable. Therefore, there will be a little bit of volatility associated with the securities yield for the next number of quarters.", "Additional pressure on securities yield can be ascribed to accelerated premium amortization on certain SBA loans. Combined, these changes have an impact of about 50 basis points to the portfolio. The decline in such yields looks fairly significant but because the securities are such a small percentage of the overall earning asset base, the decline pressured the NIM by only about 3 basis points.", "Other factors impacting the NIM included an increase in income from FDIC-covered loans due to faster prepayments than previously modeled, and a decline in cash-earning assets.", "Net interest income declined by about $12 million sequentially, although 3/4 of that decline is attributable to the usual seasonality, that is the reduced day count in the first quarter. Second quarter net interest income will be positively impacted by 1 extra day of interest, plus about $4 million less interest from the Series B Trust-preferred shares that we have announced. It's being called as of May 3. We also, as I've mentioned, anticipate some continued loan growth this quarter, although the effects of that will be somewhat offset by pricing pressure.", "Turning to noninterest income, which you can find back on the income statement, Page 9, I believe it is. Yes. The noninterest income benefited by a significantly lower amount of OTTI on CDOs, but we still experienced some on a default of a single security during the quarter. However, we also saw an improvement in the AOCI mark which would -- shows up on the balance sheet by nearly $40 million after tax, which resulted primarily from another improvement and credit risk spreads that we observed in the few trades that took place.", "Compared to a year ago now, the AOCI has improved by approximately $170 million, primarily again due to the improvement in CDO valuations. As noted, trading, however, remains very light and the quarterly change in the AOCI is likely to remain volatile until real liquidity returns to the market. Fairly minor item but for those of you trying to keep your models taken down nicely, the other noninterest income line increased by about $3 million from the prior quarter, which is essentially a credit recovery from an FDIC-insured asset, though we would not expect that to be a run rate item going forward.", "If you want to turn to Pages 11 and 12, talk a little more about credit. As Harris commented, we've continued to see a strong improvement in credit quality including nonperforming assets and gross charge-offs. As a result, our credit loss model indicated a negative provision driven by several things. Loss severity on classified loans, one of the most significant drivers of the model, improved by 14% compared to year end. The term CRE loss severity improved by an even stronger 24%. Nonaccrual inflows declined by more than 40% from the prior quarter, to approximately $400 million annualized run rate, which compares favorably to the actual balance of $589 million at quarter end. OREO inflows also declined significantly by about 40%, to an annualized rate of $75 million. And favorable resolutions hit a new high of 74% of total resolution.", "So in short, we're seeing both improvements in both the sort of the volume of problem loans, the inflows of new problem loans, the resolution of problems and a reduction in the loss severity in problems. But otherwise, things are really bad. Just kidding. I mean, the credit quality continues to churn along nicely.", "A comment on capital. Harris already mentioned the Tier 1 Common Ratio which, on a Basel I basis, increased to 10.06%. The GAAP tangible common equity also increased strongly to about 7.5% from 7.1% in the prior quarter, driven not only by the retained earnings but by the improvement in the AOCI mark and the reduction in the denominator. That is in total tangible assets due to the runoff of some of the cash that was deployed at year end due to the -- and runoff of deposits.", "With that, we'll stop talking about the last quarter and try to give you, as we usually do, a little guidance about the next few quarters. Loan growth. We observed continued strength in loan pipelines in many parts of the franchise. We've have an increase in commitments in the last 6 months. And know that our commercial customers are reporting somewhat more optimistic outlook. Therefore, I think we expect continued moderate loan growth over the coming years. And as I noted, we've continued to have loan growth in the first 3 weeks of the current, that is the second quarter.", "Net interest income, we expect to be relatively stable, at least in the next few months. This outlook does not contemplate accelerated discount amortization or unusual items, just the kind of the run rate of net interest income. Noninterest income, we expect the less volatile components of noninterest income such as service fees to continue a modest upward trend. If we had unusual items related to investment banking, things calling -- tendering for debt, calling securities, et cetera, those one-time items are not included in that outlook. But again, the core drivers on an ongoing basis should continue to improve.", "Turning to noninterest expense, salaries and benefits are likely to taper down somewhat during the year due to the usual seasonal factors, social security payments and things like that in the first quarter, which tend to decline through the rest of the year. We also expect continued improvement in credit-related noninterest expenses and FDIC premiums. We expect the FDIC indemnification asset, this is the asset related to loans acquired and acquisitions of failed banks back in 2009. We expect that asset to continue for about another year at material levels although perhaps not as great as the first quarter's $20 million. After that, the other noninterest expense line should run into the area of $60 million a quarter. Therefore, while there's some moving pieces, we expect expenses to remain stable or possibly continue to improve slightly.", "Provision for credit losses. We expect the provision expense to remain low or even negative over the next several quarters, barring some change in the economic outlook. Continued reduction in problem credits and the ongoing improvement in loss severity rates have the potential to result in a negative premium in future quarters as it was in the last couple of quarters, although loan growth will moderate this to some degree. Preferred stock dividends will increase in the second and third quarters as we begin accruing for the Series G shares that we issued a couple of months ago. We expect that dividend in the second quarter to be about $27 million, and we expect to issue additional preferred stock in the next few weeks and months, so there could be a further increase in the third quarter as well. Excluding the effect of any call of the Series C preferred shares, which are callable, I believe it's September 15. And if that call is completed, we would expect then preferred dividends to drop materially in the fourth quarter.", "With that, I think we will give you, ladies and gentlemen, a moment to queue up your questions. And then, operator, we'll start responding to those questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Levin from Citi.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I'd like to ask for some more of your thoughts and details on the competitive landscape. You said it was the larger banks who are being more aggressive on pricing structure for loans. Why do you think that's the case? Do larger banks have a cost advantage relative to the midsized banks? Or are they more desperate? Or something else altogether?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Desperate. You're not going to draw us into that cost advantage.", "James R. Abbott", "And how much extra capital they have to hold.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "The answer is, I mean, that's -- I understand that the big banks are blaming the small banks for this and the regional banks like us are blaming the big banks. We're, of course, right. But I can only speculate. I do note that the mortgage-related activity is a really big deal for several of the -- at least of the very largest banks and it's pretty well-known that the refi boom was a very large source of earnings for those banks last year and that, that party is ending pretty rapidly. So I would speculate that looking anywhere and everywhere, I probably would be too, to replace that. And that means any loan type other than mortgages as a place to go. But beyond that, I can't speculate. I don't know if you got any other color, James, on...", "James R. Abbott", "Well, Josh, I would just add that we -- that the area that we saw the most decline in our production was on the larger credits and that's -- we had heard that the larger banks, the big 4, had been very stable for the past 9 months or so and we started hearing in February, March timeframe, that there was a renewed level of competition. We started seeing it in our own production numbers as well. So there was some competitive pricing pressure on the small loans that we've originated. It's 5 basis points or so, 10 basis points compared to the prior quarter. But on the larger deals, it's been closer to 25 basis points of pressure.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And a separate question. You noted that you're very asset-sensitive. Obviously, you have a lot of deposits right now. When you think about your asset sensitivity and you model it, how are you assuming deposits behave in terms of how quickly they would run off the balance sheet or how much of a rise in rates you'd have to pass through on the deposit side?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We've -- I mean, that's probably more time -- a longer discussion than we have time for here. In our IR roadshows and in our 10-K and Q, we tried to describe that. But we have basically incorporated into our analysis, something like $8 billion of deposits running off and/or being replaced with current market rate funds in a rising rate environment. And the asset sensitivity that we're reporting is after incorporating that kind of assumption.", "James R. Abbott", "That's just the DDA.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That's just on the -- yes. So you want to amplify it briefly, James, without getting to the whole thing?", "James R. Abbott", "I mean, we have a -- I think, without getting into all kinds of assumptions within the model, it's probably not an apples-to-apples comparison to what's being disclosed in the industry but...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Is there a specific -- I'll give you one chance to ask a specific question about that, and then we probably ought to move on to another question. Josh, is there one particular point you want to ask us about?", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe I'll follow up with James offline later.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "If we dig a little deeper on the competition point here, and I'm wondering, can we isolate the impact from the floor run off from the changes in rates and also the competitive pressures you're seeing? So I'm really looking for, out of the 11 basis points of consolidated loan yield decline sequentially, what roughly came from the removal of floors?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I think, most of the decline, you would have -- of the 11 basis points that you would've seen in the first quarter had nothing to do with the pricing on new loans because it takes a while for just new loan pricing to move the needle on close to $40 billion of existing loans. So most of that 11 basis points is the result of the things we've talked about previously. And the 2 are, one you've already mentioned, the floors, the expiry and inability to replace in the money floors and that has been running at about 4 or 5 basis points a quarter. Although we haven't tried to do that calculation on the first quarter yet specifically, but I think it's about the same. And the other is the rate reset on 5-year reset loans that were made in -- now in 2008. But we had -- as we've talked about a number of times, kind of in the late 2006 through the first half of 2008 before the collapse, we had a pretty peak -- well, we had peak volume of origination of owner-occupied commercial loans with 5-year resets, and those are all now resetting at a 150-odd basis points below. The spreads are the same, rates have just come down. So we're -- and that's another 5 basis points or so. Those probably are the 2 pressures that drove this quarter. The rate reset, we should be tapering off on the end of money floors. The rate resets probably have one more quarter. But again in the third quarter, loan volume of that type of loan really dropped third quarter of 2008. So we should be getting near the end of that period. But we're just kind of telegraphing to you that if this pricing pressure continues, it will start to have an incremental effect on the margin in future quarters. But I don't think it had much this quarter.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "That's helpful, Doyle. And then last quarter in your marketing handout, you put out this nice slide, which showed spread on new business, and the point was really spreads have stabilized really since 2011. Given your updated comments today and increased competition from larger banks, when you update this again and you show March and April, do you think we'll see a sort of a slide-down kind of below that stabilization point?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Have we got it updated yet? No. I've -- that may -- we haven't actually gotten it done yet, but it wouldn't surprise me if it comes down a bit.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And just one more. Is there an impact from the interest rates swap portfolio? I forget if there's -- how that impacts the NIM here.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "They've all matured.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Are you just talking about our hedges of swapping...", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "The pre-fixed [ph] pay float protecting C&I yield. That's all gone, right?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Those are almost all gone. There's almost no impact.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.", "Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "This is actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. Actually, I have a quick follow-up to Craig's question. Last quarter on the conference call, you guys mentioned that you thought 2% to 3% loan growth for the year would be sort of enough to offset whatever you thought NIM is going to do in the year. With the move down in loan rate, do you think that, that growth rate would need to be a little bit higher or can you give me some more color on that?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That was pre this emergence of pricing pressure. So we haven't tried to recalculate it, but it might take a little more than that to offset it if -- for the year. Maybe I -- what we were saying last year was that it'd probably take $400 million to $500 million to offset the known sources of pressure per quarter. What we said earlier this year, it was probably down to $200 million to $300 million. We may be back up by a couple of hundred million over that. But good news is it's -- so far, at least, it looks like loan growth maybe a little more robust this year than last year when -- as well. That's kind of why we're saying maybe that the net interest income outlook is roughly stable.", "Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay, great. And just one quick follow-up. Have you guys sort of started to see any further stabilization in pricing since the quarter ended?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Not today. No, I mean, no, we haven't gone back out. I mean, this information was as of kind a couple of weeks ago, I think when James does a series of internal calls. And we don't update it like weekly.", "James R. Abbott", "Yes. And, Thomas, I would just add on the net interest income line item, I'm not commenting on margin specifically, but net interest income, we'll have an extra day of interest income for the second quarter plus we will have called this Series B Trust Preferred Securities, which is helpful in the net interest income by about almost $4 million. So you combine those 2, and that should help offset some of the pressures that we'll naturally feel on that line item in the second quarter from competitive pricing.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brian Foran from Autonomous Research.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "The NIIs, so I guess to start there, you're stable from this quarter or the relatively stable guidance is from this quarter or full year to full year?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Kind of from this quarter.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "And then on credit, I mean just as charge-offs continue to come down, as the non-accruals, inflows kind of collapse, any kind of framework we should think about for where both reserves to loans as well as your unfunded commitment could go to over time?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Very hard to say. I mean I think -- all I could tell you is we're going to maintain our, I think, our posture of being as conservative as we can. And GAAP limits are -- places limitations on our ability to be conservative. We're not trying to milk the reserve from earnings; quite the opposite. But the facts are leading to a decline, and I can't point you -- if you're asking me, do we have a target, ALLL ratio, the answer is no, we don't. And that's the best I can do for you.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "And maybe another way to ask it would be, I appreciate that you've got the kind of dual  pressures, but some of your peers have already gone much lower still. Is there any reason structurally you would expect over several years, you would be a step change higher than peers or is there just potentially timing differences between you and the industry?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I mean, there are some structural issues. But I mean, a lot of it will be just timing. But a lot of heavily -- consumer lenders only reserve maybe a year's worth of charge-offs as a convention and for that part of the business. And whereas for C&I and commercial real estate, we really try to look at the whole loss emergence period, and -- which is may be closer to 2 years or even beyond in today's environment. So the fact that we're 80% commercially oriented broadly speaking and less than 20% consumer, whereas some others are much heavier consumer would lead some others to have a lower reserve ratio than us permanently. But not if -- I wouldn't think so if you adjust for composition.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "If I could sneak one last one last in, can you just remind us where the CDO swap stands and what the decision tree is around potentially moving that at some point -- removing that at some point in the future?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It's still in place. It costs about $5 million a quarter pretax. It has the effect of reducing the risk weighting on the assets that it covers from about 400% on average to 20%. And the net effect of that is a several-billion-dollar reduction in risk weightings. When we put it on, that effect was about $4.3 billion or $4.4 billion, as I recall, due to both OTTI, but also paydowns and other things that changed the underlying risk weighting. And the -- if the TRS weren't there, that $4.4 billion is down to about $3 billion today, and we would expect it to continue to decline. So the mitigating effect on risk-weighted assets has gone from about 10% down to about 7% and continues to decline. There will be a time when therefore taking it off doesn't result in much increase in risk-weighted capital ratios. And that's kind of -- that's sort of the decision tree, is when is that number and -- down to the -- a low-enough level that we don't look out of line with other banks and things like that if we would just take it off. And so it is something we continue to debate. But the fact that we're still there means no decision has been made yet other than to continue for at least another quarter.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Gaston Ceron from Morningstar Equity.", "Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Just very quickly here, a little new to the story. I was interested in your comments regarding your increased exposure to commercial construction projects. You're talking about covenants. I'm -- I'd be curious if you could give any additional color on how you're screening these products as they come in. I mean you say that the covenants look pretty good from your perspective. I'm curious how you're screening these -- the demand for these products as they come in just to make sure that, obviously, that your portfolio remains as sound as possible.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Well, yes. It's Harris Simmons talking. I'd tell you that probably most of the growth has come in multifamily. We are starting to step down the rate at which we are expanding that piece of the portfolio. And I think we're thinking that we're probably getting to the point that we're reasonably full-up with respect to what we're going to do in that space. We've -- I'd say couple of things about it. One is we've been really attentive to location. And so we've seen probably more growth, for example, in some of the coastal communities in California, for example, than some other markets where we see just unrelenting demand for this kind of product. And the other thing I'd say is we've seen structurally much better equity coming into these kinds of deals over the last year and a half than we'd seen in prior parts of this cycle or prior cycles. I mean we're seeing typically 40% plus equity come in -- of the costs coming in to these projects. So we're pretty comfortable with the quality of what we've been doing, but we're also getting to a point where we're probably starting to kind of ramp it down.", "James R. Abbott", "Well, and as we noted in our prepared remarks, a number of -- new commitment volume in the first quarter was lower than it has been for the prior several quarters.", "Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Great, understood. And then just a very quick follow-up on something else. I realized this is not the biggest part of your noninterest income but -- and I apologize if you mentioned it earlier and I missed it, but just curious what your outlook for your trust and wealth management and capital markets lines are going forward, if you see a kind of steadiness there or any improvement?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Trust and wealth management should continue to grow incrementally. Not -- no step function due to an acquisition or anything like that. Capital markets, again, probably slow in modest incremental growth for Zions' direct platform, which we used ourselves for issuing our own preferred stock and debt and other things, and we'll continue to do. So -- but again, no transformational kind of change in those lines.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brad Milsaps from Sandler O'Neill.", "Brad J. Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just a follow-up question on the other expense line item. I think, if you look in the release, there was about $9.7 million of increased amortization on the FDIC asset compared to the fourth quarter. Just curious if there's anything else in that other line item. And then just want to confirm your guidance. I think you said that could drop to sort of a low $60 million kind of run rate maybe a year from now?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "James, you want to amplify that?", "James R. Abbott", "Yes, we had some -- Brad, we had some prepayments in the California acquisitions from the FDIC, and those prepayments caused an increase in the revenue side of the equation but also on the expense side of the equation. So the expenses do fall into other noninterest expense line item. It's hard to really forecast how that will behave. It's -- it really is prepayment-dependent, and we're getting to the bottom of the pool, but collateral values are improving quite significantly, as you know. And so that's I think one of the major drivers behind it is people are finally getting back to neutral or above water on their mortgages and are able to prepay them and get financed at a lower rate. We do have another year or so of indemnification asset expense to go. And at that point, it will dry up.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Well, it won't dry up totally. There's a little tail that extends for another 5 years. But most of it, yes.", "James R. Abbott", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can you quantify the impacts of prepays? Because I'm just trying to go through all the pieces in the NII, and if I did hear you right, you said it's going to be stable again in second quarter versus first quarter. Can you just make sure we get all the numbers, sort of the pluses and minuses for that?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, Ken, I think that the amount of prepayment income or the amount that would be attributable to accelerated prepays would be $5 million or $6 million on the revenue side. So if you look at the numbers month by month, that -- we did return back sort of a more normalized level in the month of March. January and February were very elevated in terms of revenue, and therefore, indemnification asset expense. So I think that, that's your amount and I think it can come back down. But again, it's very, very hard to predict whether that will happen again in the second quarter or the third.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Understood, okay. So the $5 million, let's assume it goes away, then you get the positive numbers, then $422 million is a run rate for second quarter. And then going out, you get the positive benefit from the seasonality. So really full year annualized in '13 is probably -- I mean, is it right to assume sort of a $422 million plus a little bit annualized?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Assuming no balance sheet growth? That's probably appropriate.", "James R. Abbott", "The strongest argument for never doing an assisted acquisition again is accounting for it. And the second strongest argument is explaining the accounting part. I think it just makes -- it's ridiculous.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Nevertheless, it makes a lot of money.", "James R. Abbott", "[indiscernible] a lot of money. So the strongest argument...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "So get over it.", "James R. Abbott", "Yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, let's not forget that we accrued -- we bought these things at a discount that created $150 million or $120 million of capital common equity without issuing any shares, and it's performed better than -- than we modeled in getting to that number. But it's devilishly confusing, I agree.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore Partners.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Can you help quantify the annual environmental costs that are in your expense base that are credit-related as of this quarter? How that number went down? I know the OREO costs were down. But in total, what is annual amount that's in the expense base as of this quarter, and can you remind us where that could go to on a normalized basis?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, we break out, I don't know, what is it, about 4 or 5 different lines that are credit-related? The OREO I think, speaks for itself. Credit-related expense, the unfunded lending commitment provision and the FDIC premiums, all of those are still elevated from what I would consider to be a run rate. The FDIC premiums, I haven't -- I can't quantify what -- exactly what they could come down to, but there's at least a few million dollars a quarter there. There's some in legal and professional expenses. Again, I'm not quite sure how much but a number that could have 2 commas in it. The unfunded lending commitment provision normally should be it's -- kind of 2 things that could drive that. Loan growth, new commitment growth and then changes in the quality of existing commitments, if there's a downgrade on the line, the unfunded draws also require reserves. But that's -- that number strikes me -- I mean, there could be some negative provisions from quarter-to-quarter as we continue to see the improvement in credit quality. But normally, that should -- in a growth period, that number ought to be slightly positive each quarter. Not negative. And, let's see, not sure about the other 2. OREO, once we work through all of this, ought to -- in a prolonged benign period, ought to be just close to 0. And other credit-related expense, I'm not sure how -- do you have any comment on how elevated that might be, James?", "James R. Abbott", "Yes, the other?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, the credit -- just the line credit-related, $3.5 million.", "James R. Abbott", "Well, the credit-related is, we mentioned before that we think that -- its lowest point per quarter was about $2 million a quarter. But we've kind of characterized that as unusual because loan prices were going up 20 -- commercial prices were going up 20%. So in a normal environment, maybe $5 million or so.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, all right. And then on the commercial real estate front, can you just talk about when do you think we can see sustainable turn in commercial real estate balances? We saw the owner-occupied piece pull back this quarter, but we did see land pick up as you had been guiding to. I guess just give us your overall thoughts given you have so much of a concentration is still in real estate related lending. When can we see a nice sustainable pickup there in those balances?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I would say -- gosh, it's hard to say. We've seen, as we said earlier, pretty good strength in terms of production, but we've seen a lot of prepayment. And I tend to believe that you'll see it start to -- seeing rates move a little higher, we'll start to [indiscernible] some of the prepayment activity. And in the meantime, you've had increased activity from insurance companies, a healthier CMBS market, etc. So it's a little hard to say. We're spinning the wheels pretty fast to stay nearly in place, but it's a little higher rate environment, I think would actually be helpful that way. On the construction side, you're not going to see much in way of land development. I mean, we just don't have a lot of appetite for that at all. And other kinds of construction, as mentioned, multifamily, that's probably smalling down. We'll see some growth in outstandings. We'll see as the commitments are drawn down that are out there. But I wouldn't look for that piece of the portfolio to become nearly as significant as it was 5 years ago. So I rather expect that, over time, you'll see more emphasis generally on the commercial categories, some consumer. We'd hope to stabilize commercial real estate, see it maybe grow a little bit, but it's not going to see the kind of growth that we've maybe seen in past cycles or as activity picks up in the economy.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Todd Hagerman from Sterne Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Doyle, just wondering, in terms of your capital plan and some of the comments you made on the preferred -- special preferred, if you could just help me unwind, if you will, with the capital plan specifically on the Series C and the commentary in the release about there could be possibly some matched issuances? In other words, I'm just trying to get a sense, as we talked about the Series G or you referenced that, I'm just trying to get a sense just kind of longer term over the next 12 months, kind of the potential timing and how I think about the -- kind of the net savings, if you will, between the matched issuances and the redemptions, if there's a way to think about that, if you will.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "The -- well, the basic facts are that we're not going to reduce our perpetual preferred outstanding. And the Series C becomes callable, in all or in part, in September. We'd have to give the notice in mid-August. But we're -- but because the total amount is not going to come down, we have -- that means we have to the do one of 2 things: either issue an advance and have, for whatever we decide to call or -- and/or issue an offer to exchange Series C into an outstanding issue. But either way, you're going to see some increase in the total amount of preferred outstanding, I mean you already have because we issued Series G. There will be more, and then we -- you know what current -- kind of current rates are. But order of magnitude, we ought to be able to save at least 3% after-tax and perhaps a bit more than that on the -- hopefully, I think a lot more than that, on the Series C. So you're going to -- you ought to model kind of over a 12-month period -- well, one other fact, the -- it's callable in whole or in part September 15 and every quarter thereafter. So I would say over your 12-month horizon, you should sort of plan for all of the seed of -- disappear and be replaced by a like amount of cheaper stuff would be the best planning assumption.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Right. And is any part of that, as in the fall, in the capital plan, does a piece of that have to be approved by the Fed or just -- how is that working with the CCAR process and the plan that was submitted? Is there anything I should think about just in terms of incremental approvals that are necessary for that, for the Series C?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "By law, I can't talk about my interactions with supervisors. And once upon a time, I got lulled into a degree of candor for which I got my wrists slapped later, not by the Fed but by another agency. So I'm just going to beg off on your question. That question, totally, Todd, just stay tuned. I think things will become clearer over the coming weeks or month or 2.", "Operator", "Next question comes from John Moran from Macquarie Capital.", "John V. Moran - Macquarie Research", "So just one kind of maybe one on salaries on the OpEx line. I think, Doyle, you said a couple of million of that is seasonally high. I think last year, it ran about $5 million high. Is that still a good number to think about there?", "James R. Abbott", "Well, not immediately, but yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, yes it's -- the incremental -- the uptick in FICA payments and whatnot compared to the fourth quarter was about $5 million. That doesn't all go away in the second quarter. It kind of tapers off over the year. But a meaningful amount of it goes away each quarter. As people hit their limit, FICA limits.", "John V. Moran - Macquarie Research", "Okay, got you. And then maybe just a follow-up to the capital discussion here. Are there pieces of capital outside of the TRUPs that we know are going away? But are there pieces of the capital stack that could be called not on a dollar-for-dollar basis?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No. Not at the present time. That would include both Tier 1 and Tier 2.", "Operator", "The final question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank.", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Back on the loan pricing, you've given us some good color on this already, but I was just wondering if you could remind us where your all-in loan production rate is now, given the pressure that you were talking about this quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense for how that compares to where the book yield is today?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It is -- James is flipping through pages. It is...", "James R. Abbott", "Let me grab it real quick for you, Dave.", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Are you still at a 4-handle or did you guys dip below that?", "James R. Abbott", "It was -- and again, it's got mix shift issues. So these are -- but just based on the mix that we produced in the first quarter, not including any fees which are normally amortized or are amortized into your average balance sheet yield, of course. But just the coupon was about 3.9%. And...", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Got you. When you're talking about mix, are you talking about large versus small credits or just by product?", "James R. Abbott", "Large and small, and also by product.", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Are you doing more large credits now -- or this quarter versus prior quarter or...?", "James R. Abbott", "No, fewer large credits. Syndicated credits declined compared to the prior quarter, and it's just not as attractive of a yield.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I think we have to wrap it up, James.", "James R. Abbott", "Yes, thank you for your participation today. Thank you, Jamie, for your hosting the call. And we appreciate everyone's time. If you have any further follow-up questions, I'll be around throughout the night. And we'll see you at a conference sometime soon.

My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Clark B. Hinckley, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.", "Clark B. Hinckley - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations", "Good evening everybody. And thank you for joining us for this quarterly conference call on July 17th, 2008. I notice that there are number if Zions Bancorporation employees who are on the call, we're going to invite to hang up your telephones and join us via our webcast at zionsbancorporation.com. That will help us save money and that's an important thing to do in this environment.", "During this call, we will be referencing several pages from our earnings press release, if you do not have a copy of this earnings release you can download it from our website in PDF format and the website again is www.zionsbancorporation.com. A link to the release is near the top of the page.", "During today's call, we will discuss the expected performance of the company.

Actual results may differ materially from the projections provided in this call since such projections involve significant risks and uncertainties. A complete disclaimer is included in the press release and is incorporated into this call. We are not responsible for transcripts of this call made by independent third parties.", "I will now turn the time over to our Chairman and CEO, Harris Simmons.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Clark. And to all of you welcome to our call this afternoon. This has certainly been a tumultuous period for the industry and for investors. But I think it's useful to remember that the industry's fundamentals remain very strong and that's certainly true at Zions Bancorporation.", "I think its notable this quarter that net charge-offs remain at levels that are generally well below those of many of our peers that's been helped by strong equity levels and deals by re-margining of many real estate credits, a continued strong performance in our commercial portfolios and by stellar performance in our consumer loan book.", "At the same time, we've been building loss reserves in a substantial fashion over the course of the past year. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is up over 40% over the past year. While we continue to experience some impairment in our securities portfolio something we'll address at greater length during the call. We believe the potential for likely losses in that portfolio is reasonably well bounded and will be something that continues to be adjustable in the quarters to come.", "Finally, we recognize that the generation of capital must govern balance sheet growth and you'll see us being more proactive in the second half of this year in managing growth to that end. But we feel quite sanguine about the future that's before us and we appreciate your support.", "With that I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer and Vice Chairman, Doyle Arnold to go through the numbers. Doyle?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Harris. Good afternoon everyone, I appreciate your interest in the company and its results. My prepared remarks has as with last quarter are going to be rather lengthy today, we've got a lot to go through. So, please bear with me but we will take... ask questions at the end I'm sure.", "So, first the headlines and then we'll go through page by page some of the detail earnings, applicable to common for the quarter were $69.7 million, or $0.65 a share, which does include the impact of $0.22 per share of impairment losses on securities.", "Organic loan growth was very, very strong this quarter approximately $1.1 billion, one of the great paradoxes of the current environment is the wide disparity of conditions in our footprint. While loan totals are declining in certain parts of our footprint and in certain categories particularly as we'll discuss residential land acquisition development in the Southwest, there continues to be strong loan demand in Texas, Colorado, Utah, Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.", "We perhaps did not manage balance sheet growth as tightly as we perhaps should have in the phase of the strong well priced loan demand, but intend to restrict our limit balance sheet growth more in line with capital generation in future quarters.", "Our core deposit growth remains challenging we did see average core deposit growth of about $300 million with the largest growth being in savings and money market accounts, and some growth in DDA, that's average growth period and this we'll discuss was up a little stronger than that.", "Net interest margin of 4.18% was down only five basis points from last quarter, primarily due to increased NPAs and reversal of some previous accruals on NPAs. Net interest spread actually increased by 10 basis points reflecting both better loan pricing as well as deposit pricing.", "Credit, particularly residential land and construction loans continued to weaken during the quarter. It shouldn't surprise anyone. It's been well reported condition of the housing markets. The magnitude of the deterioration was in line with our recent guidance as we continue to build reserves.", "Non-performing assets increased $263 million to 1.66% of net loans in OREO. Somewhat more than we had forecast at the end of last quarter on their comparable call then, but in line with our recent guidance.", "Net charge-offs of $67.8 million, or 67 basis points annualized of average loans. Again was an increase from last quarter, but slightly... just slightly better than our most recent guidance of a few weeks ago.", "Provision for loan losses are $114.2 million, also greater than we forecast at the end of last quarter, and up from the prior quarter. But it was $46 million in excess of charge-offs resulting in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to 1.31% of net loans and leases.", "We... as I mentioned in the EPS summary, we did recognize impairment losses on securities of $38.8 million pre-tax which was at the low end of our previous guidance. And we will talk more about that at some length later.", "We also encouraged fair value in non-hedged derivative losses of $19.8 million or $0.11 of share, mainly reflecting the impact of lower spreads between LIBOR and prime. We don't hedge that spread as a part of our interest rate risk management and in the continued turbulent credit markets that spread continues to behave very differently than it has over the past many years.", "Tangible equity ratio was 5.97% at quarter end, and as you know subsequent to the quarter end, we successfully raised $46.7 million of new Series C non-cumulative preferred stock which on a pro forma basis adds about nine basis points to the tangible equity ratio or raising it to about 6.06%. As we'll discuss in a minute on our pro forma basis, risk based capital measures are flat, roughly flat from the first quarter.", "In summary, the NIM was relatively stable. The net interest spread was up. Operating costs were well controlled. Credit costs continued to increase driven largely by the same weaknesses in residential housing acquisition development activity in the Southwest that we discussed, and we also continue to build reserves.", "The 60% of our total franchise located outside of California, Nevada and Arizona performed remarkably well. Although, there is some signs of economic slowing in some of these markets as well. And then again, as I said net earnings were adversely impacted by the non-hedged derivative losses.", "Now, we are going to turn to the details I would invite you first to turn to the very last page of the release. It's numbered page 23 and it's got some new disclosures in it and I want to call your attention to the bottom half of the page where we review capital ratios, tangible equity ratio declined 6.2%, down to 5.97% on a pro forma basis, 6.06 as discussed.", "The biggest reason besides the loan growth for that decline our marks that go through OCI, other comprehensive income on our interest rates swaps and fair value marks on the available for sale securities. Those marks are reversed out for purposes of risk based capital calculations. So we've also given you actual as of March 31 and estimated June 30th and estimated pro forma June 30th capital ratios for the key regulatory capital measures.", "And as you can see, the first one Tier 1 capital sometimes called the leverage ratio is kind of flat to up on a pro forma basis Tier 1 risk based sort of flat to down a few basis points and total capital same flat to down a few basis points. At this stage, there is probably five basis points plus or minus of error maybe a little more in any of these measures but, we know that capital is of keen interest to everybody and so we wanted to get the information out which is in that... will be finalized in the 10-Q in a few weeks, but this is our best estimate at this point in regulatory capital ratios are basically stable.", "Now, I'd like to comment briefly on the preferred issue, I know there was a lot of noise in the marketplace around that issue and a lot of statements acquisitions, speculation et cetera that we failed in our capital attempt. So I want to set the record straight, at Lehman Brothers sponsored conference in May and again at the Fox-Pitt Kelton sponsored conference on June 17th, I did comment about our willingness to consider a capital raise of perhaps $200 million or $300 million if it were non dilutive and if the terms were otherwise reasonable, in order to support the very strong growth opportunities that we saw and expected to continue to see.", "At the time those comments were made their was a slight crack open in the retail non-cumulative preferred window, and I think a total of three issues got out. And mid to late May after which shortly within a matter of a couple of days after I made the comments on June 17th however very adverse announcements that have been side of one large investment bank and two large regional banks, basically slammed that.", "Wall Street led under written retail preferred market the window closed. So we decided to consider using our own retail broker dealer to raise a more modest amount of capital, again they capitalized on opportunities. We had successfully sold over $230 million of senior medium term notes through this channel and fiver or sox auctions raising therefore $40 million-$50 million at a pop in a time when no other regional bank had been able to issue any senior notes for months.", "We estimated that we can perhaps raise $40 million to $50 million in preferred through this route and then we did in fact conduct what we consider to be a very successful widely understood... misunderstood excuse me issuance. We size the prospectus at a $150 million to enable us to reopen the issue at a later date if the need is there and market conditions are receptive and we may try to do that.", "And just to put this in perspective every $25 million that we might issue changes essentially all equity ratios by about five basis points. So it's a, that's a possibility to remain for the future. We can also resize that entity if or that issuance if the opportunity is there, and the need arises. So our summary... our thoughts on capital are that all of our banks are very comfortably well capitalized as is the parent. We do not foresee a need to raise capital that is diluted to share account.", "We'll continue to manage the size of the balance sheet as necessary and add capital to retained up... to retain earnings and opportunistically using our own retail broker dealer again perhaps to raise additional non-dilutive capital.", "Okay, now some of the operating results of the quarter, page 14 consolidated balance sheet, and page numbers are in the upper left hand corner. Firstly, I'd like to call your attention to as money market instruments interest bearings deposits and commercial paper declined about $740 million, that decline occurred right at the end of the quarter and reflects the fact that when we... as we publicized bought us our own small business securitized loans back from Lockhart, we have seized buying a roughly comparable amount of commercial paper issued by Lockhart.", "So, the net affect on balance sheet size was roughly neutral but, the reflex, the decline in commercial paper shows up on that line. A couple of lines further down under investment securities. You will note that held-to-maturity securities increased and available-for-sale securities decreased by roughly comparable amounts. We're going to talk more about that later, but we did re-classify early in the quarter a $1.5 million roughly available for sale securities to held-to-maturity, these were largely a bank and insurance trust preferred CDOs.", "Loans and leases... net loans and leases increased $2 billion, $1.1 billion of that was the organic growth that I had previously mentioned and about $900 million was the net effect of the Lockhart repurchase when MBIA got downgraded that I have also discussed.", "In the deposit section, user period in balances, I will note that non-interest bearing demand increased $271 million, somewhat more than the average increase of the 80 something million, a lot of this was in commercial or non-personal DDA and I also note that money market accounts period end, the period end grew by $460 million, also a bit more than the average for the quarter.", "The... let's see, the core deposit growth was spread across the franchise with California Bank and Trust, Amegy Bank and Vectra Bank in Colorado showing, the strongest growth and then weaker core deposit side of Arizona and Nevada.", "Page 15, the consolidated income statement. I will first note that under interest income, net interest income before provision was essentially flat. The non-interest income, the first five lines or so that are largely recurring were in fact recurring, there is pretty much nothing to comment on, other than continuous stability and moderate growth as a general rule there.", "Loan sales and servicing income with the purchase of the loans out of Lockhart will decline to a minimal, a rather minimal amount going forward, but the offset to that will be a pickup in net interest income as those loans come onto the balance sheet and we recognize income there.", "Income from securities conduit is also down reflecting the shrinkage in Lockhart. Fair value and non-hedged derivative income or loss in this case of 19... just under $20 million and I would also say the volatility in that line, if you go back a few quarters, reflects the continuing aberrant behavior of the spread between LIBOR and Prime which shows every indication of continuing to be aberrant and somewhat volatile as we go forward until credit market conditions finally stabilize.", "Equity securities declined from a gain of $10 million to a loss of $8 million. There is largely remember that the previous quarter had a large diesel related IPO gain and this quarter there was no such gain. And then largely the $8 million is mostly losses on various venture capital investments.", "And then finally, the impairment losses on investment securities evaluation losses of $38.8 million. Non-interest expense salary and employee benefits declined about $8 million, primarily driven by lower payroll taxes and total non-interest expense has been flat for the year. The other non-interest expense line appears to have increase, but bear in mind that there was $6 million litigation accrual that was reversed related to Visa in the first quarter.", "So it's the first quarter number that's artificially low rather than this number that for some reason increased.", "The next page I would like you to turn to is page 17 these are changes and other comprehensive income. Changes on this page bear in mind impact GAAP capital. They... this is changes in capital that have not flowed through earnings and they do not... it does not effect regulatory capital ratios. And the key things that... the key things that flow through here if you're in the third from the right column cumulated other comprehensive income, are net realized and unrealized losses, or gains on investments, and these are essentially the AFS securities.", "And then unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments and these are the net changes during the quarter. First quarter the first half of the page and current quarter is the bottom half of the page. Notice that on our interest rates swaps, we had a net pick up to capital of 70... almost $74 million in the first quarter we detracted from that amount by $66 million this quarter. And overall you can see the change of net of all of these things was $82 million if you compare the 158 at the bottom of the page it was $76 million in the middle.", "A comment on the interest rate risk marks in particular, these marks vary depending upon three to five year swap interest rates. Essentially as rates in that category go up, these marks tend to go on a negative direction as those rates come down, they go on a positive direction. But by definition they converge to zero on each individual swap contract as it comes towards its maturity date.", "So, this is a...this line in particular can go up and down during the quarter, during the year, but over the life of the contract it converges back to zero. It's not a permanent source of capital accretion or diminution.", "I'd like you to turn now the page 18. This is a totally new schedule. This gives you a great deal of additional detail on our investment securities portfolio and you can see we've broken it into two parts, held the maturity available for sale, we've showed you that the poor composition and the marks on... and the ratings on all of the securities that we think matter.", "I will point out that the carrying values in the middle column of numbers of $1.914 billion for held to maturity, and $2.817 billion for available for sale tieback to the balance sheet that we looked... numbers that we looked at earlier. You can see here the trust preferred securities that we move from available for sale to held to maturity, there are one point in amortized cost, $1.376 billion of banking and trust preferred securities that had a... have an OC... accumulated OCI mark of $241 million that has been recognized in capital for a carrying value of 1.34.", "There's another $159 million of fair value declines that are... will be reported and disclosed, herein are disclosed for FAS 157 purposes but have not then recognized into capital or the income statement. Then you can see the other categories. You can see but by far the bulk of these securities were A, AA, AAA rated and the rest are BB rated.", "You can also go down and look at the available for sales securities and see that, there's a divisional bank insurance trust preferred, which we noted a lot interest in that categories as well most of this AAA rated, and most of the securities have been previously purchase form Lockhart securities to reduce its needs for commercial paper funding.", "We bought them on to the balance sheet for that purpose. All of these...excuse me, all of the available for sales securities course to mark-to-market fully every quarter, and that marks goes to the income statement. So, there is no second from the right column there and in the total, the total unrecognized loss pre-tax in all of the securities portfolio, therefore, that has already impacted capital is $355 million, that's the very bottom of the second column from the left. And there is an addition of about a $185 million of declines in value that has not been so recognized, but is here disclosed.", "We expected for the end of the last quarter and earliest quarter that this... the market for these securities would become highly illiquid and very difficult of value. But we also had done... knew a lot about the quality of the underlying composition of these issues. We taught that the fair values, therefore, would become difficult to obtain and would decline even in the absence of other, of real impairment or loss content or at least well in excess of whatever the ultimate loss might be.", "We also had the ability and intent to hold on to maturity and as for those reasons to reduce the volatility in capital GAAP capital, and because we had the ability intent that we made this transfer. Some comments on the composition, besides what's here over the ratings, we have gone between the two portfolios. Then we have 1.18... excuse me, $1.8 billion of bank and insurance trust preferred. This consists of 84 unique tranches across 50 different CDO deals with over a 1,000 unique banks underlying obligors. The fair value marks that are disclosed here, are determined primarily using level two methodology.", "As the market is becoming increasingly frozen up, we expect that we may have to switch to level three for summer or many of these in future quarters as quote said [ph] to do a matrix pricing, it is becoming difficult to obtain. Particularly, non-forced sale kinds of quotes in this market.", "Of the over a 1,000 banks, 90% have LACE ratings of C or better. LACE stands for liquidity asset capital earnings. It's sort of a publicly available shadow camel rating system, if you will. It's not done by the regulators. It's done by an independent service. But it's sort of based on regulatory use of the world. 97% of these have Texas ratios of below 20%... excuse me, below a 100%, I am sorry, below a 100%. For those of you who aren't familiar that Texas ratio is one, that's a kind of a rule of thumb that became widely used after a number of TexasBanc stresses a decade or so ago and it is the sum of non-performing assets plus 90 days pass due divided by tangible equity, plus loan loss reserves.", "And the sort of dividing line that a lot observers worry about is 150% and above that Banc is exhibiting lots of stress. So 97% of what we are holding of Texas ratio is below a 100, 93% are below 50%, two-thirds of them were below 10% at the most recent reporting period. Now included in the 24 tranches are five small income notes. These are sort of the residual pieces, if you will. We have been two of these to be OTTI and they are now carried on our books at a fair value of $1.8 million. The total remaining value of all five of the income notes is $3.8 million.", "I'll also comment that we did have exposure to IndyMac in several tranches in this portfolio. Even though IndyMac did not fail until the second week of the third quarter, we assumed complete default and a 100% loss on IndyMac on our analysis of the portfolio that we are talking about here at the quarter end.", "If you also may know S&P announced yesterday after markets that it was putting a number of bank truck CDOs on negative watch. We frankly expected some number of those will end up being downgraded. If current market conditions continue, it's likely that we will recognize additional impairment losses over the next several quarters. We expect that they are like to be in the same range, similar to what we have experienced in the last two quarters and aggregate dollar amount, although there maybe some lumpiness there. And we continue to dissect and stress test this portfolio quite regularly. And we believe we understand its loss content and the value of these securities and we've disclosed that fairly.", "Now credit quality page 19 non-performing assets as previously discussed increased by $263 million to 1.66% of loans as you might expect the increase was concentrated in residential land and development loans mostly in Nevada and Arizona so residential land values continued to decline in those states. There was as well as we've talked about increase NPAs in Zion Banc particularly to residential credits one of which had geology and engineering problems and the other was had exposure in the Southwestern distressed states.", "For the most part these NPAs are well secured and we do not forecast large increases in net charge-offs to come out of them. And by well secured I mean, well secured on a current fairly recent appraisal kind of basis.", "Accruing loans past due 90 days or more also increased although, not reported here but loans 30 to 89 days delinquent actually declined meaningfully from the previous quarter. And those numbers will be available on few weeks in the call reports. Net charge offs were $67.8 million or 67 basis points say annualized of average loans, up somewhat from the prior quarter, but still relatively good for the industry today.", "Level of the actual charge-offs arising out of the non-performing assets has been mitigated by our conservative loan to value ratios in CRE underwriting, a very strong consumer portfolio and the fact that a lot of our portfolios is located in states where the economies are still relatively strong. We continue to build reserves provision for losses as you can see was a $114.2 million and exceeded charge-offs by $46 million.", "At the end of the quarter, the ratio of allowances to loss... loans and leases increased another five basis points to 1.31%. Over the past year we've had... we've built the allowance by $169 million or a 44% increase even while absorbing at significantly higher charge-offs.", "Comment on trends is expected... residential acquisition development, construction loans in California, Arizona, Nevada remain the most troubled segment of the portfolio. However, we are somewhat encouraged by the fact that total delinquencies in CRA were essentially flat from the end of the first quarter.", "As we've mentioned a couple of times recently it increasingly appears that trouble CRE loans in California appear to have stabilized doesn't say there won't be more charge-offs coming out of there its just that the prop... the new problem loan identification is just not there any more.", "Arizona does continue to experience considerable stress in Nevada probably fall somewhere in between those two segments. And other segments of our portfolio continue to perform relatively well. Total delinquencies in C&I across the entire geography declined during the second quarter.", "Then finally, let's see, just coming down home stretch guys so bear with me loan composite loan growth composition and the impact of Lockhart kind of go through this piece by piece, you can see on page 20, commercial industrial loans increased about $560 million that was essentially all organic growth. Owner occupied commercial increased about a $1 billion, $747 million of that came from Lockhart. So, loans we had previously made some years ago, securitized put in to Lockhart and they have now come back.", "Commercial real estate construction land development was down a net of $100 million, it actually declined about $300 million in the three Southwestern states offset by a couple of $100 million of growth in Texas and elsewhere. Commercial real estate term grew about $370 million, $150 million of that also came out of Lockhart. These are again small business real estate secured loans but they are not deemed, owned or occupied.", "Then I think that's probably, what's worth talking about there. In terms of geography the growth was concentrated primarily in Zions Banc and all of the Lockhart repurchase loans were purchased by Zions Banc. There is also a strong growth in Amegy Bank and Vectra Bank Colorado. The banks in the Pacific Northwest very strongly in percentage terms with of course the dollar amounts are smaller. And then in California and Nevada and Arizona the totals were flat to down slightly.", "The net interest margin on page 21, bottom of the page, again down five basis points due to non-performers. Just above that you can see the increase from 2.61% to 3.71% in the net interest spread. And finally, comment about Lockhart Funding for those of you keeping score. At year end, Lockhart had $2.1 billion of total assets at June 30th, it had total assets of $862 million with a fair value that was $65 million less than book value.", "Composition if you want to take notes as, U.S. government and agencies $216 million, AAA rated bank and insurance trust preferred pool $603 million and other AAA and AA rated $43 million for a total of $866.", "So, that's the detail walk through of the results. I would like to try to best we can give you guidance for the outlook for the next quarter or two to close with that. First a trivial item, as you note at the text of the release, there was an unusual tax benefit of a little over $5 million. For those who of you trying to build earnings models, you may assume a tax, I would suggest you assume a tax rate for the balance of the year at about 33% effective tax rate, 33%.", "Loan growth. We plan to actively managed balance sheet growth over the next two or three quarters. We expect residential construction and development balances to continue to decline and being increasingly selective on underwriting and conservative on pricing. I think balance sheet growth in the next quarter or two will be significantly smaller than second quarter and that loan growth might be rough order magnitude kind of half the level of the second quarter more like the first.", "Deposit growth is likely to continue to be modest over the near term, but we do expect some continued growth. Net interest margin, further constraint of balance sheet growth should result in some easing of the margin pressure. The bringing of the Lockhart loans back on to the balance sheet will be a boost to the margin of between 5 and 10 basis points rough estimate. All else being equal, increases in NPA's and there will probably be some continued increase there.", "We will offset that. As we've noted, we're seeing some improvement, the spreads on new loans and modest growth in core deposits and that is always EDA [ph] balance growth will be one of the single biggest contributors and one of the most difficult to forecast.", "Best outlook is probably continued relative stability and may be some slight improvement. Credit quality remains a top issue for most in the industry and we are well aware of that. Our best outlook is that conditions will continue to soften in most markets, that residential land and home prices will continue to decline somewhat over the next few quarters, but that the deterioration will not be as rapid as we saw in some markets during the past two quarters.", "NPAs are likely to further increase although at a slower pace, and best outlook is net charge-offs and provisions are likely to remain roughly near where they were this quarter. And as I said before kind of credit quality in California appears to be stabilizing. Arizona is still weakening and Nevada is somewhere in between and the rest of our markets particularly in relation to the nation as a whole continue to be rather healthy and our banks in these markets continue to perform well.", "With regard to the securities portfolio as we suggested we are monitoring this portfolio very closely. It's likely that we will continue to see some impairments. Our best estimate is that they will remain within kind of the range of the most recent two quarters and, therefore, be very manageable.", "We recognize that capital and whose going to have to issue and who isn't may well be the number one issue on the minds of many investors. I point out again, that even with the absorption of the Lockhart related assets, some pretty significant stresses that and negative swings in OCI that affected the GAAP capital ratios. All of the regulatory capital ratios are we think going to be relatively flat this quarter, even after all of that.", "Fundamental earnings remain pretty strong, even the current levels of provision and securities, impairment charges. All of our banks and the holding company remain comfortably well capitalized by all regulatory standards. The transfer of a large portion of the bank and insurance trust preferred CDO portfolio limits our exposure to short-term declines in the value of these securities due to risk aversion in the liquidity and therefore, cushions to some degree impacts on GAAP capital.", "By moderating balance sheet growth and perhaps augmenting capital with additional modest issues of preferred stock, we believe we will continue to maintain very healthy capital ratios. And do not see a need to issue capital that has diluted the share count or to change the common dividend. And we remain open to the possibility of issuing larger amounts of non-diluted capital if market conditions and terms are reasonable. And as I have said before, we will do that primarily to take advantage of growth opportunities.", "With that I will end this soliloquy and we will pause while you organize your questions and we are happy to try to respond. Thank you again for your patience.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed sir.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "Hi everyone.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Hello Steve.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "Doyle, first question. When we look at down at the unrealized loss column, the new disclosure and the securities book.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "Can you give us a sense what's the amount that you consider to be a risk and you are talking about permanent impairment we could see over the next couple of quarters, not the amount of the impairment, what's the total amount of securities at risk was at?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "You mean the current carrying value of the securities or just the loss that we --", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "Yes, yes, because we are looking at several categories within trust preferred in some of these line items. I was wondering you can just pull together like what, what is that risk of permanent impairment here over the next couple of quarters?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well that it is probably most of it, I think the lower rated things, the BBBs have more risk of that than the As, AAs and AAAs. So as you can see the BBB numbers there are, you can, I mean you can add them up and so we haven't actually tried to say what are the dollar value of the... face value of the securities that will fall, what we have stressed to it indicated that, we might see OTTI or impairments of kind of in that aggregate to similar kinds of levels that we have shown in the last couple of quarters, going out several more quarters.", "So if you extrapolate that, if you had $30 million, $40 million a quarter, you can get to numbers that are $100 million of loss over a few quarters and I'm not saying that can be even, but we've got 84 different issues in here. And they will, if those would become stress, we will do so one at a time and it's relatively... there's no one issue that is $400 million or $500 million of the $1.05 billion. They are all kind of we most of what we own are in the $40... $20 to $60 million per security kinds of buckets.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "That's actually helpful. Yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "When we look at the residential construction book including land what was the balance of that at the end of the quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Residential only as opposed to what we put on the schedule?", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "Yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Which was do you have that [Multiple Speakers] give us a minute while we're flip through the binder.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "And then the follow up to that was what portion of those were in non-accrual at the end of the quarter?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The answer to the first question is --", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "$3.472 billion.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "$3.472 billion is residential land acquisition development.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "And Harry what percent of that is in non-accrual?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "What percent of that is in non-accrual... that I don't know I would say... I'll give you this I think in Arizona and Nevada and California those portions are probably 30% to 50% now credibly [ph] to criticize the class by amounts were 30% to 50% it's a lot smaller that dampens on non-accrual. I'd say most of the... lets see back into another way Jerry if you just subtract the out for two large ones there in Utah and kind of an estimate of the other stuff from the total. You probably get to.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "And I dare say I mean total non-accrual loans were $569 million roughly and probably $475 million something like that.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "Is residential?.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Residential, I would guess.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "Okay and", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Not much outside of the residential land acquisition development category and a little bit in the owner occupied, probably that... it's not much. I am sorry we just don't have a specific number.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.", "No that's helpful thanks guys.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Abbot with FBR. Please proceed.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello James.", "James Abbot - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "Good evening. Wondered if you could touch on the subordination levels of the different tranches of bank trust preferreds and walk us through what it would take for I understand as the rating agencies may change the rating and would cause an OTTI but I'm more concerned I guess about the cash flow impairment and how much subordination is there at within some of those BBBs and single As so forth.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "First I wanted to correct something here, a rating does not cause OTTI, I mean the rating agencies lowering rating on a security does not cause OTTI only the not receiving the cash flow will get you to OTTI has been like a [Multiple Speakers]", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Or expecting that we won't receive the cash flows in a timely manner in fact we've OTTI some securities that by your definition would not have been if we were just looking at the ratings.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "One of the securities we OTTI this quarter has a double AA plus rating from S&P today.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "So there levels of subordination range from in the worst case mid to low single digits in the high... in the best case well above 30%. There is I believe no security in which it would take at least on average two to three more bank failures in that pool to cause an impairment of our collateral level.", "So... and to put it in perspective we had taking into account in this evaluation that we've done here. We had 22 individual bank names out of the 1,000 50ish that were deferring or defaulted at quarter end. So about 2.2% or there about are at that level. I don't know if there is any other comment you want to make Harris about.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I might just talk a little about one of that we've stressed test this in a couple of different ways, and this might be useful to know. If you take... we talked earlier about this Texas ratio another word is non-performing assets basically divided by equity plus loss reserves. If you take all of the underlying banks that have a Texas ratio of 90% and above and assume that all of those... all of the securities from those banks are, have a value of zero and if you assume that banks with the Texas ratios of 50% to 90% have a value of let's say I think we used 50% and everything else is okay. That's where we get to the idea that over the course of kind of the next year you could have a cumulative amount of loss similar to what we've seen over the last kind of quarter or so.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "We just project that amount forward.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Its annualized. That's how we get to that number and that's... I think that's the most useful way to think about this because subordination levels don't mean much if you don't have much in a particular security. Really the only way to make any sense of it is to model this out and apply probabilities of default and loss given default in light of subordination levels in each of the individual securities and that's what we've done. And fortunately with bank trust preferred securities you actually have the luxury of a lot of public data, should we call it reports that's reasonably current within the last three months and it gives you a lot of data with which to make those kinds of judgments so that's how we've gone about trying to stress test this.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, and having done we're... to be very candid we're aware of some other rumors floating around out there that we have a 50% loss exposure on $2 billion of these securities. We can't get to anything close to that number.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Short of something worse in the great depression and I... most people are saying that this isn't going to get that bad and if you look at the FDIC's trouble bank list, which is currently with the Chairman of the FDIC says that 90 banks, it was 1,500 back in 1990, it'll get worse than 90, I'm sure of that.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Worse than 90 banks.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes worse than 90 banks. I'm sorry, but its... we think by stressing this again at kind of a 100% loss on those that get over 90% Texas ratio and watching that, we'll keep applying that, but that's how we're kind of watching this in light sort of outset that we think it remains a reasonably digestable kind of an issue for us.", "James Abbot - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "Okay, that's very helpful. A quick follow up well I got you on the real estate owned category. There was a big jump there, just wondering if I could understand what was taking place there, was there a timing issue that allowed that to happen that way, was the... tell us, take us to why that jump is quite so much?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Other real estate owned, why did they jump?", "James Abbot - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "Yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Because we completed foreclosures on number of properties that were distressed in Arizona in particular and a little bit in some other areas. I think the other important thing to note is that, I think they foreclosed on a total of 52 properties in Arizona so far this year. And they've disposed of 13 or 15 of those and have another 20 some odd in the process of resolution. So we're continuing to work through those numbers.", "Go ahead and speak up Jerry.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes there was one big... there was one large win in Utah Doyle that would be added to that. So its primarily Utah and Arizona.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "That's the one Jerry is referring to as the one I described as having geology and infrastructure, soil engineering kinds of problems that was 25 million of that jump.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "17 million.", "Doyle L.

Please proceed sir.", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Jerry if you are there I wish you could give us little color call on the residential instruction loans that you are sitting on today. How much have been written down in terms of the original loan book and what do you have right now allocated in reserves to those loans as a percent of original?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "As a percent of the original amount,", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't have those numbers in front me. We can only... are reserving on substandard credits, we are reserving 10% to 12% and of the majority of the loans that are included in our credit size, classified assets are made of residential subdivisions and some land and development. That's... those are the primary components.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. I think, it's fair to say though I mean most of the net charge-offs that you've seen here in the last 12 months have been in the residential development and construction portfolio. And so, you just kind of cumulate those numbers. That's essentially what has been --", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It was down, but also have to know that lot of these deals have, they were earlier staged deals before land values, rose that will have very strong sponsors or lot of equity. You simply can't apply a broad rush to the loan portfolio.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "During the last quarter about 40% of our charge downs were residential based loans.", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, and I wonder, Jerry too, if you could, if you have this on... the breakdown geographically, maybe of the NPAs, say in California or Arizona or Nevada today?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "How much of the total NPAs are in those three states?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "It's a pretty high percentage. Or do you want it state by state?", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "State by state.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Oh, well.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "If you give us some... why don't... come back to me.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Let's go on to next question. We will be looking that up and we will provide --", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Try to give you that answer.", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thank you.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "All right, operator we will take the next question now.", "Operator", "Okay, and again your next question comes from Brian Foran with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "Hey, guys how are you?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Fine Brian, how are you?", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "Good. I guess, can you talk about the movement of the securities to held-to-maturity and what drove that decision. I know you talked about them being hard to value, but I guess we haven't seen that at other banks and if you are going to move anymore to held-to-maturity going forward?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well I thought I covered that very thoroughly. I am sorry you missed it. So, I'll repeat. I apologize to the rest of you.", "We did think that this would be... that these securities would become increasingly illiquid, as concerns about banks stresses and bank failures amounted. That approach would become much more difficult to obtain and if they would, even if we ever intended to sell them which we had not, we really thought we would... we are buying them as an investment that they would become very hard to sell.", "They also.... because in AFS securities, the evaluation marks go through GAAP capital through OCI. We thought that as those stresses mounted, those valuations marks were likely to deteriorate sharply and deteriorate far more than the underlying quality of the issues themselves after we had looked at the underlying quality of the issues, both when we bought them and when we made the decision, that moved them to held-to-maturity.", "We therefore, thought that they would become a source of speculation that we would have to raise capital, because the OCI marks would become very negative on these securities and we wanted to avoid that artificial pressure. So we transferred them to held-to-maturity that has the affect of freezing in place, the OCI mark, in OCI on those securities at that date. And that OCI mark then accretes back over the remaining life of the security. So long as the security does not go OTTI.", "Any future changes in valuation in the security that are not permanent, then go, are disclosed as we have here pursuant to FAS 157 but do not affect capital or earnings again unless the security goes OTTI. For any security that does, it might be deemed in the future to be OTTI, we recognized then the full fair value mark both that which is in OCI and then either does not through income at the time take the loss to the income statement and then back out that piece of OCI. And that's purely, and simply why we did it. We embedded it our bank regulators and with our external auditors, prior to taking that decision to make sure that we fully understood the appropriateness in the accounting treatment and regulatory treatment of it. So I hope that's helpful.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "That is, if apologize if I missed, so repeat. So just an --", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Just one other comment here. If you actually go and look at FASB 115, which I wouldencourage you to do which is in fact the FASB that is operative here. You'll find that in FASB 115, it says that if the conditions change after a security is purchased and certainly if the intent changes, it's appropriate and desirable for a bank to move the securities from available for sale to held to maturity. So what we did is clearly within the intent of FASB 115, and our auditors of course agree with that.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "Okay got it and just so in matching up your tangible common ratio to peers, so I should on the 55 this quarter, rather than if I got my math right the 525 if I include this kind of held to maturity OCI and that's the ratio that will be focused on going forward?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well 55, I guess he's subtracting the perpetual preferred.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "Yes. Sorry just...in stacking you up against peers just on tangible comment?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. You simply back out the effect of $240 million of perpetual preferred from the tangible equity ratio which we disclosed at as being a 5.97% or 6.06 pro forma. That's correct.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Before we take the next question operator, we have the answer I think to the previous one, Gerry?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "The total amount of non-accrual loans that we have are $570 million. A break down on that by bank is as follows $176 million in the UTAH, Idaho bank, about one-third of that amount is one credit that Doyle has previously mentioned, $92 million in California, $37 million in Texas and $122 million in Arizona, $126 million in Nevada and $16 million in Colorado.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And, that's not the answer...or the answer of the question you though you're asking jump back on and get back in the queue and we'll take another stab, but hopefully that addresses your question. Okay next question, moderator.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Usdin with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Ken.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Hi, Doyle, How are you doing, hi good [indiscernible].", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, the remaining $862 million of securities in Lockhart, so I've describe the composition of them. There are no more, none of those securities is susceptible to the event that occurred this quarter, where they were rated...where they had an MBIA wrap. They were all loans that had been securitized. MBIA gets down graded below AA minus and then we hope that triggers the liquidity agreement, we buy them out. They come back as loans. There are no more such securities, so the rest of the stuff that's in there can only come out for two reasons. Its not -- we don't have he discretion, again because QSPE is supposed to be -- to use the apt term of bring debt entity; we don't have the discretion to decide, to go reach in and pull securities out of there.", "So the bank and bank trust prefers that are AAA or the other asset... the other securities that are AAA and AA. If, and as, any issue, any one issue were to be down rated below AA minus, that particular issue would be bought out under the liquidity agreement at it's then carrying interim value and brought back on to our balance sheet at fair value and the difference for that security, if any, would be recognized as a lost of income.", "Of course the governments and agencies, we don't think are probably susceptible to that downgrade, I haven't heard of speculation that U.S. government is about to go below AA minus. But that's the way it would work, the only other event that could trigger besides a downgrade it was specific security would be a failure of Lockhart to sell all of its commercial paper which I would deem to be reasonably unlikely at this point but, it could happen.", "The finally, there has been a lot of speculation, well it's not speculation I think the SEC has asked the FASB to do a thorough re-look at the accounting rules governing this entity and all the commentary and direction that I get indicates that there is a strong bias towards somehow or another eliminating these things by the end of 2009 not the end of... or may be 2010 I haven't heard anybody though postulate something earlier than 2009.", "So, the likelihood is it sort of stays in this reduced form and slowly decreases as normal pay offs occur and occasionally as a security might be downgraded.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "And on that point Doyle, can you give us any sense of what the... whether or not the AAA trust preferreds that are remaining in the conduit have a... I don't know I guess a similar loss content potential as the ones that you described earlier that are on the balance sheet.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well there are I say, I said I think the AAA stuff that's on the balance sheet and AAA stuff here would be somewhat similar in character and they are AAA. So the lost content in these a whole lot smaller than say the BBB's we would think but again a downgrade and I don't... and as I said here I don't know whether any of these securities were among those put on outlook by S&P last night. David's saying he doesn't think so.", "David E. Blackford - EVP, CEO of California Bank & Trust", "I don't know.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Ohno, he is saying he doesn't know either. But if one of them were downgraded at the end of this outlook period or whatever below AA minus we would have to buy that security out", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, my second question just relates to loans loss reserving and the allowance more generally speaking granted with the pretty big spike in NPAs as you have discussed and also in past dues, the reserve only built by a little bit this quarter and you did speak to obviously the reserve in provisions kind of remaining adequate or remaining elevated, I should say so. Can you just walk us through... you referred to the types of content and the types of geographies that some of your... that a good portion of your loans are into it just seemed that perhaps the reserve looks a little likes still versus peers there, can you just help us come through with your reserve adequacy and whether or not you get to really have to continue to build the reserve from here?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I would offer several comments and then Jerry may have more. One is that we have indicated we do expect to continue to build the reserve for in the next few quarters. Second, as even as these publicly disclosed things non-performing levels and so forth have increased the provisions that we have made in excess of losses have pushed us up steadily within the calculated reserve range that comes out of our reserving process.", "If you go back a few quarters we were a little above the mid point, we're now well up in the upper quartile of that range pushing up toward the high end of the range. And that my third comment would be on, every time we get a lot of these non-performing assets are secured. There is this collateral behind them. We reappraised that collateral in some cases three times, lot of it more than once, over the last year as it's continuing to be and we have taken charge-offs, if and as appropriate as those collateral values have come down and when we take a charge-off, we... for those reasons we typically bring it down to 88% of appraised value to allow for further costs of disposition and decline and so forth. So, we've taken charge-downs as it's occurred. The appraisals on the distressed properties are pretty current and so that's why we feel comfortable that the reserve is adequate.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I might also additional, I think one of the things notable about our portfolio, we have a reasonably low percentage, and it's become increasingly smaller, of our total portfolio is in consumer and residential mortgage loans. It's about 16.7%, 17% or something of the portfolio currently. And so as compared to some banks, where they, that portfolio never showed the problems in that, and our consumer portfolio never shows it's non-performing assets.", "They get out six months, they get charged-off and so I mean, one other things I would encourage you to think about comparisons is the fact that a larger portion of our problem loans are going to show in non-performing and sometimes we would simply take amount of charge-offs and consequently, I think I do think it's useful to look at net charge-off numbers as well because it's... I guess, the other thing I would say about the consumer portfolio is, we do have... it's performing exceptionally well and so, that relieves some load on reserve and then changes the comparison, I think in terms of NPA ratios.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, great thanks very much, [indiscernible].", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with KBW, please proceed.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Good Afternoon.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well Brain.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Just a couple of quick questions, in the non-performing asset schedule, and I know Doyle mentioned this earlier, I am sorry, to someone else at this, but you talked about the increase in the 90 days past due, did you give a sort of breakout of what type of collateral or loan type that increase was at $24 million?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "It would been a mixture of both C&I and CRE with the performance of being in the commercial real estate.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay, Gerry. So that CRE, the residential construction component of CRE that terms?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Yes, residential side of it. Thank you, as far as the commercial side of CRE, we are seeing very little increase in delinquencies and classifieds in that segment. So, it's primarily residential.", "Doyle L.

Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "We are not seeing stresses of any particular note there.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. And earlier you mentioned that with the movement into ORE [ph] in the second quarter a lot of that related to the Arizona properties that were distressed and foreclosed and I think you mentioned that there were 13 or 15 properties that have been disposed so far in 2008?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Yes, I had an email of that and I'm not sure I brought it with me. It's come out in the, and one of the larger properties that we have there, it's contract and should close in August.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay, I mean would you know off the top of your head, what sort of loss severity you might have seen on the sale and disposal of these properties in Arizona?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "We've got... it's very near to carrying value. The losses that were realizing debt on these disposition so far and ones that are under contract are aggregate to less than a million up and less than a million down, as I remember the report I had.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Not much for answer, though.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Which is another indication that would be supportive of my previous point, that we're caring these properties for something that's beginning to approximate realizable value, that we are not falling behind the game. And I would make the same statement, I know in California. We've disposed a lot of property recently at small gains to small losses.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "On a corporate level, the net loss in sale of other real state owned has been less than million dollars.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Year-to-date.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Year-to-date, sure, right. And I guess if... what was the caring value I guess as a percentage of the original note value after charging up and putting a reserve against it and then disposing?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "It's almost a meaningless answer because in lot of these cases you made a commitment years ago, property appreciated in value, you advanced, part lots were sold... part of the lots of loan was prepaid in an accelerated basis. And then they got into stress, maybe started, it's almost an impossible question to answer in any meaningful way. I'm sorry.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. Okay, no problem. And just three more quick questions, within the recovery line there were $7.6 million of recoveries in second quarter, anything material in there and was it commercial or what was the decline look like?", "The majority of the recoveries were on commercial... on real estate properties. And it's really a multiple number of properties. I don't remember any singular large recovery.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. And then I guess the net charge-offs, of about $68 million, you mentioned about 40% of those were residential based loans?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "In the quarter number, yes.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. And again geography is that largely in doing those same markets of Nevada, Arizona?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Primarily California, Arizona, and Nevada.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "And some in Utah.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thecouple in Utah we talked about.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. So I guess with the RAC [ph] the other 60% of the charge-offs, which you talked about having not seeing any thing contagion in the commercial, maybe you can give color on what the other 60% of the charge-offs in the second quarter?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Some of it were been in", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "In the consumer portfolio. And also but the majority of it would have been in your E&I [ph] portfolio.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. And when you say consumers, any of that in home equity portfolio?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "No.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Our delinquency on the home equity portfolio, as it was $1.750 billion portfolio. The delinquency was 0.22% at the end of June.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "That's fair. 30 day delinquency.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "30 day plus delinquency.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "30 days plus, okay, great.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "39 individuals' loans of portfolio.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. So that was obviously the credit is holding up pretty soundly in that portfolio.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Correct. Sure.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And I guess just one last question, modeling why the... Doyle, you mentioned the operating expense has been pretty flat.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Linked quarter, personnel expenses were down, is that sort of the seasonal impact, highly compensated FICO Food during the first quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. It's mostly the payroll tax, soft security stuff, that is seasonal, yes.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "And is there any reduction headcount in there too or --", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Not meaningful.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. And so the planned good run rate for the second half of the year looking at second quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "I guess the one other contributing factor that it would been smaller than the FICO was that we did further reduce by a modest amount, some of the remaining accruals for long-term incentive compensation. I guess, you can guess why that might be the case.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "So, I would guess that for the rest of this year that number may grow at a low single-digit rate, percentage rate annualized as just normal pay increases so forth.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. And the other... you talked about the other with the variance of these litigation accrual reversed on the prior quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Probably a little bit of or ORE type expenses that actually contributed to that being little higher linked quarter, if you normalize that.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "I guess there could be a little bit it in there.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Nothing material, Okay", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Nothing material, okay.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Doyle'skind of flipping through some pages to see... if we change, why don't we go onto the next question. If we want to modify that statement, we'll do it before the call is over.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay. Andjust my last question and I'll get off. So, I guess the last thing on Lockhart, I think we're been beating up pretty good. I guess the other thing is with Lockhart how much commercial paper was able to roll on the second quarter, and how much they have coming up to roll here in the second half of '08?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, it's... all the commercial paper they are selling is very short-term. Overnight say 30 days for the most part, with most of it being a weaker lasso. Its mostly rolling almost daily.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "We...of the $860 million at quarter end I would get, it's a rough about half of that was held on our balance sheet. Our banks have bought it and about half of that was sold to market place, our traditional buyers of that paper and it rolls pretty frequently.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And the total...total other real state expense in operating expense is a $1,290,000 million in overall sales.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc", "Okay great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron with Citigroup. Please proceed.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello Greg.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One, the large geological credit that you had mentioned. Is their any amount of charge offs from that projects that's included in that charge offs this quarter-to-quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, there was $10.7 million.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "10.7 million, so, if you were to exclude that credit then your net charge offs levels are quite a bit less?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, they would be pretty similar to last quarter, yes $3 million or $4 million, I guess that was, yeah that was a big chunk.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Okay. And going forward regarding that project is that pretty much now held on the books. What do you think is the net realizable value, or do you anticipate any further forecast of that credit?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We believe so.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "The value again was 17 and seven piece.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "On the books is 17.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "So, it basically took what is that amount to 30 or 40% breakdown on it.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Okay. And Doyle you had presented later in June a loan to value comparison where you'd refreshed the loan-to-values on loan acquisition development at Lockland's?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I did for three states I think.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Yes. It was three states and I think for Federal Zion's it was 69% refreshed loan-to-value. Would that be the way to think about that is that the loan-to-value that you hold this loans in the portfolio today with that be more reflective of value their holding on these loans in the non accrual lend portfolio.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "No, the ones that are in non-accrual are probably higher than that. The non-stressed ones are probably lower. Again to refresh your memory typically we appraise the property when the loan is originated, when it renewed, or when we're looking at downgrading it and we have to go out and get a new appraisal because of that and so the loan-to-values in the markets that are not under stress, that are performing well and kind of paying them in the ordinary course etc, those appraisals are included in those averages and they are probably better they're probably better than the average LTV.", "So the reason I broke out those three states separately was try to address questions, that you and others were raising about...okay in these stress market what kind of declines are you seeing, how much stress is there, so though what I just disclosed in there was in that approx June 17 presentation for those who might be interested looking it up and in the three banks of all the properties that all of the residential land acquisitions development, loans that we have re-appraised in the last six months, what were the LTV's on the result at the end of the appraisal. So, in the fact that those are higher than in some cases than they are on other markets, I think reflects what I just tried to describe it. Does that make sense?", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Yeah that's still would imply you have quite a bit of cushion from a loan-to-value perspective if you have problems with these loans from a...from a severity of loss stand point?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well and again in bearing mind if your appraisal comes in lower and such that the loan balances is in jeopardy, we charge a loan down to then about 88% of the appraised amount right then and there, a 12% cut is taken.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "So, in theory on any current appraisal the maximum resulting LTV is going to be 88% not a 100 or something higher.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Okay. And final a question regarding the CDO's. Because the bank goes in deferral that doesn't necessarily trigger their OTTI doesn't, they still have like a five-year or longer period in deferral before it may approach that situation?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well it depends, bear in mind that each of these issues that we have probably has an average of... has 40 to 60 different underlying names in the CDO and the amount of collateral cushion we have in any particular tranche that we own will vary depending upon which slice of the CDO we own. And so a bank... certainly a bank defaulting, as I say like IndyMac being taken over and seized by the FDIC. The likely result of that is a very severe loss up to and including a 100% on that particular piece of that particular tranche and if you have enough of those that reach through the all of the collateral beneath us, then it begins to impair the total value of the security. At bank deferring, is not... down there doesn't necessarily create a loss, but certainly it's an indication of stress and if they can't write the shift, that bank may be headed for the FDIC's graveyard down the road.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's safe to say any bank that's deferring payments is something we would look at pretty carefully to understand why kind of the presumption is, it's got a problem and we won't understand that before we've not OTTI it.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "May be, that's not, I didn't answer the question you were trying to ask so. But try again, if I didn't.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "No, that was it, I just trying to get better understanding of have a deferral process, because as we work our way through this, you certainly would expect to see more tax in deferral, but that doesn't necessarily result an OTTI, so I was just trying to get understanding of that sort of relationship.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Not a single, one not, you know it takes accumulation of some number of deferrals and defaults generally there. And on the... generally speaking on those that are rated BBB, that slice is going to be a little more junior than As, and the AAAs and, therefore, it will take less defaults to start to impair the value of that security.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Okay, great, well. Thank you.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jo Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Hello Jo.", "Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets", "Hey Doyle just briefly, I was kind of curious, that the nature and extent of the C&I deterioration you are seeing in Utah, and maybe why you are seeing in that market and not others?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "I am going to let Jerry, if he wants to take a swipe at that one. I think you all know Jerry, our Chief Credit Officer.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Utah is not the only place where we are seeing it at and it's a result of a number of factors we are seeing in some of the markets, we are seeing it because of related businesses that are related to the C&I industry.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "The residential construction.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Primarily residential construction. Excuse me, thank you.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Flummers and", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Roofers [ph] and things like that. Some of the things that we are seeing, we would attain to management and the ability to manage the businesses in today's economic environment. We are seeing some of the items, coming up because the consumers are buying less as and so it's impacting sales on some of the retail type establishments. So it's a variety of reasons.", "Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay fair enough, thanks so much.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "All right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Heather Wolf with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch & Co.", "Hi, there. Most of my questions have been answered, but just one quick question, I think you said that $475 million of the non-performing loans for ready construction which leads about another 100 for other products. Did you guys indicate what that's comprised of?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That was sort of guesstimate. But there are no large single, major non-residential non-accrual loans in that list.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch & Co.", "So, it's really spread across income producing in C&I.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "The other 100 is yes.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "There is no cats and dogs.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Nothing there of particular note.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch & Co.", "Okay, all right great thanks a lot.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "You bet, Heather. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Hinckley for closing the month.", "Clark B. Hinckley - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you very much for being patient with us.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, this is Doyle. I would like to second that. I know it's down past 7 o'clock back east where many of you are. Really appreciate your attention and your interest. Hopefully couple of quarters down the road, we'll have simpler calls to get through, I'm afraid they may stay complicated for a little while longer. But as my friend Rene Jones at M&T Bank said in concluding his call, I think that we're just slogging through it, and it's working our way through these issues one by one. And I think we're knocking them down as they come up. So we look forward to talking with you again, in October I guess is the next time we'll chat and I will see some of you at conferences between now and then, again thanks so much.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you all.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Audria, and I will be yourcoordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of thisconference. (Operator instructions).", "I would now like to turn the call over to your host fortoday Mr. Clark Hinckley, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.", "Clark Hinckley", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our thirdquarter 2007 earnings conference call. If any of you do not yet have a copy ofthe earnings release it can be downloaded from our website in pdf format atzionsbancorporation.com. The link to the release is found near the top of thepage.", "During this afternoons call we will discuss the expectedperformance of the company.

Actual results may differ materially from the projectionsprovided in this call, since such projections involve significant risks anduncertainties. A complete disclaimer is included in the press release and isincorporated into this call. We're not responsible for transcripts of this callmade by independent third parties.", "I would now like to turn the time over to our Chairman andCEO, Mr. Harris Simmons.", "Harris Simmons", "Thank you very much Clark.Thank you for joining us all. This has obviously been an extraordinary quarterin terms of credit market conditions, and the demise of much of the capacityand product availability in the mortgage markets. And the impact of theseconditions on the residential real estate sector, and you are seeing all ofthis reflected to some extent in our financial results, in terms of higherprovisions and non-performing assets, primarily related to the residentialconstruction sector. And in the tighter spreads on our qualified specialpurpose entity, the evaluation of a basis swap, all of which negativelyimpacted income during the quarter.", "It also continues to be a challenging environment in termsof deposit, generation and margins. But there are also some great strengthsthat underlie it all. We saw some very strong loan growth during the quarter.Losses, actual net charge-offs remain reasonably moderate and the fundamentalbusiness is still, we think quite sound and growing.", "So, we're both cautious I think with respect to theresidential sector, but reasonably optimistic in other areas. We had a questionor two about the sort of the dual pre-announcements that we made during thequarter, and I would like to take just a moment to comment on those.", "I spoke at an Investor Conference on September 12th, andDoyle Arnold spoke at the summer conference on September 26th. We felt itimportant to convey the fact that we are seeing the need for higherprovisioning as we were meeting with investors at those conferences, I did soqualitatively on the 12th as we had more information, we were more specific onthe 26th and filed an 8-K with slide for Doyle\u2019s presentation with the bestinformation we had at that time. But it was information at a point in time andwe have not yet concluded our process of determining the required level of reservesfor the quarter.", "As we finished up that process, it became very good forprovisions and should probably certainly be somewhat higher than we hadestimated, and since we had given a target range for the provision back on the26th, we felt that we are to release the timelines we could update that withwhat appeared to be the final number, which you now see in our release with asecond filing that we made a week ago.", "So, I want you all to know, we are committed to trying tokeep you informed as we have information we think is material to the evaluationof our prospects and stock price, and that\u2019s what we try to do during thequarter, and we think we do it all again if given the opportunity. We think wasthe right thing to do. With that, I am going to turn the time over to Doyle andhe\u2019ll take us through the numbers.", "Doyle Arnold", "Thank you, Harris and good afternoon and good eveningeverybody. With everything that occurred in the quarter, my prepared remarkswill be probably a bit more lengthy than usual. I want to try to walk youthrough both the ordinary things, as well as some of the unusual things thatimpacted the quarter and give you good flavor for how to build -- as best wecan but how to build your models going forward.", "First of all a summary; earnings per share was $1.22consistent with the pre-announcement that we made ten days or so ago. Thisincludes as best we can estimate it the total impact of the disruption in thefinancial markets as opposed to credit conditions, impacted those earnings byabout $0.08 a share including $0.015 to $0.02 of earnings from our securitiesconduit, Lockhart and about $0.06 negative impact from non-hedged derivatives,both of which I will talk about further as we go through the financials.", "Loan growth was $1 billion or 11.2% annualized from the endof the second quarter compared to $843 million in the second quarter over firstand $547 million of organic growth in the first quarter. This, as we suggestedin some investor discussions, towards the end of the quarter it looked likelong road was strengthening and it certainly did as the quarter went on.", "Deposit growth, however did lag loan growth significantly.Average core deposits only increased about $195 million and average DDAdeclined by $187 million. I'll comment further on that later as well. The NIM,net interest margin decreased 9 basis points to 4.44% for the quarter. I willbreak apart the nine basis point decline for you as well, later.", "As we announced earlier, net charge-offs were about $18million or about 19 basis points annualized of average loan, higher than lastquarter, but still a very respectable level.", "Also, as earlier disclosed, provision for losses was about$55 million this quarter. The increase was driven in part by the strong loangrowth, but also clearly by the deterioration in credit quality including thatin the residential construction and development sectors in Arizona,Southern California and Nevada.The efficiency ratio adjusted to exclude minority interest was about 56.6%, upjust slightly from the previous quarter.", "So in summary, the loan growth was very strong, but depositgrowth is expected, remains challenging. Our credit costs increasedsignificantly driven by the deteriorating conditions in the Southwesternstates. And expenses remained well controlled and like many banks, we did seesome impact, probably not as severe as some others from the disruptions infinancial markets.", "Turning to some of specifics now, if you want to follow meto page 11 of the financial tables. Weighted average, common shares declined$1.2 million to $107.9 million, reflecting both repurchases of stock during thequarter and also the impact of lower stock price on the treasury method ofaccounting for stock options.", "Tangible equity ratio down, fourth line from the bottom ofthe page, ended the quarter at 6.40%, down a bit from the prior couple ofquarters, both reflecting the stock buybacks as well as the very strong assetgrowth but well within our target range for tangible equity of 6.25% to 6.5%.", "During the quarter we did spend $90 million of repurchasingshares, about 1.2 million shares in total, but we did suspend internally thestock buyback after August 16 when the financial markets clearly becomedisrupted and we were concerned about the need to possibly bring some or all ofLockhart Funding assets back on to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarterand today we have $56 million of remaining authority under the existing stockbuyback authorization.  ", "Turning to page 12, we\u2019ll now see the specifics of somethings that we did talk about. You will notice the second line of numbers,interest-bearing deposits and commercial paper increased sharply to $513million that was up $474 million. Essentially all of this increase reflects thefact that we and a number of our affiliated banks or subsidiary banks purchasedcommercial paper issued by Lockhart Funding in varying amounts during, onvarying days, during the quarter when Lockhart Funding was unable to sell intothe market sufficient paper to meet its needs.", "At the end of the quarter as stated in the release about$500 million of commercial paper was still on our books. As of today that isdown to about $160 million and we continue to be able to replace the paper thatwe are holding as it matures now with paper issued into the market as theasset-backed commercial paper market. At least for us it appears to be slowly,incrementally returning to something more approaching normal. I will comment alittle further on that later as well.", "Note that loans increased $1 billion to about $38 billion,before provision, our loan losses reserve. In the deposit section you can notethat the period end to period end, and DDA was down $535 million, average wasdown $187 million. And I will comment on that, it appears that this has beenparticularly impacted by deposit balances from commercial and commercial realestate customers and others related to the residential development in the homesale business in the Southwest.", "We have seen some title company balances continue todecline, we have also seen development customers reduce cash to pay down debtand complete projects. And we think that that explains a significant portion ofthe decline. DDA balances were more flattish in the number of the other marketsoutside of those that I just mentioned.", "The interest rate bearing deposits, if you exclude jumbotime, it actually increased $472 million during the quarter. We did pay downsome jumbo time deposits and you'll note further down the page Federal homeloan bank advances, and other borrowings grew $1.37 billion during the quarter.And that is essentially how we funded most of the loan growth this quarter.", "The core deposit growth was, I would not characterize isstrong anywhere, but on balance it was better in Amegy Bank, Zions bank, Vectrabank, Colorado and the specific North West banks. But again weakest in Arizona, California, andNevada all ofwhich saw a decline in core deposits.", "Page 13; the consolidated statement of income, net interestincome before provision was $477 million. That was actually a slight increaseof $7.3 million driving that was this very strong loan growth. But mitigatingthat or offsetting it was the lower net interest margin. Again, we will comeback to that in a moment.", "The non-interest income section, nothing worthy of note onservice charges and fees, they continue to grow kind of in-line with trend.Loan sales and servicing income increased this quarter from $9 million to $11.6million. That is driven by the fact that, unlike prior quarter and the onebefore, there was no impairment charge taken this quarter that impacted thatline item. There was a $5.1 million impairment charge, as you recall in thesecond quarter and a $4.2 million charge in the first quarter. And again, therewas none this quarter.", "Going to turn now to income from securities conduit, this isthe fee income that we derive from Lockhart Funding, and since it rises andfalls based on the spread between the earning assets in Lockhart and the costof the commercial paper that we used to fund those assets and it comes back tous in the form of fee income on the liquidity agreement and servicing agreementthat we provide.", "You\u2019ll notice that that number declined from $6 million to$3.2 million reflecting the fact that commercial paper became very, veryexpensive during this quarter. The spread over LIBOR compared to normalconditions, probably widened at its peak to 75 to 80 basis points over what wewould normally expect. So, you may want take note of the numbers I am going tojust quote.", "During July before commercial paper rates for these kinds ofassets began to rise sharply, in July we earned $2 million from the conduit, inAugust, we earned $1 million, in September we earned $0.3 million and thatdecline reflects the fact that more and more of the old commercial papermatured and was replaced with more expensive commercial paper as the quarterwent on.", "In recent weeks we have seen those spreads begin to comeback down towards a more normal level, but they are still probably 25 to 30basis points above historical norms. So, while we do expect to see just thisline item return to something more like its historical trend, it may not allhappen this quarter. It may be flattish this fourth quarter and come back asagain there is the role of commercial paper, and that creates some lag and howquickly it adjusts both on the as -- commercial paper rates increased and willcreate a lag as they decrease again.", "The dividends and other investment income was up about $3.4million driven primarily by strong performance in investments, use accountingfor under the equity method, nothing particularly unusual. The next line itemdoes have some unusual aspects to it. Trading in non-hedge derivative incomeswung from $5.2 million plus to $5.2 million negative. Most of this decline, ofthat 10 million, was caused by the decreasing spread between prime and LIBORduring the quarter, which again is directly related to the disruption in thefinancial markets that resulted in LIBOR rates moving upward significantlyversus prime. This reduction impacts earnings by about $0.06 per diluted commonshare after tax.", "And let me explain this briefly. As a part of our interestrate risk hedging program wherein we swap pools of variable rate loans for receivedfixed contracts, we have retained the LIBOR prime basis risks rather than forceor pay Wall Street to take it, which we think would be rather expensive.", "Normally this makes money, and is not particularly volatile,and we don\u2019t think adds to the net risk that the company is taking, but notthis quarter. Clearly the disruption in the prime LIBOR spread this quartercaused this thing to swing more than we have seen in the last six years. Thesehedges or this basis hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133and it all goes through the income statement. Over time assuming that the LIBORprime spread returns to normal, which it has not fully done yet, there is stillsome premium pricing in LIBOR, it appears. But overtime, this line should revertto normal, but again it may not happen all in one quarter. It may take a while.It's purely dependent on how quickly concerns about financial system fullysettle down.", "And then finally I'll comment on equity gains. You'll noticethere's an $11 million gain, but also note that there was minority interest to$7.5 million. That was -- this is a gain that arose from a sale of a companyand a portfolio company in one of our venture capital funds. The gain wasshared with minority investors in the funds. So net of minority interest andincome tax, the favorable impact here was about $1.9 million after tax or $0.02a share.", "Now, I'd like to talk about a non-interest expense on thesalary and benefits was up $6 million, compared to the second quarter, butstill slightly below the first quarter levels. Total non-interest expense wethink remains pretty well contained and the efficiency ratio was for allintents and purposes flat.", "Turning to some, a page I am sure you are interested in ourcommentary on page 16. We talked about credit quality. As you may have expectedfrom our previous disclosures, first of all let me note that non-accrual loansare up significantly to $174 million and non-performing assets are up aboutdouble to $196.5 million. I'll also note that accruing loans past due 90 dayswith mortgage still accruing were up just under $17 million to $16.5 million.", "I would also like to note that non-accruing loans that arefully current, as to principle and interest constitute 44% of the non-accrualloans. So accruing loans that are past due, but where we're still accruinginterest are up, but non-accruing loans were recurred as to interest, but notbooking it, are also up. And that 44% of non-accrual loans that are current outof this total compares to 30% last quarter.", "I'm just trying to give you a flavor for this to suggestthat couple of things; one, we are trying to be proactive in identifyingissues. Two, there is judgment involved as when and where to place a loan here,where we have clearly parsed borrowers that we think are likely in some degreeor stress even though they are still current, and parsing them from otherborrowers who may behind, but we think are not fundamentally under stress thatwill preclude repayment of the loan.", "As already noted charge-offs net were $18 million, about0.19% of annualized annual loans, still a relatively low level and for examplebelow the 0.21% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Provision for losses was $54.5million, about $37 million more than net charge-offs. This reflects not justthe strong loan growth, but as we've discussed, some significant softening incredit quality outlook, particularly in relation to residential landdevelopment and construction activity in the south west, with Arizona being most severely impacted.", "Ratio of total allowances, including the allowance fromfunded commitments to total loans increased to 1.16%. And as you can see,because of the change in non-performing assets, the allowance compared tonon-performing loans was down.", "Turning to loan growth, page 17. Loan growth was very strongas previously mentioned. The largest part of that $586 million was incommercial lending. The next biggest piece was $329 million in CRE loans. Thelargest growth there was in Amegy Bank, Texas.But some of the other banks also saw a loan growth in this category. Primarilyas a result of draw downs of previously extended commitments on CRE projects.", "The consumer loans increased to $113 million, concentratedin Zions First National Bank, here in Utah andIdaho.", "Page 18, the net interest margin, first let me note thatwe've changed the format of this page. We\u2019re showing you the third quartercompared to the three months of the second quarter, the previous quarter. Weused to do, in previous format, we would have third quarter this year comparedto third quarter of last year. We thought it might be more useful to you toshow it this way. So, you can clearly see the quarter-to-quarter change inpricing, and spreads, and things like that. We are open to comments, if youthink the other was more useful to us. You all know how to reach Clark and we will take your feedback. But we thought thiswould be more useful.", "Now, turning to the substance of the page. The net interestspread, near the bottom of the page declined, as you can see the 3.55%, the NIMdecreased 9 basis points to 4.44%. And let me try to parse the 9 basis pointsin to some major components for you.", "For DDA, we had no impact on the NIM it would have to growroughly in-line with balance sheet growth, so that the portion of our fundingremained constant. It would have grown roughly $200 million, for to have aneutral impact on the NIM. Not only did it not grow $200 million, but on anaverage it shrank just under $200 million. That had a 4 basis point negativeimpact on the net interest margin.", "The net interest margin was also negatively impacted by thepurchase of commercial paper by our banks and by the Bancorp that was issued byLockhart Funding. We kept some of the spread by doing those purchase that was a[statutory] impact. But basically the incremental spread was narrower and thepurchases inflated the balance sheet and this had a negative impact of about1.5 basis points on the margin.", "The strong loan growth which had to be funded with market rateliabilities essentially in its entirety had about a 2 basis points impact, andthe final two basis points was primarily within the interest bearing depositcategory, most of the growth occurred in the higher rate categories, theInternet money market, Internet savings accounts, money market, mutual fundsetcetera. So that's the source of, as I've said a couple of times with investorconferences lately, it was going to be very hard to call the NIM this quarterbecause there were so many moving parts. They were all the moving parts that wecould identify for you.", "As noted in the release, we do not believe that thereduction in the Fed's target -- Fed Fund rates had any measurable impact onthe margin during the third quarter. However, it is likely to have a negativeimpact in the fourth quarter as yields on variable rate loans decrease, but themarket remains very competitive for deposits, and I will comment on that in theguidance section of my comments.", "Just an update on Lockhart Funding, as most of you areaware, that was under some stress as we are all conduits and QSPEs thisquarter. I was concerned about whether we could keep all or part of it off ofour balance sheet, whether it could successfully sell its commercial paper andremain viable etcetera.", "We did not, at any point in time, triggered the liquidityagreement, but back-up liquidity agreement, that Zions' first national bank haswith Lockhart under which we would have actually started to purchase assets outof Lockhart Funding and bringing them back on to our balance sheet.", "However, we did purchase commercial paper issued by Lockhartduring the quarter. On average they reported they own $232 million of Lockhartcommercial paper. At period end we owned about $500 million. Yesterday we had$174. Today we ended with $160, so you can see the trend is back toward sellingit all into the market. The term and cost of the funds remains above normal,but both of those are slowly improving as well, and barring some furtherdisruption in the market we think Lockhart will continue to be able to funditself, and do not anticipate triggering a liquidity agreement for bringingLockhart back onto our balance sheet. And in the normal course of events wehave pay downs and run offs. The assets in Lockhart have reduced from about$3.4 billion in the last quarter to about $3.1 billion at the end of thisquarter.", "Just a couple of other update; One, we mentioned lastquarter we had an agreement to sell 11 branches that have been part of TheStockmen\u2019s acquisition; these are owned in California, will includeapproximately $171 million of loans and 209 in deposits. We expect thattransaction will close during this quarter. ", "So, summary and a little bit of go-forward guidance; Firstof all, let me comment that clearly things are changing out in the market. Soit is difficult to give guidance that will be spot on, more so than usual, itis never easy, but we will do the best if we can. We continue to see prettystrong organic loan growth and I am not sure we will continue to strengthenfrom here, but then again I didn\u2019t think it would strengthen to this point.We've seen continued very strong loan growth in the first, whatever -- what isit now about two and half weeks of this quarter, so somewhere between secondand third quarter, but not sure. Time will tell.", "We do expect that the growth will come more from thecommercial loan portfolio than in the CRE portfolio, that it will be drivenprimarily by Texas and the Intermountainstates and Colorado, with continued flat to decliningportfolios in California, Arizonaand Nevada.", "The decline in residential construction in thoseSouthwestern markets, we think is likely to persist for some time and that loantotals in those, our banks in those areas are going to continue to be weak andmay continue to shrink.", "We think that the deposit market remains very competitiveand we think core deposit growth will continue to be modest. Demand depositshave been somewhat volatile, we have seen pay down reductions in demanddeposits coming from the things associated with residential development andconstruction.", "Earnings credit rate on commercial checking accounts hasbeen lowered in conjunction with the decrease in short-term interest rates.This may have a positive impact on commercial demand balances in the next fewmonths, but fundamentally we and for commercial, some commercial customers lookat commercial paper as an alternative to buying CDs and the commercial paperhas been a very attractive investment from some of these people.", "And we have some financial institutions in the West thathave been public about liquidity pressures and we think that there are a wholebunch of reasons why deposit costs are going to remain high. We have not done,nor have we seen and our competitors do much in the way of lowering interestrates in response to the Feds rate cut and we don't see that happening in thenear-term, may drift down over time, but it hasn't happened yet, more than, saymay be, 15% to 25% of the rate cut has been passed on in administered rateaccounts at this point.", "So with loan growth and excessive deposit growth in a verycompetitive deposit market, there is likely to be continued pressure on themargin in the near-term, as was the case this quarter and will be next as DDAbalances go to some degree, so goes the margin that remains a very significantfactor. Our best estimate is that NIM will likely compress a bit in thenear-term.", "Credit Quality. We are in a part of the cycle where it isvery difficult to predict. Our expectation is that, this is going to be fairlylong cycle with regard to residential construction development. We've not seenthat spread appreciably to other sectors of our activity. Our best estimate isthat we will see a further up tick in non-performing assets this quarter, maybe not proportionately as severe as this quarter, but it probably will go up.", "Losses may go up slightly, but we don't think at this pointthat the provision is going to go up from here in the near term or will even beas high, as it was this quarter. Probably somewhere between the second and thethird quarter numbers for the provision would be a best estimate at this point.But that\u2019s going to be totally driven by continued developments in themarketplaces unfolds.", "The efficiency ratio, we think will relatively stable orperhaps improve modestly. We did complete during the quarter the CaliforniaBank & Trust systems conversion on to our common platform. That conversionwent very well. On a net basis, we should begin to see going forward about $6million to $7 million annual expenses saves as a result.", "Also like to remind, kind of partially offsetting that isthat, FDIC premiums will add about $2.6 million of expense in the fourthquarter as we started to burn through the credits, that we had in some of ourbanks. And we'll add about 11; I think we previously discussed this about $11.5million pre-tax in 2008.", "Finally we're going to remain for a time somewhat cautiouswith regard to our capital levels and probably limit share repurchases in thenear term to little or none this quarter. Just want to watch, make sure of it,we see how the market unfolds before we get too aggressive about stockbuybacks. Longer term we do remain committed to returning excess capital to theshareholders and not holding it.", "So in sum, the quarter was marked by the impact of turbulentfinancial markets. We've tried to quantify that impact for you. Decrease incredit quality, driven by the conditions in the Southwestern markets. Butstrong loan growth in other geographies, and somewhat week deposit growth. Andwell controlled expenses, so with that I will pause and will look forward toyour questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The firstquestion comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with J.P.

Morgan", "Couple of questions on thenon-performers [by now the] surprise. Can you first talk about what\u2019s the workout strategy here with the residential construction loans? Are you going toplan out restructuring them? Are you working towards foreclosure? Trying tosell them what are you thinking here?", "Harris Simmons", "", "Jerry do you want to comment, areyou still with us. Our Chief Credit Officer, Jerry Dent is in another city, youwant to comment or?", "Jerry Dent", "I would be glad to. It reallydepends on the particular circumstances of the credit. There are those that wewould try work with the borrower first of all. See if we can get them into aposition where they can handle the debt load and work through it. But ifnecessary, we would take steps to foreclose on it. But that\u2019s generally a laststep that we would go forward with, because it's better to keep the property inthe market in the name of the borrower when it is at all possible.", "Doyle Arnold", "And in some cases we will somenote sales as well and the markets are better developed than they were the lastcycle to accommodate that as well. So, --", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "Did you guys sell anynon-performers during the third quarter?", "Harris Simmons", "No.", "Jerry Dent", "Nothing material during thequarter.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And maybe just one finalquestion; In terms of the markets where you are seeing the most pressure on theresidential construction, are there any signs at this point of a broaderspillover into other areas of the commercial real estate book?", "Harris Simmons ", "I don\u2019t think so, not at thispoint.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "We\u2019re not really noticing that inthe other segments of our commercial waste paper portfolio at the present.", "Harris Simmons", "We\u2019re seeing some, and I caveatthat with, I mean we are seeing some, for example, the Orange County,California office markets is recently soft. We have very little exposure there.And as you look around you will be able to see couple of things like that, butnothing that\u2019s really systemic.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from theline of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Please proceed.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust", "Thank you.Good evening.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Jennifer.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust", "Hi. How muchof our new non-performing assets came from Arizonaversus Nevada versus California?", "Doyle Arnold", "Newnon-performing, let me just -- I think I have that here. Let\u2019s see, I havenon-accruals, of the large non-accruals as of that\u2019s $0.5 million and above. Welump all this we don\u2019t break, I don\u2019t have a breakout by geography of thesmaller things. About $26 million came from Arizonaof the increase, about $20 million from Nevada,and about $27-ish million from California.So, a big chunk of it.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust", "Okay. And the net charge-offsthat you had in the third quarter, can give us a flavor of what you saw therein terms of residential construction credits?", "Doyle Arnold", "I don\u2019t have any, Jerry do youanything that would you like to comment on that? I don\u2019t know if there is any?", "Jerry Dent", "I can tell you, just let me\u2026", "Doyle Arnold", "In total, excuse me, Gerald. Itwould probably, well it just to indicate, over $1 million we had twocharge-offs. The largest one of that $6.6 million was a residentialconstruction charge-off. The other one was a commercial loan of about $2.5million.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust", "Thanks a lot.", "Harris Simmons", "Yep.", "Operator", "The next question comes from theline of James Abbott with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets", "Yeah hi. My question is sort ofrelated to Jennifer\u2019s there on the net charge-off composition. What I\u2019m lookingfor is, how much, if any, of the charge-offs were related to home equity orother types of consumer loans or was it primarily on the construction front?So, I\u2019ll ask that one and then I have a follow-up.", "Doyle Arnold", "Very little on the home equityfront. Our charge-offs historically on home equity credit lines are veryminimal, and we\u2019re not seeing any kind of a movement upward there. Those thatwere related to residential housing were primarily residential constructionrelated.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And so the rest of thecharge-offs were commercial and industrial in nature?", "Doyle Arnold", "Primarily, yes.", "Harris Simmons ", "Well, and just small consumer, wehave got a small bank card portfolio etcetera, so there are odds and ends, andwe have this sort of a baseline of small consumer charge-offs that you wouldsee kind of quarter-in and quarter-out that make up most of the rest of it.", "Jerry Dent", "And that\u2019s really not changingmuch each quarter.", "Doyle Arnold", "", "You know, further to what thequestion may be behind your question, if you go back and look at I think inHarris's presentation at the conference in early September, we actually gaveyou the FICO scores on our consumer loans and origination and most recent andyou will find that they're quiet high and we're not really subprime lender it'sonly first or seconds.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets", "If I recall, I think they wentup, and refresh was now right?", "Doyle Arnold", "That\u2019s correct, if they were upslightly.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets", "That\u2019s unusual, but that's greatto hear.", "Harris Simmons", "", "We concur.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets", "Can you also, can you give us asense of the non-accrual increase? You gave us the geographies. Was itprimarily construction that was driving that? Do you have a breakdown ofconstruction?", "Doyle Arnold", "I don\u2019t have an exact breakdownbut the bulk of -- by far the largest component would be residential landdevelopment and construction.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Harris Simmons", "", "You have any color to add Jerry?", "Jerry Dent", "No that's exactly right, that'sexactly right.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets", "And can you tell us, I guess Iwas a little bit surprised that the provision wasn't larger given the increasein non-accrual there. I was not expecting that much of an increase innon-performing assets, given the provision number that was pretty down. Whatcan you tell us about loan to values and those kind of things because we'veheard all kind of stories about values deteriorating rapidly in some of thosemarkets and so what can you tell us and I assume that\u2019s the reason why youdidn't provide more?", "Doyle Arnold", "Firstly, in our methodology,Jerry jump in here at anytime he wants, but a land value decline isn't thetrigger per se, its our belief if the project there the borrowers areexperiencing stress as we go back and we review at in, that's what may triggerit downgrade in the credit and possibly putting it on non-accrual statusetcetera. When we do that we then typically would go out and get a reappraisalon the property and we're seeing significant declines in value in land when thosereappraisal are coming in kind of 30% and 40% driven primarily not as much asprobably some of this, not as so much by declines in value of the individuallots to say, but the fact that the lots are taking in much longer time to selland that the appraisers are applying a much higher discount rates. So you havegot to cash flows stretched out way into the future and a heavier discount ratebeing applied to them. It gets you to a significant decline in net presentvalue today. Do you want to say anything different or add to that Jerry.", "Jerry Dent", "One of the things we\u2019re findingis that the appraisers in today's market and in those areas such as SouthernCalifornia and Phoenix and Nevada are having a very difficult time coming upwith what is really a realistic value, because we are right at the point intime were the sales are being so deeply discounted, that everybody is of theopinion that, yes that's what happening today, but in reality the propertiesare worth more than that and when things correct a little bit the values willcome back up. So they're having a difficult time coming up what they would termas a realistic appraisal.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets", "In terms of comp sales are youseeing that much of a decline? If a parcel of land was purchased a year ago andthen sold again today would it be a 30% decline?", "Jerry Dent", "Those are actually transacting inthe 20% plus decline, but there is not very many transacting because thediscount needed to be taken is so low.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Harris Simmons", "I would also just comment withrespect to the provisioning, I mean, particularly on land development. We startwith recently conservative loan to value ratios going into the deal. So, theyare generally structured to withstand a fair amount of decline, because youwould expect that when you go through this kind of a cycle. I mean, everybodyknows coming into it. But land is going to see the steepest declines -- thatfinished product which is available to be sold, should hold up better. So, thatis a fact for provisioning. So, you are not going to see the same kind ofprovisions across the board for every asset because it's uneconomical.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from theline of Tony Davis with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, Harris and Doyle and Jerry. Alittle bit more I guess, drilling in the same topic here. As I recall, well, Iwonder if you could be a bit more specific with respect to your weakest MSAs.And the question would be, your best guess is on two points. How much of landvalues in those particular markets has fallen from the peak and if you had topick on the inning. What inning is it in the game?", "Doyle Arnold", "That's another good question.", "Harris Simmons", "Question is; is it going to goextra innings?", "Doyle Arnold", "I would guess that in terms ofthe weakest MSAs where we have significant exposure would be the Phoenix area and the Tucsonarea. And they would probably be followed in terms of where we have the mostsignificant exposure by the Inland Empire. Butthe exposure is much, much less there for us.", "Harris Simmons", "I would actually say San Diego County would be third", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Would be third.", "Harris Simmons", "Okay.", "Doyle Arnold", "And then, there are other marketsthat are very weak. Las Vegas and the CentralValley part of California stocked in Sacramento area. Butagain proportionate to who we are they are not quite as important.", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "And you'll now take a stab atthat\u2019s rank.", "Doyle Arnold", "I'll just make the comment. Ifyou look at the last cycle it was about a five year cycle from the deep to thetrough in terms of the -- if you look at new housing starts, which went fromkind of about \u201896 to the peak for 2001 kind of the trough. I think we\u2019reprobably a couple of years into this, I think generally we would expect, we areprobably a couple of years away from this bottoming out. Two maybe three interms of really seeing some pickup", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Jerry, the last number I rememberhearing from you was that I think this was again back in the first quarter. ButI believe the classified loans, the percentage of loan before that wasclassified at that point was an all time low. Somewhere around 2%?", "Jerry Dent", "It was actually less than 2%.", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Can you update us on thatnumber?", "Jerry Dent", "It's currently just over 3%.", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And since you have beenthere, what has been the highest you recall?", "Jerry Dent", "14.96%.", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "When was that Jerry?", "Harris Simmons", "Maybe it\u2019s a pain.", "Jerry Dent", "That was March of \u201889.", "Tony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from theline of Manuel Ramirez with KBW. Please proceed sir.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Manny.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "Hi, good afternoon. Thank you foryour kind heart, as always. Kind of, conceptually I am trying to get a sense ofhow you are looking and assessing the strength of portfolio at this point basedon your experience and I guess specifically referring to Jerry with the lastdown cycle 15-16 years ago. How would you try to stay ahead of the market asopposed to behind the market, and I know it\u2019s hard to do that from anaccounting standpoint, but obviously there is a lot of judgment involved. Andthen the second question along this line for Doyle was, what portion of yourprovision this quarter was related specifically to the increase in non-accrualsversus, I assume qualitatively, higher loss factors on the remaining portfoliothat\u2019s performing? Thanks.", "Jerry Dent", "I see you are associating quite abit different position going into this than they do back in the late 80s, early90s. Our processes are able give us much better information with respect towhat\u2019s happening with our credits. Our procedures are just so much betterimproved that we -- I think we can see faster what\u2019s really happening withthose particular credits, and the culture that we have tried to establish iswhen we see a problem coming in, let\u2019s call it and I think that\u2019s happeningmore today than it happened at this stage in a cycle, 15 plus years ago. So,when I look at this, I think we're on it much faster. We are going to be ableto deal with it lot better, and I think that\u2019s probably what's showing up thispast quarter.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "Is it the case, and I don't wantto put words into your mouth, but it does seem like a lot changed in a month. Iknow you are incrementally more cautious on what you are seeing in the market,but it maybe between early September and mid-October, we are talking here todaybased on the conversations, I think a lot more concern on residentialconstruction. If the processes are better, is that the case that the market ischanging faster?", "Harris Simmons", "Let me ask, let me take a stab atthat by saying that I think one of the things that we have been really tryingto do is, we really are trying to burrow into at a very granular level,particularly the residential exposure we have, construction A&D, and inparticular in some of these markets that we think are going to be harder hit.And that's in recognition of the fact that we saw that this whole sub-primeprices, I mean, it started to kind of percolate back in about February and inmiddle of August, sort of the roof blew off the house and you suddenly sawscores of mortgage companies, for example fold up tent, file chapter 11. And Ithink one of the things that we believe, we are trying to be in a spirited candlewish, we're saying and I believe that you have this that something that wehaven't seen in a cycle before is the withdrawal of a lot of capacity andmachinery, if you will, for repackaging mortgage debt and providing credit toboth the lower end of the spectrum and on the higher end it's become moreexpensive because it's more of its coming on the bank balance sheet. And so tothe extent that residential real estate is fundamentally driven by theavailability of financing for buyers, which is certainly true. I think you haveto be more cautious about this cycle and that is what we are trying to do.", "And the other thing I would sayis that as we look at our own customers, we are looking at their numbers butthe impairment testing that they are doing and particularly for the largerbuilders, as they look at their own communities they are building out. They aregoing to have to re-look at that every quarter and its not like you have alatitude to take up sort of a big bath kind of approach to these things you its-- it could go on for a while, as Doyle said earlier I don't think its going tobe -- you are going to see the same level of provisions that you saw in thisquarter. But I don't think either that this is sort of a one-time event then itall goes away in a quarter. I think that we are going to continue to see somestrain in the sector for while.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "Okay. Thanks and then thedivision if we can parse provision between what's specific to the non-accrualsand then everything else?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well its non-accruals themselvesdon't drive, it's really the provision, its really our internal classificationin the loan volumes in our process classification, which mostly drives aformula reserve but with some cases we'll look at it and come off with aspecific reserve. That's the bulk of it. Clearly, hopefully and that's why it'strue, most of the $1 billion loan growth are not classified loans. They aregood quality loans so they attract some, but relatively modest reserve and sothe bulk of the increase was due to changes in internal classifications ofloans.", "As a result of those re-gradingsome of those loans got put on non-accrual. There is really the classification.Within that range I think our sentiment is that we certainly won't be droppinglower in the range. We are, I'll just say above the midpoint of that range andI think to the extent we apply judgment to what comes out of all thequantitative stuff that\u2019s leaning out toward a little more conservatives ofthese days.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "Okay. And finally one last thingto Harris probably, have you thought through kind of a worse case scenario forwhat the lost content of your entire residential construction work in thesethree markets might be?", "Harris Simmons", "Well we do some stress testing Isaid. Yeah, I mean we do model through what we think, higher level of defaultsand charge offs. It might look like and I think one of the things that we havebeen trying to point out is that the severity of the ultimate loss is mitigatedhugely by the what we believe is better structure and is coming into thiscycle, in terms of more specifically in terms of equity and deals. I think itsone of the reason you are seeing at least so far at this stage. We are notseeing a whole lot of lost content even though we are showing some loss. Someof that's -- there is a possibility of recovery down the road. So, I guess itwould surprise me if we saw the same kind of experience that we had, talkinggoing back to Jerry\u2019s point about 1989 and a couple of years preceding it.", "Doyle Arnold", "", "None of our stress testing showsus getting anywhere close to that, where Jerry entered the picture.", "Manuel Ramirez - KBW", "Great. Well thank you so much foryour time.", "Doyle Arnold", "Yup.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from theline of Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Please proceed.", "Doyle Arnold", "Hello Eric.", "Eric Wasserstrom - UBS", "Hi. How are you?", "Doyle Arnold", "Okay.", "Eric Wasserstrom - UBS", "Just a couple of points ofclarification please, and I know that this is all on the same topic. But it'sjust a little unclear to me given that the drivers that you have spoken aboutin terms what's compelling the MPA's, are basically unchanged from period toperiod from here. Why wouldn\u2019t that just a build in MPA\u2019s, that\u2019s just as bigas the one we have seen in the past quarter? In other words like the landvalues are still stressed, right they are not less stressed than they were afew months ago?", "Harris Simmons", "Well I think, we said, we expectwe would see higher MPA\u2019s in the first quarter. I think Doyle suggested that,seeing the same kind of rate of increase. We don\u2019t think it's likely.", "Eric Wasserstrom - UBS", "Yes, I guess that\u2019s what I amtrying to get to why is that?", "Doyle Arnold", "Why are they not going to doubleagain? I guess I am not sure why they would. I mean that would imply, I guessan escalating set of problems in no ability to workout of them. And now I guesswe don\u2019t see that at this point and we don\u2019t. We do see continuing growth inproblems, but not at the same percentage rate, I mean they won\u2019t double andthen double again, knock on wood I guess. So, I am kind of at loss as to whyyou might think that they would from here.", "The other thing, as Harrycommented was that I would make is that, particularly in Arizonabut also in California.I think I have said this probably before, as the summer wore on, it becameclearer that the selling season for the builders was not penning out very wellat all.", "And this did prompt us to, kindof starting in July and then August, start going systematically back throughthese portfolios and saying, okay, all these guys are current and paying and inmany cases not even criticized or classified loans at this point. But, clearlyif the sales drag out their ability to generate new cash to service debtbecomes more strained. So, even if they are making cash payments today, what istheir ability to continue to do that in the face of a longer cycle?", "That did prompt quite a lot ofre-gradings, that sort of change in view prompted quite a lot of re-gradings ofcredit in July and particularly August and September, as those reviews werecompleted and the associated reappraisals came in.", "So, there maybe some element ofcatch-up or getting ahead of the game or how you, but a one time reassessmentof the environment and applying that environmental reassessment to the creditsin the portfolio, and seeing what fell out. So, I think you are seeing some ofthat reflected in rather significant run up in provision and non-accruals thisquarter.", "Eric Wasserstrom - UBS", "Okay. So, to the extend that theenvironment would get worse, you would say that, that will bring on someincremental credit pressure.", "Doyle Arnold", "Even if he's says or saying thisis probably going to be incremental pressure on non-accruals and so forth thatI am not sure that its going to take -- I don\u2019t in fact at this point we don\u2019tthink it is going to take the same level of provisions. Certainly, more than wehave been seeing over the last few years, which is abnormally low, but at leastin the next quarter you may not be and probably won\u2019t be as high as thisquarter.", "Eric Wasserstrom -UBS", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Harris Simmons", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from line of Ken Usdin with Banc ofAmerica Securities.", "Please proceed.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Thanks, good afternoon.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Ken.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "One more question on just the loss rates, I guess justconnected to comments about the prior cycle, you may not go back to 1%, 2% lossrates, but certainly from 19 basis points it seems like we could still be atthe beginning parts of deterioration here. So, I am just wondering if you haveany idea -- kind of this time around, do you have any guide as for what youthink either, normalize your peak losses or looking like over the next year orso as far as charge-offs are concerned?", "Doyle Arnold", "Probably not as precisely as you would like it, it\u2019s justhard to have that kind of crystal ball. We do think they will be up somewhatfrom, in fourth quarter over third quarter. And they would drift up from there.We don\u2019t see the same anything like the same, I mean for one thing the lastreal-estate that cleared [debacle] that Jerry talked about. I mean, Harris has alludedthe industry and this company went into that cycle with much higher LTVs, atthe starting point then we did today. That part of the cycle was not justresidential, it was everything. It was commercial, office, strip malls,residential, everything went bad. So far at least, this is largely with someexceptions, as Harris noted, confined to residential sectors as theconstruction development industry. So may get up to those kind of the levels wehad a few years ago, but we don't see anything yet at least to drive this fact,abnormally high levels of loss.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Okay. My second question just relates to the recent loangrowth you're putting on. I guess, if you could just give me some color onwhere the new growth is coming in especially, in theory? Is any of it relatedto residential builders and if you are in fact adding new loans residentialbuilders, can you give us some color on the characteristics of that given thatwhat is deteriorating?", "Doyle Arnold", "I think, quite I would start by saying you can't. Yes, someof it is residential. It's not like housing stocks have gone to zero or thatyou don't have here and there a new house being built. You have some customhome construction. You have some developers that actually have smaller infieldprojects that are selling well here and there, and it's a portfolio that turns.Generally speaking residential construction is going to be shrinking. But, inthat shrink -- you have to almost talk about net growth, and net-net I don'tthink you are seeing any new record. We are continuing to extend credit tocreditworthy builders.", "Jerry Dent", "And you have stock markets as well?", "Doyle Arnold", "Yeah. There is more residential construction and developmentgrowth in Texas,than and clearly there is anywhere else and a lot of that -- lot of it issignificant. I don\u2019t have the breakdown, but a significant part of the growthyou are seeing is in commercial construction and development as opposed toresidential construction and development.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Okay. And I will ask a question on capital. I know youslowed down the buyback this quarter because of the concerns about Lockhart'sand bringing assets on the balance sheet, but did you plan to get back in themarket to kind of more of the rates you had been doing previously and have youstarted that already or are you still kind of conscious because of Lockhart oryour balance sheet size or whatever the constraint might be?", "Doyle Arnold", "I think the best outlook is we'll probably do little if anybuybacks this quarter. Maybe if things continue to totally settle down late inthe quarter, we may come back, we do have some remaining authority. I think aslong as we are in an era of, kind of a dichotomy between very high loan growthand earnings under some pressure, the level of buybacks is not likely to getback to the 100 million or 125 million a quarter level, but may be more likehalf that next year is a best guess projection and may be not very much at allthis particular quarter.", "Ken Usdin - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Okay. Thank you", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman withCredit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Todd Hagerman -Credit Suisse", "Good afternoon everybody.", "Doyle Arnold", "Hi Todd.", "Todd Hagerman -Credit Suisse", "Just a couple of quick questions; just if I understandcorrectly, Doyle the systematic review that you referenced before, has thatbeen completed? Have you touched each part of the portfolio? Is there stillmore work to be done in that regard?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, listen, I'd say that it's an ongoing process. Jerry,and you may want to comment as well, but we have, as Doyle mentioned,specifically we are focused very carefully on residential, constructionportfolio and most notably in California and Arizona because those are the twolargest markets in which we have exposure now and the Nevada market is veryweak, but we have a reasonably little exposure there and we are looking at thatas well but its not likely to present the same kind of risk to us. And I thinkwe have been through that but it's something that continues, because it's not aone-time event. We are continuing to watch in real time what\u2019s happening tothese larger costumers. Jerry anything you'd add to that?", "Jerry Dent", "The emphasis that I would like to place on your commentHarris is the fact that the review that Doyle was referring to is not aone-time event. It's an ongoing quarterly event that we do it as a deep dive soto speak into our large developers, both commercials as well as residential.And for example in the Arizona situation spend sometimes as much as two dayswith senior management going through their portfolio, loan-by-loan for thelarger builders and basically assessing how do we want to handle this buildergoing forward. Do we want to cut back? Do we want to exit the relationship ordo we want to build on the relationship? And in order to make that kind of adecision, we require the credit officers to go through a pretty extensiveanalysis to give us the information upon which those decisions could be made.", "Harris Simmons", "Specifically Todd though, to the extent that your questionwas, have we much to do half of the markets with [join this view] and we stillhave half of them to go and so is there another big shoe yet to drop? I thinkthe answer that question would be no, if that's really what you were reallydriving at.", "Doyle Arnold", "And I would agree with that.", "Todd Hagerman -Credit Suisse", "Okay that\u2019s helpful and thenperhaps if you could share with us, have you recently had any kind of aregulatory exam?", "Doyle Arnold", "We always have regulatory exams.Every kind imaginable. But do you want to talk specifics?", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "When was the last targeted examon your commercial real estate?", "Harris Simmons ", "Well we've just finished up anexam in California.We've just finished up one in Colorado.We just finished up now lets see, Jerry I am trying to think here.", "Jerry Dent", "Actually Harris, the regulatorsare going through each of the banks, and I think the only bank that they havenot have been in within the last six months is Amegy. And in this case --", "Arnold Doyle", "", "No, I am just thinking about exitreviews or completed examination reports that I have seen kind of literally inthe last two weeks, so it is an on going process with the regulators as well.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "So you haven\u2019t received the Arizona report yet?", "Arnold Doyle", "Jerry, do you recall when lastthe OCC was in there?", "Harris Simmons", "", "It's been in there in the lastsix months I believe.", "Jerry Dent", "Yes I have.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just quickly, Imean just in terms of the non-performers that you recognize this quarter, canyou give us a sense if how much of this was originated by Zions? Was any ofthis part of any purchase portfolios by the way of either bank acquisition orotherwise? Or is any of it a portion related to any kind of participationeither local or national?", "Harris Simmons", "It really comes out of our core businesspretty much. I think this isn't out of any kind of acquired portfolio and it'snot an acquired portfolio, it's not a syndicated portfolio, it's probablypossible that there are one or two club deals in there, I don\u2019t know thatspecifically.", "Jerry Dent", "There were a couple.", "Harris Simmons", "Okay. But it is our business.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Pretty much going outalone.", "Harris Simmons", "Well or with one or at most twoother banks out in the West where we split deals, kind of each of us taking amajor piece of it.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Yeah.", "Harris Simmons", "As opposed to a syndicate, wheresomebody takes the lead, takes all the juice and passes out the crumbs toeverybody else. This is where we are actively involved in originating andunderwriting the deal.", "Jerry Dent", "Most of these customers arecustomers that are in our market, we are dealing with them and at times ittakes two or three banks joining together to handle the project. So, we don'tget too much exposure to any one bank.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Terrific. Thanks for thecomments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from theline of Heather Wolf with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, there. Just one quickquestion; Are you hearing anything from your regulators in terms of where theywould like to be or there's always a percentage of loan through to are theystarting to encourage you to the build that further than you already have?", "Doyle Arnold", "No. No to both.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, good. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your final question comesfrom the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good afternoon and prettymuch everything has been asked. I think the one last thing is, just end toperiod based investment portfolio was relatively flat this quarter. Have youbet down with the run-up, or there is still some room for that to come down andif so, at what pace?", "Doyle Arnold", "", "Yeah, that will continue toshrink. I mean we are not actually buying securities as you might guess withthe kind of loan growth that we have. So, we haven't actually been selling anysecurities, but as they pay down or they mature we have not been replacingthem.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Doyle Arnold", "I think the only line there thatmay move materially is the money market, CP line which we hope will come backdown to under $100 million this quarter as we are able to replace in commercialpapers from Lockhart that we bought. So that line could shrink several $100million.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That helps. Thanks Doyle. ", "Doyle Arnold ", "You bet.", "Operator", "At this time there are no furtherquestions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Doyle Arnold forclosing remarks.", "Doyle Arnold ", "Well, thank you all for yourcareful attention to what clearly has been quarter of more than usual interest.Hopefully, we've clarified things for you. We think that we were cautious aboutsome things and optimistic about some others going forward, just to reiteratewe think loan growth is likely to remain pretty strong in the coming quarter asthe costs are likely not to come down as fast in response to the rate cut dueto external market conditions regardless of what the market growth looks like.There are some reasons to believe that the attrition in the DD&A mayattenuate as earnings credit rates come down and so forth. ", "Nonetheless, you are probably ata better pressure on the margin again this quarter, but again, there may besome picked up from a lower provision this quarter. And some of the purelyfinancial market stress related impacts, while it may not totally disappear,this quarter should begin to attenuate going forward.", "So, with that, again I thank youall for your time and attention, and we will sign off and look forward totalking to you again at year-end.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participationin today\u2019s conference.

My name is Jacqueline, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Clark Hinckley, Senior Vice President. Please proceed, sir.", "Clark B. Hinckley - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on this quarterly conference call on January 24, 2008. If any of you do not yet have a copy of the earnings release, it can be downloaded from our website in pdf format, which is www.zionsbancorporation.com. A link to the release is found near the top of the page.", "During this afternoon's call, we will discuss the expected performance of the company. Such statements constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act. Actual results may differ materially from the projections provided in this call since such projections involve significant risks and uncertainties. A complete disclaimer is included in the press release and is incorporated into this call.", "I will now turn the time over to our Chairman and CEO, Harris Simmons.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much, Clark, and welcome to all of you. I just want to introduce the call by saying that while we are disappointed by the aggregate level of this quarter's earnings, which were driven by securities write-down and reserves building, we also see in our numbers some real areas of strength, particularly in light of what is a very challenging environment that you are all very familiar with.", "I am going to turn the time over to Doyle Arnold, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the number, and I\u2019ll have some comments later.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Harris. Good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.39. I think most of the major items impacting earnings adversely this quarter have already been disclosed in the 8-Ks that we issued in December. Included in those and included in the results were $0.89 per share of impairment and valuation losses that were previously disclosed. We had previously disclosed information about these litigation settlements. The final number as we got our arms around several different cases was little bit higher and had a $0.05 per share impact on the quarter. So earnings of $0.39 with $0.89 of impairment charges and $0.05 a share of litigation reserves related to these.", "Some credit measures were maybe slightly worse than earlier guidance, but I think broadly in line and not materially different. Non-performing assets increased $87 million, somewhat less than the increase of $101 million in the third quarter. Net charge-offs were $26.7 million or 0.28% of average loans. This was an increase of $8.6 million from the third quarter. And the provision of $70 million was up from\u2026 it was up $14.6 million from the $55 million in the third quarter, perhaps little bit higher than our guidance, but it did include $43 million of provision in excess of losses.", "The net interest margin declined 17 basis points during the quarter, probably a bit more than some of you were expecting. A third of that resulted from our support during the quarter of Lockhart Funding, which I will discuss more in greater detail later. Loan growth was remarkably strong. It was net $1.3 billion during the quarter and nearly $1.5 billion before subtracting the $169 million of loans that were sold in conjunction with the sale of branches. The growth came largely as it has the last couple of quarters from Zions Bank here in Utah and Idaho, Amegy Bank in Texas, and Vector Bank in Colorado. All of those banks are operating in states where the economy remains relatively robust.", "In a turnaround from prior quarters, average core deposits showed some solid growth expanding by about $800 million. A significant part of this, however, seems to\u2026 appears to have been seasonal in nature and the growth was largely concentrated in more market-rate types of deposits. The combined loan and deposit growth were sufficient to offset the decline in net interest margin, and net interest income actually increased slightly from the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio, if you simply exclude the valuation and impairment losses on securities, was 56.6%, which we\u2019re reasonably pleased with.", "In summary, net earnings were negatively impacted by the impairment and valuation losses related to securities that were previously disposed. Credit costs did increase, but remained within historical levels and not inconsistent with the guidance that we gave. Loan growth was very strong in the Intermountain West and Texas, areas that constitute about 60% of our asset base and where the economies are\u2026 while softening somewhat are\u2026 still remain pretty strong. And deposit growth was better than prior quarters, expenses remained well controlled. In sum, we think the fundamentals of the quarter remained reasonably strong.", "What I\u2019d like to do now is, as we usually do, go through some of the numbers in the tables attached to the press release page. The tables are numbered in the upper left-hand corner. And I'm first going to call your attention to page 12, and the number I'm going to point to first there is just at the end of the average balance section, the very last line, weighted-average shares outstanding, 106.9 million, a decrease of about 1 million shares from the third. That is purely a reflection or the effect of the lower stock price on the treasury method of accounting for stock options. We did not buy back any shares during the quarter and we do not expect to do so in the near future.", "Near the bottom of the page, fourth line from the bottom in the left-hand most column of numbers, you see the tangible equity ratio. At quarter-end, that number was 6.17%, down from the 6.40% in the prior quarter and slightly below our target range of 6.25% to 6.5%, but still very strong.", "We\u2019ve previously disclosed and discussed a number of investor presentations and in one-on-ones and Q&A sessions that if all of our QSPE Lockhart Funding came back on our balance sheet, GAAP capital ratios would be impacted by about 40 basis points. Effectively, between securities that we repurchased from Lockhart at the end of the quarter and our support of Lockhart by purchasing its commercial paper during the quarter and at the end as well, we had at the end of the quarter about $1.6 billion of Lockhart-related assets on our balance sheet or a bit over half of the assets that we disclosed on balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. So we basically brought half the assets back and you see about half of the total impact of\u2026 that we\u2019d previously discussed, if it all came back. So about 20 basis points to 21 basis points of the 23 basis points of tangible equity decline, you can, if you choose, attribute to the previously discussed impact of Lockhart on our balance sheet.", "On page 13, consolidated balance sheet, next page. Just note, first of all, interest-bearing deposits and commercial paper were up about $213 million. That's the second line of numbers on the page. That\u2019s compared to the third quarter, and again a lot of that increase reflect\u2026 represents the average commercial paper issued by Lockhart and owned by Zions during the fourth quarter. On average, that amount was $763 million for the quarter.", "The next line I'll call your attention to is under investment securities available for sale, $5.1 billion. That's an increase of about $585 million from the third quarter. It basically reflects the purchase as disclosed in December of $895 million of securities from Lockhart. That was two individual securities that were downgraded to below AA minus by an agency during the quarter and then $840 million of assets that we bought out to reduce the CP funding needs of Lockhart. And then you have paydowns and so forth, which net out of that so that the net increase was $585 million.", "Moving on down the page, you'll see there $39.25 million of loans for unearned discount and allowance, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter. And again we did close the sale of 11 branches in California that were originally part of the Stockmen's acquisition. This reduced loans by 169 \u2013 $169 million of loans were sold with those branches along with their deposits.", "In the deposits section, you'll see that non-interest-bearing demand at $9.6 billion was up $296 million during the quarter after having dropped significantly in the third quarter compared to the second. Finished the year still below where it was a year ago, and we still really haven't seen any strong consistent rebound in non-interest bearing demand deposits.", "The core deposits at period-end were up $1.3 billion, but as you can see as you glance through here, a lot of that was in large core deposits and more expensive form of core deposits such as the Internet Money Market and the foreign line, which for us are almost exclusively suites of commercials deposits into Cayman [ph] accounts. We still see the growth in deposits being very sensitive to the interest-bearing accounts. Core deposit growth was concentrated in Zions Bank and Amegy Bank and was weakest in National Bank of Arizona and Nevada State Bank, reflecting the continued weakness in the economies and homebuilding and in all kinds of residential related activities in those states, including title and escrow accounts. And then finally, again because of the strong loan growth, Federal Home Loan Bank advances during the quarter increased another $1.1 billion.", "If you will now turn to page 14, consolidated statements of income, as previously mentioned, net interest income before provision at $479 million was actually up slightly from the prior quarter. As previously discussed, and I\u2019ll talk a bit more about provision, we did increase from $55 million to $70 million during the quarter. So net interest income after provision was down. Service charges and fees on deposit accounts continued their steady increase consistent with previous quarters. Loan sales and servicing income, which was down this quarter, did have an impairment charge of $3.3 million of retained interest from loan securitizations. There was no impairment charge in the third quarter as you recall, and in the second and first quarters there were $5.1 million and $4.2 million of such charges respectively. About half the 3.3 million reflected greater credit losses and then the other half was a combination of pre-payments and changes in discount rates.", "Trust and wealth management income continued its increase, up another $1.1 billion from the third quarter. I would just note that comparing fourth quarter '07 to fourth quarter '06, that is a 26% increase in one year in that line reflecting the investments and emphasis that we have made in those kinds of businesses over the last several years. Growth was all organic, no acquisitions during that period.", "Income from securities conduit was weak. This is the fee income that we earned from Lockhart. It is strongly driven by the difference between the cost of funding Lockhart and the earnings on its assets, and while the spreads over LIBOR have improved they are still quite... recently during the quarter, they were still quite high relative to historical averages. So that line remains weaker and it will remain weaker going forward because Lockhart now has only $2.1 billion of assets in it, down from the over $3 billion a quarter ago, reflecting paydowns and the purchasers of securities out of Lockhart. And once repurchased, they\u2019re unlikely to go back in. And then finally, the last big line to point to there is the impairment losses on securities of $158 million, which we had previously disclosed.", "Under non-interest expense, I\u2019ll note that the salary and employee benefit line is actually down $13.3 million. That largely reflects lower accruals and reversal of accruals for various long-term cash incentive plans, profit-sharing plans, and discretionary bonuses, reflecting the weaker financial performance of the company. So we trued up those accruals to reflect what we think will actually be paid and then that was actually a large decrease. All other expenses remained well controlled. The other non-interest expense line includes the $8.1 million accrual for Visa litigation as well as increases in FDIC deposit insurance expense as more of our banks began to eat through their credit and are in a position of having to actually pay that insurance.", "Final note\u2026 note that the income tax line is a net benefit, not a tax\u2026 of net benefit of $11 million. This reflects two things, one, most of the income after the impairment charge are larger\u2026 much larger proportion of income after taking the impairment charge was coming from non-taxable or tax advantage revenue sources. And during the quarter, a number of statute limitations or audits were passed on various tax positions for which we had reserved and we reversed about $11 million of reserves\u2026 tax reserves and took those into account. The result of those two things was a negative provision of $11 million. As I\u2026 in case I forget to mention it during the guidance section, certainly don't factor that into your tax rate for your models in 2008, but year rates should be consistent with what it has been in prior more normal quarters.", "Turning now to page 17, credit quality, non-accrual loans did increase to $258 million from $174 million. I think that's reasonably consistent with our guidance. Restructured loans and OREO were essentially flat. So the increase in NPAs reflects the increase in non-accruals. And accruing loans past due 90 days also crept up a bit more. The largest increases in non-performing assets, as you would probably expect, were in our National Bank of Arizona and in Nevada State Bank, and were in the commercial real estate area mostly related to residential housing construction land and development.", "It\u2019s already mentioned that charge-offs were $26.7 million against a provision of $70 million. As a result, the reserve increased by $43 million on top of the $38 million in the prior quarter. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to net loans outstanding then increased another 7 basis points on top of the 8 basis points in the prior quarter. And we\u2019re please that at 28 basis points, we think our net charge-offs are still comfortably below industry and peer averages as they have been through previous cycles. We can't say how high they may reach, but we think as historically has been the case that our underwriting standards portfolio mix and geographic diversifications should enable us to continue to outperform peer banks on this measure. And then finally, at the bottom of the page, the total credit related reserves including the allowance for unfunded commitments was at 1.23%, also up 7 basis points from the prior quarter and 14 basis points from two quarters ago.", "I am going to ask\u2026 Harris, would you like to make any additional comments on the credit quality before we move on to some other things?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think particularly given the environment we are in it would be interesting to you to just briefly to talk about credit quality in some of the non-CRE non-commercial real estate, particularly non-residential construction portfolios. At the end of the year, our\u2026 for example, our delinquency on our commercial loan portfolio or C&I portfolio was less than 1%. It was 0.95%, which is very consistent with where we have been in prior quarters and remains we think in exceptional shape.", "I think perhaps most notably in our consumer loan portfolio, total delinquencies were 81 basis points at year-end. In the home equity credit line portfolio, which has been a source of some concern around the industry, our delinquency was 20 basis points, 0.2%, consisting of 44 accounts out of 38,000 that were over 30 days past due. And again, it reflects the fact that we have been quite conservative not going beyond 80% loan-to-value in our policy, and we think that's quite an extraordinary number in today's environment.", "If you look at our mortgage loan portfolio, mortgage\u2026 residential mortgages that we have on our balance sheet, the delinquency was 0.72%. Our bankcard portfolio is a small portfolio with a delinquency of 1.53%, which as you know compared to industry standards is exceptional. I was looking the other day on our home equity credit line portfolio. Our losses last year were 1.5 basis points, net charge-offs on that roughly $1.5 billion portfolio. So to the extent of that is symptomatic of the underwriting going into this cycle, I think it's a reason that we believe that again we will make it through in a at reasonably good shape despite the fact that we are clearly seeing some stress with homebuilders and developers. But at this point the increased levels of problem assets that we are seeing is really very much concentrated in that category.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Thank you, Harris. I\u2019ll turn to page 18 now, if you will. We\u2019ll look at composition of the very strong loan growth. Note that commercial lending was up $873 million to $17.9 billion, and most of that was concentrated in the pure commercial and industrial line. The commercial real estate was up $215 million with all of that being in term lending. Construction and development lending balances actually declined slightly during the quarter. They actually rose through most of the quarter, peaked in early December, and have been kind of trending downwards since. And we would expect that to probably be the case going forward for quite a while.", "And then finally, consumer lending rose $157 million, as you can see, with the home equity credit lines and consumer real estate as well as mortgages and bankcard all posting increases. As you might expect, the strongest loan growth was in stronger economies, Zions Bank in Utah and Idaho; Amegy Bank, Texas; Vector Bank, Colorado; and smaller dollar amounts for good percentage increase also coming out of the Commerce Bank up in Seattle, Washington. So that's a quick look at the loan growth.", "Net interest margins, as I mentioned it decreased 17 basis points from prior quarter, primarily driven by a combination of very strong loan growth, growth in earnings assets related to Lockhart Funding, continued deposit pricing pressures, and the growth in higher cost funding accounts. In line with our guidance last quarter, the Fed rate decrease in the third quarter had a negative impact on NIM as deposit costs continue to be very sticky. We hope that perhaps the acquisition of some trouble players in the market may relieve some of their liquidity-induced pricing pressures over time. There is some evidence that that has already begun to happen, but time will tell.", "There\u2019re various ways one can do a rate volume analysis on what drove what, but I will offer the following. As I said, about 6 basis points of the decline can be attributed to the purchase of commercial paper by our banks and by Zions Bancorp from Lockhart Funding, of course commercial paper. Even though LIBOR spreads widened and the spread over LIBOR widened for that type of paper, the effective yield over funding cost was very low. So that had about a 6 basis points depressing effect on the margin.", "The very strong loan growth was largely funded with federal home loan bank borrowings and more market\u2026 closer to market rate deposit accounts. DDA did not grow in line with loan growth on a percentage basis. Therefore, the funding mix of incremental growth was more expensive than the average on the balance sheet. That accounted for about 8 basis points of the decline, simply that DDA does not grow in line with loan growth, leaving about 3 basis points to be attributed to deposit pricing pressures and other things. We would expect some additional decline in the margin in the coming quarter, which I will discuss in the outlook section.", "Since I have now mentioned Lockhart a couple of times in connection with the NIM and the balance sheet, let me just kind of briefly recap what it is, why it is, etcetera, and what's there now. We created Lockhart in the year 2000 as a Qualified Special Purpose Entity, a QSPE that is sponsored by Zion's Bank. And from 2002 through 2007, Lockhart paid Zions nearly $185 million in fees in that line that we discussed a few minutes ago.", "From its inception, it was designed to hold only very high-quality assets. All of the assets purchased by Lockhart must be either Government issued or Government guaranteed or be rated AAA at the time of purchase. Zions Bank has a liquidity agreement with Lockhart. Liquidity support from the bank is triggered by either of two things. If any security owned by Lockhart is downgraded below AA minus by any rating agency that rates it, Zions Bank must buy that security from Lockhart at face value, and it then books it at fair value and the difference if any is taken as a charge against income, and we had two such charges during the quarter. The other is if Lockhart is unable to sell sufficient commercial paper to fully funded self to Zions by sufficient securities from Lockhart in a predetermined order, we don't get the cherry-pick\u2026 pick and choose. Anyway, we buy enough securities to enable it to meet its funding needs. As you're all aware, the total amount of asset-backed commercial paper declined globally from 1.2 trillion in July to 780 billion at the end of December or about 34% decline.", "Zions\u2026 Lockhart was not immune from that withdrawal of funding. Our affiliate banks have purchased commercial paper issued by Lockhart over several months during the mid-to-later part of the third quarter and all through the fourth quarter. In late December, the markets really got tight again as the players were very reluctant to go beyond year-end. And Lockhart was unable to meet its funding obligations, and Zions did not have capacity to prudently purchase additional Lockhart commercial paper. As a result, the second trigger of the liquidity agreement was triggered, and Zions Bank purchased $840 million of securities from Lockhart. As previously disclosed, we recognized a $33 million pretax write-down on this transaction.", "During the quarter, two securities owned, as I mentioned were downgraded below AA minus by one rating agency. We purchased those two securities at a face value of $55 million and recognized a $17 million pretax loss. Interestingly, both of those securities continue to be AAA rated by the other agency that rates them.", "As a result of normal repayments and these purchases, at year-end Lockhart had total assets of $2.1 billion, down about $1 billion from three months previous, and with a fair value that was $22 million less than book value. So we recognized $33 million loss on the $840 million and\u2026 plus another $17 million on the $55 million of specific securities. All of the rest had a haircut of $22 million left. So kind of further evidence that we could not and did not cherry-pick securities. On average, the lesser quality ones have come out, but there is still pretty high quality. They are all AAA rated by at least one agency and most of them by two. Over 95% of that assets remaining are AAA rated by two agencies.", "Unlike a SIV, which I\u2019ve been talking about a lot lately, Zions does not have discretionary over Lockhart. That is, we cannot arbitrarily make a decision to liquidate it. And we have gotten questions about that, why don't you just shut it down, why don't you just make it go away. All the actions were determined by agreements pertaining to Lockhart that were set up in the year 2000 when it was established. We can only purchase assets from Lockhart under the conditions mentioned, when an asset is downgraded or Lockhart cannot fund itself. And we do have one discretionary action we can do. At our discretion, we can and have purchased commercial paper issued by Lockhart in lieu of buying securities from Lockhart. Our ability to do that and our willingness to do that does have limits and is subject to any other needs that the company may have, but we have exercised that discretion quite a bit over the last five months. If at anytime, Zions owns 95\u2026 over 90% of the commercial paper by Lockhart, Lockhart would dissolve and we would have to then repurchase all remaining securities from Lockhart and consolidate.", "But in summary, we can\u2019t arbitrarily just collapse it, bring it on to our balance sheet. But at anytime, market conditions or rating changes could bring additional Lockharts on to our balance sheet and we are prepared for that contingency, both from a capital and from a funding standpoint. That kind of concludes the review of the quarter.", "I would like to end prepared remarks by giving you guidance for the next few quarters of 2008. It\u2019s a difficult year for me to do that. It\u2019s clearly got to be a difficult year for you analysts and investors because each of you has to make numerous assumptions about what you think the environment and the economy will bring. We\u2019ll try to give you reasonably clear picture of where we stand today and we will try to give you our crystal ball outlook on some of the key drivers as we always do, but I do hasten to add, we not in the business of economic forecasting and we\u2019re subject to the same uncertainties about just what the economy does over the next few quarters as you are. Our job is to try to manage the business in a way that navigate through the successful under any of a wide variety of scenarios that may unfold from here.", "Loan growth, loan demand remains very strong out there across much our footprint, not in the southwestern states, but in a lot of other places. However, we do plan to proactively manage balance sheet growth and to hold total loan growth and total asset growth to be less than $1 billion in the first quarter. With the sluggish deposit growth, the expensive funding, and the very, very expensive capital out there we are going to restrain balance sheet growth back to where it was kind of in the middle of last year, second, third quarter averages, not the 1.5 growth that you saw in the fourth quarter. We think loan growth will continue to come from the commercial loan portfolio more than the CRE portfolio. It will be concentrated in Texas, Utah, and Colorado, and be relatively flat or declining in California, Arizona, and Nevada. And as I mentioned previously, we would expect residential construction and land development balances in the aggregate to trend downward, although in some markets they may continue to grow. Texas might be an example.", "Deposit growth, very hard to forecast, but it is not impossible to think that in a slowing economy and sharply lower market interest rate environment over the next few quarters may improve both deposit pricing and balances. Historically, that's what happened when the economy slowed, at least in the case of our balance sheet, and we would suspect that it might happen again, but the timing of that is as uncertain as the actual direction of the economy at this point.", "With regard to the margin, loan growth in excess of deposit growth coupled with a continued comparative deposited environment is likely to keep some pressure on the margin in the near feature. In addition, the purchase of the securities from Lockhart near year-end and continued purchases of its commercial paper will probably reduce the margin this quarter by another 6 basis points or more, all by itself. And as always, the behavior of DBA balances will remain a significant factor in the margin. We did see some improvement in the net interest spread in December, but particularly with the vary rapid Fed rate declines, it\u2019s probable that the margin will compress in the near term before the loan pricing and deposit pricing sort themselves out. We would expect that that may begin to have a positive impact on the margin at some point later in the year.", "Credit quality, we are at a point in a cycle where it is very difficult to predict future credit quality. Out best outlook is that conditions will continue to soften and home prices will continue to decline somewhat over the next few quarters. But the deterioration may not be as rapid as we saw in some markets during the last couple of quarter. At this point, we believe that while non-performing assets and net charge-offs will continue to be at or above their current levels for the next few quarters, the provision could remain relatively flat, somewhere around the last quarter and this quarter average, perhaps plus or minus.", "Reports from our executives in our various banks indicate that while some borrowers are clearly becoming more pressured, the loss content in our portfolio including the residential land construction and development portfolio remains relatively moderate. We expect the general economic conditions are likely to slow somewhat in the Intermountain West and in Texas, but that those state will continue to perform better than most of the country. And the one caveat on all of this that\u2019s unknown to us is everybody else is... widespread weakening in the economy more than currently being forecast, it was broadbased throughout our footprint, could result in weaker credit and higher credit cost. But most economic indicators today remain relatively strong in the majority of our markets when compared to the other areas of the country. In the end each of you will have to make your own assumptions about the direction of the economy, but we believe that we are positioned to outperform the industry and most of the likely scenarios.", "Efficiency ratio, we expect that adjusted for any unusual writedowns, if there are any, that we would\u2026 that the core efficiency ratio will remain pretty stable over the next year. As we\u2026 you build your models for 2008, we remind that FDIC expense will increase. During the fourth quarter, it increased $2.6 million. Our best estimate is that they will add about an additional $11.5 million pretax of expense in 2008 or $7 million after-tax. Further more, salary and benefit expense in the first quarter could be about $25 million higher than the fourth quarter. The reversal of the bonus and incentive plan accruals in the fourth quarter that I mentioned accounted for about\u2026 would account for $14 million of that change, i.e., we won't be reversing those again in the first quarter. So that's a snapback of $14 million compared to the third. And the remainder is primarily due to the normal increase in payroll taxes and 401(k) contributions that always happens in the first quarter. We expect to keep base salaries under good control. As I mentioned, your tax rate assumption should be similar to the rate used in prior quarters and ignore the fourth quarter tax rate.", "Finally, a comment about capital, we plan to maintain strong capital ratios and to limit share repurchases as a matter of balance sheet prudence in what is still an uncertain environment. We do expect to go to the debt markets for some types of funding this year, senior debts, sub-debt, depending upon the market in moderate amounts and with a lot of discretion about when we do that depending upon how the market is performing. Note that aside from the impairment and valuation charges, the fundamental earnings power of the company remains very strong even at current provision levels, which are substantially higher than they were a year ago. So we do not see a need to raise any form of common equity capital including convertible issues at this time. I will note that our 2006 DRD preferred stock issue was uniquely designed so that it could be re-opened. Depending on market conditions and needs we may consider auctioning additional amounts of that instrument in 2008. Not a new issue, just re-opening an old issue and offering it for sale at current spreads.", "So, in conclusion, the quarter was marked by the impact of the turbulent financial markets, particularly with regard to securities writedowns. Some decrease in credit quality driven largely by land and residential construction development activity, again in Arizona, Nevada, California. Strong loan growth in other geographies, but continued weak\u2026 cheap deposit growth and well controlled expenses. Credit quality, while it has softened, remains very manageable and we continue to see revenue growth in many of our markets.", "Finally, I want to remind you that we will be hosting our biannual investor conference in Salt Lake City on February 14, Happy Valentines Day. We hope that you can join us in Salt Lake, I know that a number of you are. For those of you can\u2019t, it will be webcast and we will try and address whatever is on anybody's mind at that event. We will have essentially the whole executive management team including all of the Bank CEOs present and many of them will be speaking.", "With that, I will close, and we will be happy to address your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos, with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Hi, everyone.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello, Steve.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "In terms of the comment to limit loan growth to $1 billion, it\u2019s about a third of reduction where we were this quarter. Can you walk us through how you plan to restrict growth? Is it just make pricing less attractive, tighten approvals, how are you thinking about that?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "We\u2019ve had a number of discussions with our bank executive teams explaining to them how expensive capital is these days. Basically saying, if you grow too fast we are going to charge you for it, we are going to\u2026 we\u2019ve developed other internal incentives to make sure that we are taking adequate account of the current spreads in the marketplace and loan pricing in terms of the incentives we are giving to them. And I\u2019ll just say, we already have evidence that it\u2019s beginning to take effect. We see\u2026 we\u2019ve gone from discussing the matter at considerable length and frequently internally over the last six month to actually putting in the case a number of sort of internal pricing mechanisms to we hope give the right incentives there, and we think we will be successful. We don't want to shut it off. We don't intend to shut it off. We just want to make sure that we are continuing to underwrite very high quality credits, only high quality credits, and get paid accordingly. And then we turn away the easier stuff, if you will.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Can you talk about the environment for funding Lockhart earlier in the first quarter, maybe an outlook on for Lockhart for '08?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say it is pretty difficult. The ABCP market continues to contract the spreads over LIBOR\u2026 of course, LIBOR itself has come down. As you know, the spread of LIBOR over\u2026 relative to Fed funds rates or other things has improved over the last few weeks. Spreads over LIBOR had come down somewhat as well. They are still much wider than historical, probably 30 basis points, 40 basis points wider to LIBOR and LIBOR itself is still somewhat wider. But the funding availability shows no signs of loosening up. It\u2019s still very, very tight out there. And there is a reasonable possibility that that will eventuality trigger a decision to buy additional assets in lieu\u2026 out of Lockhart in lieu of little of buying commercial paper from Lockhart.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "And just one final question, at this point have you gone through all the bank, the re-review the residential construction book?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me see, how many times, how do I tell--. Yes, we have\u2026 I think all the banks probably went through the bulk of their major points of concern in their portfolios, particularly those in the southwest, a couple of times even just during the third quarter\u2026 fourth quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "As of regulator, certainly.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of James Abbott with Friedman, Billings, and Ramsey. Please proceed.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, James", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Hi, good evening, a couple of questions. One on the C&I loan growth, I was wondering if you could give us a little color on the geographic region? I guess you did give from general guidelines, but if it was heavily concentrated in Texas maybe. I'm also interested in the utilization rates, are people\u2026 are these new relationships or are these existing relationships trying further on lines of credit?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Second question\u2026 answer to the second question first. No, we have seen no meaningful change in line utilization rates. On average across all types of loans, they kind of continue to be in the 40%, plus or minus a few percentage points range, and it's been within that range for quite some time. So we don't see run-ups in utilization reach indicating kind of stress borrowing if you will. So most of the increase represents draws on new credits, new fundings, and yes, it is\u2026 probably Texas has been the biggest single dollar source followed by the Utah Bank followed by the Colorado followed by the State\u2026 the Washington bank.", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Okay, and as far as the underwriting on commercial business credits, what changes have been made to that over the past, say, six months, just to kind of give us a perspective as to how you are shifting things around?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "No changes. We didn\u2019t loosen the standards when things were easy and we haven't tightened them now. I guess the major change would be they were encouraged real pricing discipline, make sure we are being compensated for the credit extend rather than dramatically changing the actual underwriting criteria.", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Okay. And last question on the construction delinquencies, are you seeing any trend at all to suggest that commercial construction is beginning to weaken? We've seen some articles, The Wall Street Journal and properties in Las Vegas and stuff like that going back. What\u2019s your sense there? Are you seeing any trends?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Only very slightly, nothing major\u2026 kind of I will make a comment and Jerry or Harris can jump in or refute me, but the stresses you are hearing about, some of them are related to trophy kinds of properties, very high-end properties are having trouble of getting takeout financing or refinancing or things like that, very large projects. Our commercial activity is more concentrated in middle\u2026 for lack of a better word, middle market type credits, not big trophy office buildings or casinos. And so we are not seeing some of the stresses that you are hearing about.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think you are right on target with that comment.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Okay. Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Manuel Ramirez with KVW. Please proceed.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Manny.", "Manuel Ramirez - Keefe Bruyette & Woods", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. On credit, I was wondering if you could give some general comments on kind of what indicators you're looking out to get this your visibility for yourself on where credit is going? I would wholeheartedly agree that this is about as tough as it\u2019s ever been to figure out where the economy of credits going. So I\u2019d just like to hear your perspective on kind of the last few months, on what to look for, and what you're focusing on going forward to that?", "And then on the $70 million [ph] provision this quarter, roughly what amount of that was attributable to sort of additional deterioration of residential construction versus all the other factors you are doing without?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "This is Harris. Let me talk a little bit about credit further and then Jerry might have some comments as well. I think that\u2026 I mean one of the things that we do is every other month as a management team we go through quite a lot of granular detail, every deal that is criticized or classified of any size at all. And yes, there\u2019s a pretty good feel for not only in the aggregate but what is going on at the very micro level with a lot of these credits. And I think that what we're seeing is, we are continuing to see a lot of weakness in land values. And so as we look at the residential construction book, A&D portfolio, the greatest strains are in the development round in that the A&D portfolio where you have land or undeveloped lots or even developed lots, or you\u2019ve had lot of builders who have bailed out, they\u2019ve locked on options, etcetera, and that\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s just clearly a lack of demand for land at reasonable prices today, reasonable at least relative to what we have seen six months ago. We know there's a lot of money out there waiting for a bottom to be there and at the end of the day we think there will be a market for that land, but we don't think we have seen the bottom of it yet. So we are still watching, but we are getting\u2026 continue to get new appraisals process\u2026 a process that has been going on really now for\u2026 that is always going on, but a bit more\u2026 in a more accelerated fashion since kind of the beginning of September.", "Manuel Ramirez - Keefe Bruyette & Woods", "Maybe you can get Fannie Mae to start buying [inaudible] securities?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's a great idea. But I think that\u2026 so with respect to that portfolio, I mean we are taking quite a granular look through it at a very senior level.", "With respect to other parts of the portfolio, I mean obviously we have an ongoing credit exam process internally that is looking for problems. But as I indicated earlier, so far we are just not seeing any real demonstrable issues in the C&I or the consumer portfolios or for that matter in the non-residential commercial real estate portfolio of any real magnitude at all. It tends\u2026 it does appear to us at this stage to be reasonably isolated. So I think that the risk of recession I think is quite high and I do expect we\u2019ll see more fraying in other areas as this proceeds. But I also think that we are coming into it reasonably strong.", "Manuel Ramirez - Keefe Bruyette & Woods", "Okay.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Gerry, anything you\u2019d--?", "Gerald J. Dent - Executive Vice President, Credit Administration", "This is Gerry Dent, for the transcriber, speaking now. Thank you. The review that Harris was referring to is basically at an executive level, and as he\u2019d pointed that\u2019s a fair amount of detail. But I would also point out that in addition to looking at\u2026 as far as the management of their own portfolios in each of our institutions, in addition to looking at our problem credits, we are on a regular basis going through the rest of the portfolio, not only the\u2026 primarily focused on the residential market, but also the other aspects of commercial real estate construction. When we started end of the process, our concern was primarily with respect to the residential land and other types of land loans, and obviously that's where the first weakening started and that's where the biggest concern has been. We're watching other areas of the portfolio. We are watching closely the retail segment as well as the office and industrial type properties. So we're trying to stay on top of them.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You asked about the provision and how much of that is attributable to residential, and I don\u2019t know if we have the exact number.", "Manuel Ramirez - Keefe Bruyette & Woods", "A ballpark obviously--.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It\u2019d be\u2026 the bulk of the increase would be because of that. It's also driven obviously just by loan growth, but our\u2026 in turn we have basically a range from low to high that we try to remain with them. We have been determined to try and make sure that we are not sagging in that range as problems develop, but most of it would be attributable to residential.", "Manuel Ramirez - Keefe Bruyette & Woods", "Okay.", "Gerald J. Dent - Executive Vice President, Credit Administration", "Let\u2019s say close to two-thirds of the provision is accounting for increases to [inaudible].", "Manuel Ramirez - Keefe Bruyette & Woods", "And then your charge-offs this quarter\u2026 I'm sorry the composition?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "The largest portion of that would also be related to residential land acquisition and development coming out of California and Arizona and Nevada.", "Manuel Ramirez - Keefe Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line Todd Hagerman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Good afternoon, everybody.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Doyle, I just want to go back to the reserve for just a minute. I'm just trying to get a better sense of the adequacy, the $459 million is essentially as you referenced before, loan loss content at this stage of the game, comfortable LTVs for the most part, thorough updated appraisals and so forth. I'm trying to get a better sense of what you guys are doing in terms of\u2026 in general with the risk migration within the portfolio, how much generally you are allocating towards the problem with residential construction portfolio? Or maybe a better way to say it is what is kind of the average kind of write down that you guys are taking in the charge-offs that we have seen in the last couple of quarters? Could you kind of give us a sense of how much cushion you\u2019ve kind of built in to this portfolio at this stage of the game?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Jerry, Danne\u2019s is going to take the first crack and then I may\u2026 at an answer, then I may chime in.", "Danne L. Buchanan - Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of NetDeposit", "The majority of the charge-offs that we've had on commercial real estate loans have been really quite small percentage-wise, I would say around 5% to 10% at the most. The extreme example I would give you is we have had one credit during this quarter on which we had a 25% write-down on it, but that's a singular credit and it\u2019s the worst of the whole group.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Can you give us, Jerry... that's helpful. I mean could you give us a sense, I mean going in when you initially established a reserve or make an allocation against one of these credits, just generally speaking say it\u2019s a substandard credit, how much is generally already reserved on one of these typical credits going into this process with the incremental write-down?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "You mean, if it's downgraded from something to substandard, how much more is put away at that time?", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Right, I mean you\u2019ve got the 5% to 10% average write-down on top of an X percent of reserves that has been allocated against that credit.", "Gerald J. Dent - Executive Vice President, Credit Administration", "The additional reserve would be set aside and the most substandard would be approximately 10%.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Okay.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Of the loan balance. So every loan has some reserve applied to it no matter how good, but the change from a pass rated credit to substandard is about an incremental 10% on an average. It could be a little more, it could be a little less. And then you look at\u2026 and particularly in the real estate area, you are clearly looking in the collateral values, you are going to go get a reappraisal of the property, see what 's your loan balance is against\u2026 compared to the appraised amount. If your loan balance exceeds the values of collateral, you are going to charge it down. You are still going to have a reserve on the rest. So the charge-offs generally are essentially coming from when the collateral value has declined such that it's less than what would fully support the loan balance you are charging off the balance, that\u2019 what\u2019s driving a fair amount of the charge-offs.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. In noting that, kind of in this first round anyway, the\u2026 as we\u2019ve said before, we came into this cycle with pretty strong equity and deals, and so far that equity has precluded larger charge-downs, and you might have seen it in prior cycles. Clearly, if this gets a lot deeper and goes on longer, that could increase the size of the pretty write downs there were taken on these-.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Just to quantify what Harris just said, this is Doyle again, let me remind you that as we have discussed a number of times and disclosed in these eye-popping charts that we sometimes disclaim, our standard maximum loan-to-value ratio on just raw land unless there is some other strong source of support was no more than 50%, meaning there is $1 of equity in the deal for every dollar of land value.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "That's very helpful. I appreciate the color.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "[inaudible] land value, excuse me. We are lending a dollar and there is a dollar out there.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Maybe we should have done a dollar for dollar.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I would have.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Terrific. Thanks a lot.", "Doyle L.

Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Ken.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Two questions. First of all, just on credit, Doyle, to your point of run rate provisions being somewhere between third and fourth, call that in the low-60s, whatever, I just want to understand a little bit between what you expect to be providing versus what you expect to be charging off. So as you move ahead here and given all the comments you have already made about loss content, will we see more of a tighter band between provisions and charge-offs or would you still expect to also be adding towards\u2026 adding to the reserves due to the migration trends and etcetera?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right now, we don't see a sharp increase in charge-offs. I don\u2019t seen them declining, but I don't see reason that they are going to sharply increase. So somewhere in the 20s for lack of a better guess on the charge-offs, and so yes\u2026 but we do expect to continue to provision well on excess of charge-offs for a while as we see where the economic cycle does unfold. So embedded in that were some of the years a fair amount of reserve strengthening.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. That's helpful to understand. And then my second question is just on the margin, I just want to make sure I heard you right, Doyle. Can you walk us back again through what of the margin negatives from this quarter are already in the run rate? And then what are the incremental builds that impact the margin going forward?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "What was in this quarter's run rate were three items and then from biggest to smallest they were, very strong loan growth funded almost entirely with relatively expensive sources of funding, in particular DDA did not come close to keeping pace with the run rate. So the averaging back and to the existing portfolio diminished the overall margin by 8 basis points. If we had no loan growth and no change, there would be no change in funding mix in the next quarter. There would be no change in margin from where it was. But to the extent there is further loan growth and it\u2019s funded with market rates sources, not cheap sources, that will\u2026 all else being equal that will compress the margin. I have already suggested to you that we are going to try to hold loan growth to at least a third less than it was. So the impact probably shouldn't be quite as strong.", "The next biggest was Lockhart Funding. The average amount of assets on the quarter had an impact of 6 basis points on the margin, but a lot of those assets came on at the end of the quarter. The fact that they are there for the whole quarter means the margins will start out at 6 basis points lower still this quarter, simply because we had\u2026 we go in to the quarter with far more than what we averaged in the way of Lockhart assets last quarter. If we buy more, there will be a further depressing effect. I mean so it is probably\u2026 it is 6 to maybe 12 basis points. That doesn't mean we are not earning a positive spread on those assets, but it does mean that the margin diminishes and a few basis points were just due to pricing pressures. And now, kind of the wild card is what does the\u2026 what is in this quarter in my view is\u2026 kind of when the Fed is moving deposit rates 75 basis points off cycle and maybe another 50 on cycle, clearly in response to liquidity crisis and everybody scrambling for funding, loan pricing we adjust immediately or very quickly because a lot of our loans are prime and LIBOR-based as you all know.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "We\u2019ve hedged a lot of that, but not to the degree at which the rates are moving in this very abnormal environment. What we don't know is when and how quickly and how much the deposit pricing will finally start to break. I've got to believe that it will at some point and it will significantly, but the near-term effect could be some compression there. And that I wouldn\u2019t even try to quantify at this time because I just don't know.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Right. Okay, great. That is really helpful. Thank you.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "There are no more questions queued up, but we will pause here. If anyone has one, now is your chance or save them up to February 14 or some of you I\u2019ll be seeing next week at an IR conference in New York and we look forward to more of you. Anybody else right now?", "Operator", "And your next question\u2026 no, there are no questions in queue at this time.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Then I guess I will wrap it up. Again, I would say thank you for your attention. It's clearly very interesting times. As always we\u2019ve tried to be as candid as we can, tell you what we know and what we don't know. You know that the interesting thing is there are still a lot of positives out there in a very tumultuous environment. We\u2019ll look forward to chatting with you in the coming weeks. With that I guess we will sign off.", "Operator", "Thank you for your attendance in today's presentation. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

My name is Emisia, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions].", "I will now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call Mr. Clark Hinckley, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.", "Clark Hinckley - Director of Investor Relations", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for this quarterly conference call on April 17, 2008. During this call we will reference several pages from our earnings press release, if you do not have a copy of the earnings release you can download it from our website in PDF format at www.zionsbanccorporation.com. A link to the release is near the top of the page.", "During today's call, we will discuss the expected performance of the company.

Actual results may differ materially from the projections provided in this call since such projections involve significant risks and uncertainties. A complete disclaimer is included in the press release and is incorporated into this call. We are not responsible for transcripts of this call made by independent third parties.", "I will now turn the time over to our Chairman and CEO, Harris Simmons. Harris?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much Clark, and we welcome all of you to our call this afternoon. You have seen we had earnings of $0.98 for fully diluted shares, which was about 27.9% decrease from the first quarter of last year, that it is in environment that remains challenging.", "The... there is nonetheless lot of good news, I think underlying some of these numbers, the... as Doyle will talk about in lot of detail. We have the much larger provision... $92.3 million provision this year which was up over 900% over last year's... first quarter of last year. And some continued impairment and valuation losses on securities of $46.0 million.", "If you look under the core performance however, there are couple of very interesting stories to tell. We have really a tale of two different sets of banks here. We have some banks that are experiencing some real challenges down in the Southwestern United States in Arizona, Nevada and California. Where loan growth has been flat actually slightly down over the past year, as deposit growth revenues were actually half about 7% versus last year, and net income is down 44.3%.", "But if you look at the bulk of the franchise in Utah, Texas, Colorado, West and the Pacific Northwest, pre-tax... preprovision income is actually up 38.5% and even if you exclude this Visa related gains this quarter up over 25% against last year. We have very strong loan growth, good expense control, etcetera. So the quarter of the franchise remains very healthy and that combined with continuing stable margin gives us a lot to be reasonably sanguine about. I am going to ask Doyle to go through this in detail and we will answer any questions you have on the other end.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, everybody. As Harris indicated my walk through the numbers will be somewhat lengthy, I want to try to anticipate a number of questions and cover them for everyone benefits as we go along. So bare with me and we will stick around for all the questions that you have that we'll give answer afterwards.", "As Harris said earnings per share for the quarter were $0.98 fully diluted, which is up shortly from last quarter, but as he indicated down from the same quarter a year ago. The $0.98 did include $0.27 of drag related to impairment and valuation losses on securities, and benefited about $0.10 per diluted share from our portion of the Visa IPO gain and reversal of some of the litigation accruals related to Visa that we made in the fourth quarter.", "Highlights of the major components are... as we indicated last quarter we were going to try to manage loan growth down from the $1.5 billion gross level in the fourth quarter. We said that we keep it under $1 billion, probably between $700 million and $1 billion for this quarter. Our actual growth was $821 million which consisted of a little over $500 million of organic growth and $283 million of securitize loans that were purchased from Lockhart during the quarter. The whole point of constraining the loan growth was to manage the balance sheet stress and the capital stress associated with growth, and to make sure that we had plenty of room to accommodate anything that we had to do with regard to Lockhart, and we think we achieved what we wanted to there.", "Our core deposit growth remains different with difficult, but we did see average core deposit growth of about $300 million during the quarter and consistent with Harris as said tale of two banks that was growth in some places and not in others. The largest count type components were in Internet and in money market accounts. The net interest margin was a bit better than we had expected. It was at 4.23%. It was down only 4 basis points from the last quarter, and if you would simply factor in the additional Lockhart related or Lockhart issued commercial paper purchased by our banks during the quarter, i.e., the increase in the first quarter versus fourth quarter of last year that alone had a five basis point drag on the margin. So the core margin if you will actually strengthened by about 1 basis point.", "We are seeing somewhat better marginal loan spreads that is spreads on newly originated or renewed loans during the quarter, and we did see some greater responsiveness of deposit rates to fed rate cuts during the quarter. Credit particularly residential land and construction loans are continued to weaken during the quarter. It didn't surprise us. I don't think it surprises you. The magnitude, the deterioration in some markets was a little bit higher than we expected and therefore the provision as we continued to build reserves was a little bit higher than our guidance form last quarter.", "Non-performing assets increased to $150 million to $434 million during the quarter. Net charge-offs were just shy of $51 million in the provision was $92.3 million, which is $41.5 million in excess of charge-offs and we continue to build the ratio of allowances and reserves for credit losses in relation to total loans, and we will go through those numbers later.", "Two non-operating items, impacted net earnings as I mentioned. We did recognize $46 million pre-tax or $0.27 per diluted share of impairment and valuation losses on securities. Most of this was related to the REIT CDOs that we discussed last time and the rest was related to securities purchased from Lockhart.", "We also recognized a net VISA IPO gain, at litigation accrual reversals of $18 million, pre-tax or $0.10 per diluted share. The pre-tax gain component of that was $12.4 million which represented about 39% of our banks equity interest in Visa. So we have about $21 million of additional unrealized Visa related, which per SEC guidance are not recorded anywhere, and will not be recognized unless and until the lock up of those shares is removes us, I think it's three years out in the future.", "Of the $8.1 million of litigation reserve that we recognized in the fourth quarter, we reversed $5.6 million of that, in this quarter, again related to the IPO, and Visa assumption of those obligations, and so the net swing in that expense line is $13.7 million I'll point that out later. The efficiency ratio if you adjusted just to exclude the impact of the impairment and valuation losses, as well as the Visa related pick-up was 55.8% essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter.", "In summary, loan growth was well managed. The net interest spread improve significantly. The net interest margin was stable. Operating costs were well controlled. The capital ratio was actually improved slightly. Credit costs increased largely driven by the weakness in residential acquisition development and construction in the Southwest, and we did take action... continued action to build reserves.", "The 60% of the franchise located outside the three Southwestern States performed very well. Our some economic slowing is beginning to be evident in some of those markets as well. And the net earnings were also adversely impacted by the additional securities related losses although significantly lesser levels than in the fourth quarter.", "Okay, turning page by page to a few other details, and I apologize from the tickle in my throat, so try to get through this without too much coughing. If you want to turn with me the page 11 our financial highlights, page numbers in the upper left. Last two lines on the page we've already cover this, but just to point out, the actual efficiency margin for the quarter was 58% adjusted for those two items I mentioned it was 55.8. The comparable numbers last quarter were 75.9 and then 55.3 respectively, again if you just adjust for those similar items.", "So essentially for number of quarters now the efficiency ratios has been in the 55% to 56% range and very stable. Net interest margin 4.23% down 4 basis points. We think still trending downward a bit, but perhaps a little bit slower rate and what we are seeing for the prior few quarters.", "Turning to page 12, near the bottom of the page in that very last section the fourth line up from the bottom tangible equity ratio 6.20% that's up 3 basis points from the prior quarter it still a little bit below the range of 6 in the quarter to 6.5% that is out long-term target, but we are pleased that there was no additional deterioration on that number, and in fact it improved a bit and the improvement came in spite of close to $200 million of marks... fair value marks taken through other comprehensive income on the rest of the securities portfolio during the quarter.", "So we had $200 million pre-tax drag there and still improve the capital ratio with the balance sheet management that we've talked about earlier, and note that the dividend payout ratio even at a somewhat lower level of earnings and were custom to was at 44% this quarter. So we retain 56% of earnings again to build capital, and as you know there were no share buybacks during the quarter.", "Turning to the consolidated balance sheet on page 13, first I'll note the second line of numbers from the top interest bearing deposits in commercial paper increased $518 million that reflects the increased level of purchases of lock of commercial paper issued by Lockhart and purchased by our various banks during the quarter. The average on the day-to-day basis now the Lockhart related paper that we have on our balance sheet is running around $1.2 billion, kind of 1.15 to 1.25 depending upon the day and it's been fairly stable at that point for at least couple of three weeks at this point.", "The next line I'll call your attention to is four lines below that the available for sale securities at fair value decreased $875 million. We sold $260 million of securities during the quarter for a smaller gain just about $1 million, I mean very small. The AFS balance was also reduced by the impairment charges, and this is fair value of $56 million. It was further reduced by the increase in the mark to the fair value of those securities as that were reflected in OCI of about $200 million and they were partially offset, these reductions were partially offset by purchase of securities from Lockhart funding with a fair value of about $75 million.", "During the quarter our three additional securities were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, these were REIT CDO securities, and impairment charge of $33 million was recognized on these securities. Most of this loss have been previously recognized in OCI, but not through the income statement. So for those there was not a big impact on capital took at that of OCI ran through the income statement.", "As you recall at the end of the last quarter we had 12 REIT CDOs that we've discussed with an original face value of about $231 million. Eight of these securities had been deemed OTTI in the first quarter... fourth quarter, excuse me, and were carried at a fair value of $33 million at year end. Further impairment of $7.8 million was recognized on seven of these securities in the first quarter.", "Two more of the original 12 were deemed OTTI in the first quarter and we adopt fair value accounting FAS 159 on a third. So at this point should all 12 of these CDOs become worthless, which we don't expect, the maximum impact on our income would be $58 million pre-tax, that's the amount of fair value... remaining fair value in those securities that has not been run through our income statement. A portion of that 58 is already reflected in OCI, so the affect on capital would be less than that and of course those are pre-tax numbers, they were also be tax affected.", "Going out onto gross loans, $40 billion at the end of the quarter compared to 39.25 prior quarter, so our gross basis were up $812 million, $283 million of that increase resulted from the purchase of Lockhart securities that were essentially securitize loans that we had originally... whether we had original created the securities. When they came back on our balance sheet in effect the securities were unwrapped and they come back on our balance sheet as loans. If you net out the $283 million you had I think $529 million of organic loan growth during the quarter.", "Net all that out together and you get $461 million of total asset growth. Going down to the liability section, non-interest bearing DDA, decline from $9.6 billion to $9.5 billion during the quarter on an average basis there declines was a bit more than that, and you can see a couple lines down then money market and Internet money markets accounts grow. I will also just point it out the other two big changes there are federal funds purchased went down, 650 odd million, actually 647 and that was offset by increased Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings of $708 million. We have remaining borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank and institute the various fed facilities in excess of $11 billion, so bank liquidity is not a particular issue.", "Turning to page 14, as noted earlier we had loan growth, balance sheet growth, and we had reasonably stable margin the result of which was a slight increase in net interest income before provision of about $8 million. The non-interest income section we have made a couple of changes in the presentation this quarter, after adopting FAS 159 just make it a little bit clear where the parts are. We have added a line... created a line called capital markets and foreign exchange. These are kind of real businesses if you will, and then we have carved those out of other service commissions and fees and then we have a line called... let me find it here, fair value and non hedged derivative income. This is where we are taking all of the... we put the four FAS 159 securities that we described in the 10-K at the end of the year and as well as continuing to book the non hedge derivative income or loss there.", "Talking about some particulars lines. Loan sales and servicing no longer will include any impairment charges or adjustments on value on retained interest as we adopted and previously disclosed the adoption of FAS 159 on these retained interest, there are three of them. So they are now going through that fair value line and as a reminder, the fourth quarter number on the loan sales and servicing income did include the $3.3 million impairment charge. We have done no securitizations of small business loans for over two years now and don't expect to in the future and therefore we do expect that line will continue to slowly decline as existing and amortize or as previously securitized loans may be purchased from Lockhart and come back on the balance sheet as loans.", "The income from the securities conduit was up slightly in the fourth quarter in spite of reductions. This increase was partly explained by improved spread and Lockhart Funding. I'll talk a bit more about Lockhart in a bit. Fair value non hedged derivative income loss in puts fair value adjustments resulting from the company's adoption of FAS 159 as well as non hedged derivative income that was previously included in trading and non hedged derivative.", "You can see the fluctuations in this line. The losses in the prior two quarters were primarily due to the prime LIBOR spread abnormalities that we previously discussed and there is some of that came back not to normal, but there was some improvement [audio interruption] And then the next line equity securities gains includes, as mentioned $12.4 million of these IPO gain offset by a couple of small losses. And then finally the next and the last line in that section you can see the $46 million of impairment losses which is $112 million improvement over the prior quarter. For those who want the details, I'll go through it. There are four components of the $46 million. On the securities purchased for Lockhart... from Lockhart for liquidity reasons; of which there were not 275 million. The fair value mark on that was $4.4 million pretax. We purchased one additional security of $5 million from Lockhart as a result of a downgrade below AA minus. The mark on that security was $0.8 million. The fair value mark on the two reach CDOs and one other small CDO held in the FAS deem during the quarter DOTTI was $33 million and then fair value marks additional write downs on seven of the eight CDOs previously deemed were $7.8 million. Total is $46 million.", "Non-interest expense, I'm only going to comment about two lines specifically salary and employee benefit expense increased about $18 million quarter-over-quarter, but recall in the fourth quarter we mentioned that we have reversed about $13 million of accruals for various incentive and bonus plans due to the poor... weaker performance of the year. So the fourth quarter impressible [ph] run rate by that reversal, two times the first quarter of each year is always a bit higher due to the fact that all employees are back paying... repaying FICO and all of that those kinds of things on all employees again until people hit their various limits on payroll taxes and you could see if you go back a year from the first quarter of last year there was a decline of $7 million in that line item mostly due to payroll taxes.", "Other non-interest expense the last line in that section declined in almost all of that decline is reflects the Visa litigation accruals, we accrued $8.8 million... $8.1 million in the fourth quarter. So that number was higher than normal and then we reversed $5.6 million of it this quarter, so the net swing was $13.7 million, quarter-on-quarter and the rest of the line items are particularly kind of normal.", "I will talk about the unfunded lending commitment line next of last line a bit later. Okay, let's see. I will just mention on page 15, with a page I don't know normally call out this is changes in... this is basically other comprehensive income. If you look in the third column from the right, the third number down net realized and unrealized holding losses on investment leading interest $130 million that's the after tax impact on capital of the roughly $200 million pretax number. The fair value march through OCI on securities that I mentioned earlier.", "Turning to page 16 credit quality, there was continued deterioration in credit quality, non-performing assets increased by about $150 million to 1.09% of net loans and leases. As you might expect the increase was concentrated in Nevada, Arizona followed by Colorado and those three states are the... probably two-thirds to three quarters maybe more like three quarters of the increase are coming out of those states and it's mostly again residential land acquisition development and lot loans related.", "Accruing loans past 90 days also saw a slight increase. Net charge-offs was 50.8 million or 0.52% of annualized average loan again driven mostly by declining collateral values on residential acquisition development construction loans in the south... in the south west and while it is high for us historically I will point out that 0.52% is below the fourth quarter average of all banks over $10 billion what was 0.67%. So while were we are watching this closely, I know there are issues with we think on a relative basis our performance is still reflects our strong underwriting ethic and in culture around here.", "In this uncertain environment, we still continue to build reserves. The provision for losses was $92.3 million and exceeded net charge-offs by $41.5 million and you can see we also provided... pre-tax [indiscernible] million of additional reserve for unfunded lending commitments and bringing the ratio... the total ratio... ratio of the total allowance and reserve credit losses to 1.32% which is up another 9 basis point. The prior quarter and we do expect to continue to cut that ratio will continue to increase for at least few more quarters.", "The couple more comments on loan quality trans residential ADC loans in this California, Arizona and Nevada remain the most troubled segment of the portfolio. We do see some weakness in Utah and Idaho as a housing market there has slowed. We've have seen an up tick in commercial and industrial loan delinquencies although they're still not as high as they were as recently as 2003. We looked there doesn't appear to be any particularly geography, or sick code concentration in those delinquencies, but they are drifting upward. Within the consumer portfolio, home equity credit lines, home equity loans in credit card delinquencies have remained very low and stable. In fact home equity credit line delinquencies are actually less, may decrease slightly from new already very low levels at year end.", "And the only noticeable up tick in consumer delinquency issues again, as I mentioned is related to consumer lot loans primarily and Arizona, which is about a $465 million portfolio and it's clearly related to the overall housing issues in that state. Page seventeen going to go through loans portfolio growth by type. You'll note in commercial lending group by commercial industrial loan by $200 million... $220 million is organic. The owner occupied line grew $365 million. Of that $213 million of that growth was related to the securitized loans repurchased from Lockhart leading 150 million of organic growth in that component. Construction and land development was relatively flat. Growth and Energy Bank of Texas was largely offset by declines in the south Western states, so the portfolios continue to be worked out and payoff. The Term Loans grew by $234 million, $63 million of that Lockhart related, i.e. loans repurchased from Lockhart, leaving $171 million of organic growth and then consumer loans declined slightly during the quarter.", "The Loan growth was concentrated primarily in Zion's Bank, Amegy Bank and Vectra Bank in Colorado, the Banks in the Pacific North west also grew very strongly on percentage terms but in dollar amounts contributed less to the totals, and then total loans at CB&T, California Bank & Trust that is was flat, and National Bank of Arizona and Nevada State Bank, showed over all declines in Loan balances.", "On page 18, I will just point out at the bottom of the page, the last 2 loans the net interest spread actually increased from 3.45 % to 3.61%, that reflects both the greater responsiveness of deposit rates to short term interest rate cuts as well as improved pricing on the newly originated or renewed loans. The margin declined only 4 basis points. The big difference between the two, a very strong improvement in the spread in the slight decline in the net interest margin is primarily due to the fact the DVA balances in a lower interest rate environment are less or contribute less to the margin then they do to a higher rate environment. So that explains the difference in the performance in the two numbers. But on a net basis we think we are roughly asset neutral at this point. Interest rate yeah the first asset sensitive liability senses and we think were approximately neutral for all intensive purposes and as I mentioned earlier the other... additional Lockhart commercial paper had a five basis point negative impact on a margin during the quarter.", "Just some brief summary about what happened with Lockhart during the quarter. At year end, Lockhart had $2.1 billion of total assets. At the end of quarter... the fair value that was $22 million less than book... book value. At the end of this quarter it had total assets of $1.75 billion, that's down $2.1 billion. In the fair value mark which is not recorded. It's just... we're disclosing what it is. It was $48.4 million. So fair value is $48.4 million less than the $1.75 billion of assets. The reason that mark is relatively small... I know you are probably used to seeing bigger marks is that 95% of these securities are rated AAA with by all the agencies rating number and 100% rated double layer higher by both rating agencies that rate them. So these are again very high quality assets. They include US governments and agencies around securities small business along AAA rated transits in AAA bank and insurance trust preffered pools make up the bulk of the portfolio. During the quarter one security owned by Lockhart was downgraded below double A minus by a rating agency and was purchased by Zions Bank under the terms of the liquidity agreement. The security as I said had a book value of $5 million, which was written down and booked by us at a fair value of $4.2 million and the 800,000 impairment loss ran through our income statement.", "In addition during the quarter we purchased, $275 million of securities from Lockhart due to the inability of Lockhart to issue a sufficient amount of commercial papers to fund its assets. Again they were purchased from Lockhart at book value, written down to a fair value of $270.6 million resulting in a pre tax loss of $4.4 million that went through our income statement. About $200 million of these were securities for small business loan securitizations created by Zion's bank and upon purchase the securitized trusts were dissolved and the assets including $83 million of related securities, retained by the parent, our parent company, Zion Bankcorp were recorded as loans on the balance sheet and Joe and as I mentioned at quarter end we held 1.23 billion of commercial paper issued by Lockhart which was included in money market investments in commercial on the companies balance sheet and that again that kind of 1.2 billion of number is sort of been a run rate here for the last few weeks.", "As we have noted in the past and just to remind you, Lockhart is a QSPE not a sale and we don't have discretionary control over this off balance sheet entity which means that we can't arbitrarily decide to dissolve it or anything like that. We follow the rules under of it's creation and the liquidity agreement, but I do want to know... want you to note that it should advance transpire that would result and bringing all the assets Lockhart on to our balance sheet. The net impact from our funding in capital prospective would be to add net, net approximately $520 million of assets to our balance sheet. That's the difference between the $1.75 billion of assets and Lockhart in the $1.2 billion of commercial paper issued by Lockhart that we are. So at $500 million would be have a relatively modest impact on our funding and capital.", "So that concludes my review of the quarter guidance for in the next few quarter it's a difficult and environment and wish to give you a guidance, but we will try to do the best we can the... this is subject to lot of uncertainty about of the future course of the economy.", "With regard to loan growth, we do... our plan to continue the proactively managed balance sheet growth over the next few quarters or being very selective on under writing and conservative on loan pricing and with the objective of keeping the long growth two are good, but manageable rate from our funding and capital and unless kind of perspectives. We think loan growth will continue to come more from the commercial portfolio than the CRE portfolio and will continue to be concentrated in Texas, the Mountain states in the Pacific Northwest with relatively flat or declining portfolios in California, Arizona, and Nevada, and we expect residential construction development balances to continue to decline in those states although it may be some of that decline, it may be offset by growth elsewhere. Deposit growth, we expect the slowing economy and sharply lower market interest rates, will over the next few quarters improve both deposit pricing and balances. This has been true in previous interest rate cycles, but the timing and the amount of this improvement is difficult to predict.", "If we turn to the margin, we think the general pressure is still downward, but we are encouraged by the fact that we are seeing some improvement and spreads on new loans and the market has become more responsive on deposit pricing to recent interest rate cuts. So, we think that best guess is it would be may be down to relatively stable over the short term, but could begin to improve a bit later in the year.", "Credit quality remains the number one issue for most of the industry as it is for us and during the first quarter we saw continued declines in residential land values and general softening of the economy. In many if not most of our geographies, we think conditions will likely continue to soften in the residential land and home prices will continue to decline somewhat over the next few quarters. But the deterioration may not be as rapid as we saw on some markets during the last couple of quarters.", "NPAs are likely to continue to increase, net charge-offs and provision are likely to remain near the levels experienced in this first quarter. We think general economic conditions are likely to slow in the normal west and Pacific Northwest perhaps even a bit in Texas, but we think these states will continue to perform better then most of the nation. And if there is widespread weakening further in the economy that could result in weaker recognitions and higher credit costs, but we again we think most economic indicators indicate our markets would perform better than the company as a whole... the nation as a whole. Thank you.", "And again, we have these kind of the tale of two banks, we've got about 40% of the franchise in California and Nevada and Arizona that are kind of continue to be stressed by the very hard hit residential markets. And 60% is in markets that are performing better than those banks are performing, better and we expect them to continue to generate relatively strong earnings.", "I think the efficiency ratio will be stable over the year, one with regard to the tax rate, tax rate has been affected the last couple of quarters by lot of special items. For those of you who go to the models, we think that over the course of this year our average number is slightly higher than the first quarter. We would suggest that you might want to look at a 33% to 33.5% average tax, effective tax rate as the number to years.", "We finally, our... we think our capital remains strong and stable. We plan to continue to actively manage the balance sheet to conserve capital and use it judiciously, fundamental earnings remain strong even the current provisions levels, we do not intent to repurchase stock in the near term and we will as I said, manage asset growth kind of within the confines of the capital base and so forth.", "We have successful capped the senior debt markets during the first quarter a couple of times of funding, you've probably seen our press releases to that effect. We issued our 67 million of senior debt back in February, another 66 then 87 this week. We do not seem CME raise any form of common capital including convertible, our dividend payout ratio has always been relatively modest and we don't anticipate a need to restrict our dividends.", "So in conclusion, the quarter was marked by additional reserve building in the face of increased charge-offs, driven mostly by decline in residential land values in Arizona and Nevada and California as it has been. An additional market related impairment cost on securities, managed loan growth, a stable margin, well controlled operating expenses and stable capital. With that, it's probably enough of a soliloquy, it's been a unusually long one, I thank you for your patience and we will be happy to try to address your questions. Hello, is anybody there?", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Steven Alexopoulos with J.P. Morgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "Hi everyone.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi Steve.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "I am curious, we have had a couple of quarters now where provision expense was above the upper end of the expectations and I know if you guys probably seen this for most thing. Would the decline in home prices now in your expectations, what really needs to happen for us to get to the point where you provide it for the bulk of problems and we start to see provision levels start to come down?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "I think at this point, it's hard to call that turn still because we are still seeing declines in home starts and home permits, but at the lower level... lower rate of decline. So we are still seeing, we are still seeing... for us it's not so much home prices as it is just stress on home builders and developers. And until you hit a stable bottom I think in the level of starts, and have a full adjustment to that level in that part of their operating expense, we may continue to see a bias upward in some of these stresses. We are... we may be at some micro markets around our territory we may have already provided the bulk of what we are going to need to provide, but not to have the whole at this point. I think we are probably at least still a couple of quarters away from knowing exactly where that bottom is. Harris, Gerry you want to --", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Well I think that, we... we are just reacting to the news, it's developing and on the one hand I think the real story is going to be in following the charge-off activity and we are continuing to build reserves not only against home building situation, but against an economy that is slowing. And so I think charge-offs were somewhat higher than I think we would have expected three months ago and probably there is just not as much visibility out beyond the couple of months right now as there may be had been a year ago. And as we see problems we are trying to deal with them pretty aggressively, but I'd agree with Doyle, I think it's going to take another couple of quarters before we are likely... to see a likely little more stability in the number.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "Just a follow-up, we have heard several banks this quarter talk about the problems with land appraisal, [indiscernible] last saying that some of their landlords in California are being re-appraised almost zero. Can you talk about what your experience was in the quarter in some of your more challenged markets with the appraisals on land?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "We are seeing an outlying, the more distant areas in Arizona, step farther from the core of Phoenix, Tucson we are seeing over the last six months appraised values coming down 60% or more. That's for all for something like that probably true in the parts of California that East West might have talked about. I think they are mostly in Inland Empire bank. We have much smaller relative exposure in the Inland Empire more of our expert... we talked about that at late in our analyst day, but we have do some there in the Central Valle. I would think well, I don't have it in front of me, our number would be comparable. I don't know that we are getting. We have raw land, it's not... we don't have raw land being appraised at zero, but the values down a lot over the last six months. Comment Gerry?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Well, my only in addition to that is that further out it is from the core of the metropolitan area in almost no matter what markets you are in, the more it is and it reaches the 60% numbers at doors according and for the in-field properties and those are the better located. It hasn't been that much.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks guys.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Abbott with FBR. Please proceed.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi James.", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "Hi good evening.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Hi.", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "A couple of questions and actually probably more for Gerry than any one, but was there any loans that were... any non-performing asset that were sold this quarter and I think you gave a statistics a while back may be last quarter's conference call that you are receiving a 10% haircut to what you've already charged to them, which is pretty minor haircut, any update on that number", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "I don't really remember making that quote because nether last quarter nor this quarter have we really sold any loans.", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "Okay,", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "There may be some little feature there, we are not aware of it and basically no we haven t sold any.", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "Haven't sold any non-performing assets.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Nothing of any substance.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "I think we have been taken out a couple of non-performing loans by other lenders.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "That's true.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "But that's different from I think the question you're asking which is have we basically sold these loans at a heavy discount?", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "Yes. Okay. And another statistic I think you gave was non-performing assets that are still technically performing, but you've chosen because of appraisal values to put them on non-performing status, is that... that sound familiar to you?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "We talked about that in a couple of quarter ago. I think may be what you're alluding to is I think in third quarter we mentioned that 40% plus of our non-performing loans were still current asset principle and interest, is that may be what you are kind of --", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "That's what I'm getting at yes. Gerry, do you want to comment on the kind of where it stands out of the much larger number this quarter $387 million, $388 million of loans are non-accrual.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "The percentage of those that are current would not be quite that higher, but there are still... there is still large percentage of those loans that we placed on non-accrual that are actually paying current. And one reason that we do that is based on a analysis and anticipation that the barrower is not going to be able to keep them current in loan and so we put him on non-accrual even though they might still be paying current today.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "But we don't have that percentage? It's lower than 44, but I think was the number earlier but --", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "I would say it is lower than 40%, but I don't have the exact number.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Not substantial.", "James Abbott - Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co.", "Okay. All right thank you very much, I appreciate it.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Tony Davis of Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just one of the things, measures that we are looking for I think at some point if an update was the LTV for the commercial real estate portfolio. And I wondered if you have anything more recent than the June numbers may be year end or something or will we be getting that you think very soon?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "I can't promise, but I mean this has been a challenge for us as we historically had these LTVs and local databases on each bank in getting them into a common database or enterprise data warehouse on a current basis, so we can roll that stuff up contemporaneously and automated. It's been tedious and disappointingly slow to us and I am sure to you. Our next Reg FD form is in about the third week of May and I hope to have some better... an update of that chart through the end of the quarter at least in time for that presentation, about a month from now. I can't promise it, but we're going to push everybody really hard to get that done because I know you are very interested.", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Continuing on in search for specifics here Gerry, I wondered if you would share with us the percent of loans right now that are classified and kind of where that has been the last several quarters and also if you could give us any color on the degree of deterioration in credit metrics that you are seeing outside of the construction land area you mentioned you are seeing some seepage I guess, in business perhaps and small business perhaps that any color you can give us on 38 days or anything like that?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "I... because grading criteria are not consistent across companies, I don't think we want to give you the classified...", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Numbers. I will tell you because we always weigh this as the 30... because this number out in the thirty day commercial loan delinquency number is a bit under, it's look like it's... I am looking at a chart, probably about 1.4% that's 30-day delinquent not 89 day delinquent and that's up from about 1%, well under 1% prior quarters so there has been an uptick there. The... I've already said the deferrals and tackles are as low as they were. Previously, the only uptick in consumer loans is in that loan program in Arizona, nearly the percentage is pretty high, it's about 8% and everything else is remarkably low. Bank card is again just over 1.5% and mortgages and total write about 1%, again well under the industry averages.", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Final question Gerry, on your efforts at re-margining. Can you give us any color on I guess the success rate or however you define it, the frequency which you are planning yourself able to get that done?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "By and large, we do not have the re-margining capability in our documentation on every commercial real estate loan. But for those that we have had in there and have called on our borrowers to re-margin, we have been fairly successful. I would say, probably 70%, 80% of the time, these borrowers have been able to re-margin and then we even had customers where it's not included in the documentation as a requirement that we had called upon them to re-margin and the percentage would not be as high there, but probably about 40% to 50% of the time they have been able to re-margin.", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Then generally when we call in a customer to re-margin, their advance rate so to speak, we are looking at their financial statements and determining whether or not they have the capacity and capability to do so. And in order to do that you really need to look at their global debt commitment to determine whether or not they have a capacity.", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "The final question, you have felt that California was a bit farther long I guess towards stabilization and Arizona at least up there; that was the impression we have last quarter. Is that still your read of the markets you are in that the Arizona still is the weakest right now, as you see it?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "I would say that still the case, probably about the same assessment that we gave you last quarter.", "Anthony Davis - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mr. David Campbell with Owl Creek. Please proceed.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "Hi, thanks for taking my question.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Sure.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "We... I was just looking at the ratio of allowance to non-performers, which was about 4.5 times in the first quarter of 2007 and it declined to about 1.2 times in the first quarter of '08?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Right", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "At a high level were you dramatically over reserved then or are you under reserved now?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I would say it this way; it would have been very difficult to convince my auditor to go any higher in my reserve back earlier the timeframe you're citing. Until we saw deterioration or change in the economic environment, it was very difficult to push that reserve number much higher and above what we were doing in that environment was roughly speaking had a provision equal to losses with a little bit for lot there are very strong loan growth that we have. It's clearly a very different environment now and we are continuing to provide significantly in excess of current losses based on current in probable future continued deterioration impacting the credits that we have. We have a reserve methodology that gives us a range kind of where within which the reserve should be, it is throughout the time period you cited, in the upper half of that range and we have been pushing it higher. It's still within the range, but it's moving higher within the range and I would expect to likely will continue to do so.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "No, I mean on an absolute basis, just looking at the acceleration of charge-offs, I mean as a percentage of loans in one quarter that the charge offs as a percent of loans increased by 85%.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Right.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "I guess it's appropriate to multiply that 85% by 4 to get an annualized rate of --", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I would caution you against that.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Because you've got the higher level in the last half of last year. So you are starting off of a very small base a year ago this quarter.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "I am just talking about Q4. It was 28 basis points and then it's 52 basis points in the first quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "That is correct. But in effect what you are doing is you are drawing a straight line through that and expecting that increase to... you are extrapolating it three more quarters and I am not sure I would do that. In fact, that's not within our current expectations.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "What's the... when is the next Camel's assessment?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well banks are constantly assessed. We have a... we are big enough to be in the resident program.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "Got it.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sowe have various of our banks being examined at various times and I think it's fair to say that all of them have been examined in the past probably six months.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Nine months for sure.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Nine months for sure.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "Can I just ask you a general question about the adequacy of the reserves. From an economic perspective, putting aside the policies and the ranges that have been appropriate on a backward looking basis, do you believe that your reserves are adequate to cover your best guess of expected losses on the loan portfolio?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Aaron, in the portfolio at the end of the first quarter, yes.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would note that... I would just note that at the current... even at the current rate of charge-offs, if you simply extrapolated, multiplied the $50 million say by 4, that's $200 million. There is $500 million in the reserve. That's 2.5 years of current charge-offs.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "But the 52 basis points has been accelerating. Do you think it's going to level off at 52 basis points?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, not necessarily. But I can't give you a forecast of where it will go. But I don't think it's going to be a straight line upward.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "Okay.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "But we are... it's going to be determined by market... economic conditions.", "David Campbell - Owl Creek", "Just seems to me... I mean if I were a regulator, I would be concerned about dividends until we receive more information and we get a few quarters down the road.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I told you exactly what I am going to tell you that our expectation is that we will not be cutting the dividend or raising capital that dilutes common.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Can we go on to the next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Todd Hagerman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Good afternoon everybody.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Doyle, I think you mentioned before. I just want to make sure I understood this correctly, is roughly three quarters the increase in non-performers included Colorado as well as Nevada and Arizona. Southern California was not mentioned, I don't believe.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "If I said that, I am sorry; I meant California.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Okay.I thought we had a new entry into the mix there.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "If my Colorado CEO is listening, I apologize for your heart attack.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Okay. I was wondering then perhaps if you could just expand on then the comments that you made just in terms of you were seeing or starting to see at least some initial signs of weakness in terms of you mentioned Utah, Idaho and you have talked a little bit about the delinquency trend. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color in terms of exactly what you are seeing in terms of that weakness. And then secondarily to that, just to kind to follow on the reserve issue, how you are thinking about reserve coverage, particularly outside of real estate, if you will.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I will start on the... with the Utah, Idaho and then maybe turn it over to Gerry to elaborate on that and talk about reserve coverage if he wants. In where... what we have seen in a lot of markets including Utah and Idaho and even in the Northwest is a significant slowdown in home sales, a flattening of prices. We have not begun to see price declines, but wouldn't be surprised if there were some to come. Those markets did not inflate at anything like the level that Arizona and Nevada did for so long. So any price adjustment is probably going to be more modest, but the marked slowdown in home sales has led to a marked slowdown in home starts which is putting some stress on builders in the Inner Mountain West markets as well. And we are reflecting some of that stress in increased provisions and downgrades and so forth in Utah.", "Anecdotally, they are seeing a little bit of commercial deterioration in trades and businesses that are sort of related to that market like plumbers, electricians and so forth. But that's what is going on in some of the non-Southwestern markets, a little bit of stress related to slowdown. You want elaborate on that, Gerry?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "It would be pretty hard to elaborate on. You covered it pretty well. But I would just emphasize the fact that we really didn't see the inflation in residential home prices in these markets and therefore don't expect to see near the depth that we have experienced in the three markets, California, Arizona and Nevada.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We also didn't see the big supply come on to the market of new products. So I mean it's --", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Right, and we didn't see the investors coming into the market and they are the quantity that we saw in the three South Western states. With respect to the building of the reserve, I think, as you can see, our provisions are substantially higher than even our increased level of losses. And there is really two reasons: one is... one reason would be the anticipated potential for further deterioration in the real estate market. But the other reason is because we anticipate that it is going to spill over as we are starting to see it to a small degree spilling over into the commercial and industrial type portion of our portfolio.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "That's helpful. And Gerry, just a follow up on that. I believe we covered this at the Investor Day, but again, if you could just maybe just remind us. In terms of your outstanding portfolio, about roughly what percentage would represent kind of the trade businesses or the related businesses, if you will? In terms of the plumbers, if you look at the supply chain there.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "I really can't give you an exact percentage, but it's a pretty small percentage of our C&I portfolio.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Is it more than 5%, would you say?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "It might be around 5, but it certainly wouldn't be more than 10%.", "Todd Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Great. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Beyond that, I mean the ultimate part of your question is you are asking me to forecast the bottom of a recession in terms of how long could this reserve build last. And I simply can't do that. We are going to continue to provide and build a reserve I think until we are clearly start to see it turn or a leveling off there in the economy and can see the upside. And best guess is that's going to last another couple, three quarters any way, but beyond that I can't forecast any better than you can.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brain Klock with KBW. Please proceed.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello Brain.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon guys.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome to the coverage.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Well, thanks. I guess I don't want to keep you too much longer. We have already been on the call for a while. But just a couple of quick questions. All of my questions have been answered already. With the loan growth, you had talked about the C&I loan growth was pretty solid this quarter. Did you say what geographies that came out of? I was jumping on another call, so was it Texas driving a lot of that or maybe...", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Texas, Utah and Colorado and Pacific Northwest, although that's a small piece, but they had strong growth.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. And I am not sure if you have broken this out or if we wait for the Q, but within the non-accrual, the $388 million, do you have that by category how much of that is construction versus C&I et cetera?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "No, but I can tell you that the majority of it is the construction versus C&I.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it's... I think it's well over a majority would be residential land, acquisition, development, construction, credits, not commercial industrial and not other CRE.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. And I guess maybe same question on the charge-off, the $53.8 million, how much of that was the residential land versus...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Again, the significant majority I believe. We are going to...", "Unidentified Company Representative", "One C&I deal in Texas that had $5 million.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Let see. Okay. Of the commercial, I will just take commercial lending charge-offs across the whole territory were $15.6 million during the quarter and that Harris mentioned there was one, about a $5 million one in Texas and that accounts for a third of that; the rest were all well under... all the other banks were well under $5 million. There was $30 million of commercial real estate. Almost all of that is residential and California and Nevada followed by Arizona were the three biggest sources of that charge off. And together they account for 19% of the commercial real estate charge-offs.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, great, that's helpful. And I know that there were some other questions earlier about the reserve level, the NPLs et cetera. Do you guys... I guess when you do this, obviously, you look at each bank's level of reserve and then kind of as you roll those up instead of at a global consolidated level like we see here in the release. So I would imagine that as you are building that reserve, you are looking at the Texas bank versus the Nevada bank versus the California bank's reserve.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes,that is correct, right.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Do you happen to have that or should we wait for the Q as to what the level of reserves to NPLs at each individual bank.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't have that in front of me. What I can tell you is that I mentioned that we have this range. And the lowest coverage in any one bank...or the lowest position of any of the banks is about the 65th percentile of the range. And they range up to... and they go up to... one of the banks is at 100%, i.e. they are very top of its range.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. And then last question, Doyle, and I am not sure... there has been a couple of banks that have reported this quarter that actually have taken a goodwill impairment. And they said their action was really prompted by the fact that their stock has been trading below their stated book value.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "And I guess I know you guys just did your impairment test in October. Now is that something you would have to... I don't know if you are getting pressured from an auditor or is that something that you would have to consider or do you have wait [ph].", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "It is something that we would have to consider. And you are correct in that we are trading at or slightly below book value. And that is one of the indices of impairment of goodwill. It is not totally depository of it, but it is something we would have to consider. And I would say a prolonged, significant price at less than book value would increase the indicy. But that's... our test is once a year and we'll see where we are this fall. Now if something happens that says there are other indices piling up, then we don't have... we shouldn't wait until this fall again. So it's not that we have a blind eye to it. I am not getting undue pressure from my auditor over that issue, but it's something he is aware of and I am aware of.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Okay, that's helpful because I know there are different auditors, different banks have different issues. But you are right. I think the other ones that have had an impairment have had a longer period of time I guess with a market capital that it has stated [ph]. I appreciate it. Thanks guys.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Ken Usdin with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. Just a question about again the NPA growth relative to provisions. I know that it's a much more complex model than I am going to try to ask about here. But I look at the fourth quarter where you provided... over provided by $40 something million and charge-offs... non-performers went up by about $90 million. This quarter you over provided again by 40 something million, but non-performers went up by $150 million. So the reserve did build, but it didn't seem to build as fast as the growth in NPA. So my question is just about can you just talk about your view on newer NPAs and severity levels I guess versus what was already on the book and being written off? So just trying to get an assessment of your forward look on severity on newer NPAs I guess versus your prior views in prior quarters.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well a lot of that... I mean implicit in your question is kind of an assumption that a loan that goes NPA could result in a loss of the [ph] down to the loan. If you are matching... if the loan reserve build was matching the NPA build, or you thought it should, that's what you are implying. But again, as we've discussed, a significant amount of the new NPAs and a significant amount of the total NPAs are real estate related where you have collateral. And our practice is when there is a downgrade to... if the... you are going to charge down a loan if your appraised value is less than your loan balance with a haircut. So you are going to take... but there is also an assumption that your collateral value will cover a part of... or all of the loan.", "So the loss content in these real estate related loans is not 100% of the loan balance. And that's why the reserve coverage of NPAs doesn't have to stay the same as the NPA balance grows if most of the increase is coming from real estate collateralized loans and you are staying current on your appraisals and charging them down as you go. And that's what we do.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "No, of course, I understand that you are not talking about dollar-for-dollar. So what I am... so right, so what I am trying to just assess is just your outlook on severity of loss against those I guess collateralized real estate positions versus what you might have been thinking. Like have you changed your modeling with regard to expected loss assumptions any differently than you had been in the past?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well changing modeling, I would say no. But I think again as we I think discussed at our Analyst Day when we walked you through a couple of specific credits and how they evolved over time in this space. To be very simplistic, if you started off with a $10 million loan with $20 million of collateral, you have got a 50% loan to value. And as long as the loan is performing and the collateral value hasn't declined by more than 50%, you have a... and there is a very simplified example... you have not suffered a loss. But when you go from 50% decline to 60% decline, now you have suffered a $2 million... with the kind of collateral decline or value declines that we have seen in the Southwest, we are seeing an uptick in losses due to the lower collateral coverage of the loans. And that's one of the things I think that's driving these loss amounts up at a faster rate than non-performing assets are going up. But again, we think the reserve coverage, we're constantly adjusting for the sort of the new level of loss content on a loan-by-loan basis. And by pushing ourselves up in our reserve range, we are becoming incrementally more conservative as we do that.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, got it. Thanks for that explanation. My second just quickly is just on the commercial side, C&I small business, I know you talked about a little bit of deterioration on the related to housing. But I was just wondering, can you just walk through the geography again and give any comments on, if you're just seeing, what signals are you seeing of any deterioration in just straight consumer that's not related, just kind of core businesses given that you do have a really good view into the small business environment?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I'm sorry, you said consumer and you said C&I or are you wanting --", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "I'm sorry, I meant commercial, sorry, C&I small business.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I mean we actually part of this call tried to look at whether there was any consistent pattern by geography or zip code of change in the C&I portfolio. And we couldn't discern one. It's just been a slight... net of... I mean there is some up, there is some down by code or zip code and net-net, it sort of... it's a bit of an uptick, not alarming but netted has drifted upwards in delinquencies.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ms. Heather Wolf with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch", "Hi there. I hear somebody whispering just one question. So I'll ask just one question.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "We are sensitive to the fact that it's getting little late, we got several in the queue, so.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch", "I completely understand. I am just wondering if Gerry can give us any color on the probability of default and loss severity that you have currently experienced in your California, Arizona, and Nevada construction books?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "I don't know where to start. The... no, we have seen a definite increase in the volume of credits that have gone into default and as Doyle talked about quite extensively a few minutes ago, it really depends on where the property is located as to the severity of the loss that we'd end up taking as a result of the declining property values. Those properties that are closer into the core of the population mass are... we are realizing a lower less of a depreciation in value and therefore less potential loss whereas those that are distant from and in the outlying areas, the probability of loss is higher.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "So also have a lot to do with the sponsor of the deal and I think in California, I can think of some deals where we have some really strong sponsors, you've got Calpers [ph] or where they've continued to support their equity position in the project and I... gets back in those small measure to some of the re-margining that Gerry is talking about as well.", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Heather, I would give you one other pieces of information, I don't have the exact numbers, but I will tell you that in... I'm pretty sure, Gerry and I look at each other, I'm pretty very sure that in Arizona and Nevada over 50% of our residential land acquisition and development portfolio is criticized or classify, which means there is an elevated level of reserve against very significant portion of the total. I think it's a little less than 50% in California, but it's still significant. So we've gone through this entire portfolio several times over the course of the last 8 or 9 months and I think we've taken a pretty hefty whack at it.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch", "So it sounds like going forward what we're going to see is increase in loss severity assumptions rather than much higher probabilities of default?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Probably because you have less collateral cushion the further you get into this.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, Okay thank you very much appreciated", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Yeah.", "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Norman Jaffe with Sunova Capital. Please proceed.", "Norman Jaffe - Sunova Capital", "Hi thank you for taking my call.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure.", "Norman Jaffe - Sunova Capital", "Regarding the available for sale portfolio?", "Norman Jaffe - Sunova Capital", "Yes.", "Norman Jaffe - Sunova Capital", "And I know you said that you are taking OCI marks on your bank and insurance trust preferred portfolio. What of that or how close are you to an event that was might trigger an OTTI occurrence?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Pretty far we think.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Pretty far, we have to see a lot of Insurance companies or lot of banks go overall.", "Norman Jaffe - Sunova Capital", "But does the... how does the market value over the pools impact the potential impairment, even if they don't go broke, you just have the cool itself or the underlying individual securities trading at a deep discount to your sort of cost base. Does that impact what could trigger an OTTI event?", "Gerald J. Dent - EVP, Credit Administration", "Well, if they were deep and it persisted, yes. But you know, you have got $200 million of pre-tax marks on $ 4.7 billion portfolio, that's not a heavy discount.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well, it's only one indication I mean if the security is got a big mark on it that's one indication. You do have to look and underneath and say, you know is the collateral performing and do you expect it to continue to perform, how much coverage do you have, for example if you have got collateral, 100% in excess of what your tranche is, it is pretty hard to argue that that's other than temporary impaired.", "Norman Jaffe - Sunova Capital", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yeah.", "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ms. Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi Jennifer.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Hi. On the margin, it seem like you were expecting a little more compression in the January call and even at the investor day, can you just give us a flavor of what kind of change during the quarter that held the margin more stable?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well, I think the biggest contributor was we saw a better deposit pricing as the quarter went on and as more rate cuts come through, the industry as a whole and which enabled us specifically that we are able to pass more of those rate cuts on. So that was the biggest contributor, probably the second biggest was the fact that we did month-by-month get to see on the loan originations and renewals better and increasingly better spreads. Now pushing the pricing on loan tier was one of the key levers that contributed to holding the balance sheet growth in check as well for managing any stresses on capital. The offset to that was probably the single offset to that was the decline in DDA balances, which had a little bit of negative impact, but we were not as I guess earlier in the quarter it didn't look like with the liquidity pressures and everybody was seeing the deposit pricing might be as responsive as it turned out to be.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you, I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shelly Davis with Finansbank [ph]. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Sorry, hello, if you did have to raise capital for any reason what sort of capital would it be, I suppose trust preferred to something like that and how much of that could you raise to bring your ratios up to say the middle of your range.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "We think, Shelly [ph] that the capital markets are open to us. We've had a whole parade of investment bankers coming through here, offering to raise... trust preferred, hybrid trust preferred, DRD preferred, convertible preferred and more recently subordinated debt. But the only thing they tell us that they can't raise the senior debt and we've proven that we can raise it ourselves. There is no other... we are aware of any other A or BBB rated or lower bank holding company as raised any unsecured holding companies senior debt, since early last fall and we've done it three times now. What we... what is not attract... so the markets have loosened up there is availability of capital what is totally unattractive is the pricing in terms of those capital... that capital, that's why we are trying to proactively manage the company in a way so that we don't have get for ourselves in the hands of the vultures, and we determine to not do that.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I think we are helped by the fact that we have... I mean we historically had as we said before in the call a very low dividend payout ratio that's serving us really well right now, we try these buybacks sort of the swing method of getting capital back to shareholders and that's proven to be a good strategy I think, now the point is, it's going on cycle, so.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right. Okay. So the level that are you talking charge-off was higher I think the many thought would be but, and it is taken enough as one person said not quite a percentage rated this path [ph] as a charge-off rate but, you explain why that would be, but do you think looking forward as that the provisioning will continue build at least for two more quarters at the sort of same rate or and tailwind from a widening of your net interest margin do you think they will help you to build that reserve?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I am not do... was your question, do we think did the provision will continue to increase at the rate?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right", "Unidentified Company Representative", "OR JUST,", "Unidentified Company Representative", "How do say, you were bit surprised ourselves by the fact that we've ended up providing a bit more than we have guided to and the losses were higher than we guided to. Best expectation right now is that losses may that they will be equal to or slightly higher than this quarter, and same with provision, but not markedly so. It's a... there are lot of moving parts out there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Okay.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "And I'd point that in terms of capital build I've indicated there is a limited amount of additional probable or potential OTTI fair value marks. And therefore you know, that the drag on earnings and the drag of going capital to growing from that source probably is limited at this point. And therefore there is room within the kind of the current earnings level to increase the provision even further and therefore not drawdown capital any... I will point out again that during this quarter we have sort an additional $1.5 billion or more capability under more of actually closer three quarters and a billion or more securities and commercial paper from Lockhart. We have sort of $46 million of OTTI a larger reserve percentage and intangible equity ratio actually increase... $200 million of marks through OCI and tangible equity ratio increased not a lot, but it did increase.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yeah, that was impressive. And so, okay, so that it gives you some potential possibility I supposed for instead of markdown or markups.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "No we... as long as it's not OTTI yes, there is that potential and that is correct.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, sir.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Doyle Arnold for closing remarks.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Well thank you all for your attention and your patience and your interest. I know it's been a long earnings season for you and a long call for us. Just to summarize, while there are still some weak spots in the franchise. There is also some strength and some things to be encouraged about. And we are somewhat encouraged by where we are right now. And we look forward to... and we are key... I will say just we are keenly aware of your interest and understanding updates on those LTVs and we are going to do the best we can to get you some reasonable realistic numbers there recognizing that's changing very rapidly.", "With that we again thank you so much for your interest in Zions, and we look forward to seeing you at conferences during the quarter and on the call again in July.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Clark Hinckley, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; please proceed sir.", "Clark Hinckley", "Good evening everybody and thank you for joining us for this quarterly conference call on October 16, 2008. During this call we will reference several pages from our earnings press release. If you do not have a copy of this earnings release you can download it from our website in PDF format and the website at www.zionsbancorporation.com. A link to the release is near the top of the page.", "During today's call, we will discuss the expected performance of the company. Such statements constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act. Actual results may differ materially from the projections provided in this call since such projections involve significant risks and uncertainties. A complete disclaimer is included in the press release and is incorporated into this call. We are not responsible for transcripts of this call made by independent third parties.", "I will now turn the time over to our Chairman and CEO, Harris Simmons.", "Harris Simmons", "Thank you very Clark and welcome to all of you. This has obviously been a rather extraordinary quarter in the world. We had a quarter that was marked by several significant internal events. We strengthened both our GAAP and regulatory capital ratios with GAAP capital ratios that now are at their highest level in three years.", "This was done with a combination of very careful balance sheet management combined with raising new capital in some innovative ways that enabled us to raise nearly $300 million of new capital which is in line with our guidance and done at rates and terms that I think were quite favorable compared to the market.", "We also continued to build our reserve levels in the face of a still very uncertain economic environment. I think its clear that as this quarter has unfolded that the uncertainty around what the national economy and the economies of the markets that we operate in will look like over the course of the next several quarters is probably less certain then it had been earlier in the year. ", "Consequently we\u2019ve pulled our reserve to a point that it is now 46% higher then it was a year ago, an increase over the past year of $191 million in our loan loss reserve and that trend continued this quarter.", "We bolstered our core deposits by acquiring the insured deposits of the failed Silver State Bank in Las Vegas with a few locations also over in Phoenix. We reduced our reliance on outside funding; our short-term borrowings at the Federal Home Loan Bank system for example came down from a peak of about $6.8 billion earlier in the year, to $3.8 billion at quarter end insuring that we have ample liquidity for any unforeseen needs.", "So we have a lot of capacity at the home loan system as well as at the Fed. Not surprisingly there is a lot of noise in this quarter\u2019s results as financial markets were win a state of real disarray and inter bank funding rates gyrated wildly and you\u2019ll see some effects in our numbers particularly from the spike up in the LIBOR rate and the way that\u2019s effected some non-hedged derivative basis swaps that we have.", "But it\u2019s also effecting relationships between the prime rate and some of our deposit costs and we\u2019ll talk more about that during the call. Credit continued to weaken as we moved through this down cycle and real estate we continue to deal with that. ", "Our 2007 Annual Report carried the title Successfully Navigating A Challenging Landscape and as it turns out this has been a more challenging landscape then I think most of us ever saw. The landscape is also changing in ways that were almost unimaginable just a few months ago. ", "We have avoided some of the industries biggest problems including subprime mortgage lending and high loan to value home equity credit lines but we\u2019re not immune to residential development and construction problems nor are immune to the broader impact of a slowing economy. ", "While our net earnings showed the impact of these increased economic pressures, our core business remains remarkably strong and in the midst of this turmoil we successfully fortified and continue to strengthen the balance sheet to prepare for whatever the future may hold and take advantage of opportunities that we expect will come our way and we do think there will be some in the course of the next several quarters.", "I think its also worth noting that we have been recognized recently for doing what we think we do best even in these very challenging times and that\u2019s just good solid basic banking. US Banker Magazine ranked Zions Bank as having the second best team of women bankers in the industry. We are very proud of these talented and dedicated employees. They and their colleagues remind us that even as they face the environment, being energetic and honest and doing the right thing for customers is the key to long-term success. ", "We are also very pleased that Greenwich Associates, well known and respected research firm which measures customer loyalty and commitment recently awarded Zions Bancorporation its coveted excellence in middle market banking award. We were one of a small handful of national winners winning that award both in overall satisfaction and in treasury management, an area in which we are making a lot of inroads and strengthening our product offering.", "With that brief introduction I\u2019ll now ask Doyle Arnold, our Chief Financial Officer to review the quarterly performance. ", "Doyle Arnold", "Thank you Harris, good afternoon, good evening everyone. In summary we earned $33.4 million or $0.31 per share applicable to common for the quarter. That\u2019s within a rather wide range of estimates for the quarter but certainly below the median or midpoint of that range. I think in terms of the major drivers of performance in which we give guidance I think loan growth which was flat was as well controlled or better then we guided toward.", "The margin was down just slightly about what we guided toward. The OTTI impairment on CEOs was slightly better then probably we guided toward but credit costs were higher then guidance as Harris mentioned we, as the quarter went on we further strengthened the provision as the real and potential deterioration in the economic climate continued to show its face. ", "And then also the non-hedged derivative income line about which I\u2019ll talk a lot was much worse then you might have expected for reasons I\u2019ll explain that is not a recurring number but it probably did detract $0.15 a share at least from earnings this quarter. You can make your own judgment after I discuss.", "As Harris mentioned capital ratios were bolstered by the capital issuances and we did acquire a failed bank which, in Nevada, the deposits of a failed bank from the FDIC that bolstered the deposit numbers.", "What I\u2019d like to do now as always is walk through some of the individual line items on the various schedules that accompany the press release that I believe you all should have and I will start with page 13, the period end consolidated balance sheets and point out a few highlights on that page. ", "In the loan section about the middle quartile of the page, you can see that prior to provision loan growth was essentially flat within about $4 million of being flat. We indicated that after a very robust second quarter we were going to have to clamp down on that number very strongly to conserve capital and reduce stress on funding and we did so.", "That\u2019s good news for us and bad news for the economy and clearly one of, the fact that a lot of banks are taking these kinds of actions is one of the things driving the Treasury\u2019s and Fed\u2019s recent macro moves. ", "There was loan growth in Amegy Bank, Vectra Bank and our Pacific Northwest banks but this was offset by some loan sales in Utah, and shrinkage in the residential real estate construction and development loans in the southwestern markets due to both charge-downs and pay downs.", "The total assets in the middle of the page actually declined about $657 million reflecting some securities pay downs, the flat loan growth and other measures. So the balance sheet actually shrank during the quarter. ", "Moving now to the liabilities and shareholders equity sections under deposits, you\u2019ll note that period end non interest bearing demand declined about $320 million although, on the average balance sheet pages you can see that it average non interest bearing deposit accounts were up about $130 million.", "The core deposits as noted in the text increased by about $800 million, a significant portion of that core deposit growth was result of our acquisition of deposits from the failed Silver State Bank, mostly in Nevada with a bit of it in Arizona.", "We paid down wholesale borrowings of various kinds during the quarter both using those increased deposits and another source which I\u2019ll mention in a moment Fed funds purchased as you can see declined $1.2 billion, repo agreements declined $276 million, commercial paper was down not quite $100 million, federal home loan bank and fed auction borrowings declined $340 million. They actually ran up significantly early in the quarter and then came back down to be slightly less then prior period end.", "In addition to the core deposit growth we did acquire approximately $670 million of brokered deposits during the quarter which were used to reduce wholesale borrowings primarily from the home loan bank borrowings and Fed funds borrowings.", "In the shareholders equity section you can see things we\u2019ve already talked about, preferred stock increased $46.9 million as the result of the perpetual preferred stock that we issued through our own Zions direct subsidiary in July and then common stock increased $258 million. The bulk of that was the result of our very successful ATM Equity program that we launched and completed in early September, that added as noted in the text about $245 million to common equity.", "Other comprehensive income was essentially unchanged as we\u2019ll talk about later as additional fair value marks on securities were offset by improved marks on our interest rate swaps that we used to manage net interest income and as a result of all of those moving parts, the tangible capital ratio increased 63 basis points to 6.60% at the end of the quarter. ", "That\u2019s a number you can find on the previous page 12. Moving on now to the income statement, page 14, first net interest income before provision increased slightly despite the five basis point decline in the net interest margin. That margin decline primarily resulted from lower average asset yields not offset by lower interest bearing, interest costs on interest bearing deposits and also the higher level of NPAs on average through the quarter.", "Non interest income I\u2019ll highlight several lines there, dividends and other investment income continued to decline as you might expect in the current economic environment. We had a loss on Farmer Mac stock of approximately $8 million which was partially offset by gains in other investments.", "Loan sales and servicing declined as a result of the repurchase of securitized loans from Lockhart funding that occurred late in the second quarter. So we had the income from that service in most of the second quarter and we had essentially none of it in the third quarter. A similar decline is also seen in income from the securities conduit for similar reasons.", "As noted earlier the fair value and as I mentioned earlier, fair value and non-hedged derivative loss was $26 million in the period compared to a loss of $19.8 million in the prior period. That again reflects the very, very abhorrent or stressed behavior of the spread between prime and LIBOR. That spread continues to narrow and in relevant measure today there is no spread. ", "Three month LIBOR is 4.5% and prime is 4.5%. The bulk of the losses last quarter and this quarter are due to marking to market the future stream of in essence that spread and taking that fair value mark through income in the quarter. So these primarily reflect changes in fair value marks. I\u2019ll discuss this again later. You should not think of these as a recurring level even if the spread between prime and LIBOR does not return to anything like normalcy.", "These are more like one-time marks and they may come back if those spreads revert to something a bit more normal. We\u2019ll come back to that in the guidance section.", "Equity securities gains were nearly $13 million this quarter. There were a variety of gains and losses here. The largest single gain was from the sale of our significant interest in a mutual fund management firm called [Excessor] Capital Management. That accounted for about $7.7 million of the gain.", "And finally impairment losses of $28 million on REIT and bank insurance CDOs is the lowest number in the last four quarters is probably in line with or slightly better then our guidance. I\u2019m not going to talk about the non interest expense line because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a whole lot worth talking about there. But we\u2019re happy to answer questions if there are any about the behavior of any particular lines.", "On page 16, changes in shareholders equity and OCI, we give you the period to period roll forward the top third of the page shows you the changes in the first quarter, middle third is the second quarter and the bottom third is the third quarter. Third column from the right, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, you\u2019ll note the total of negative $158 million June 30 and $157 million at September 30. Essentially other comprehensive income net was unchanged and there were offsetting movements as I mentioned in the fair value marks on AFS securities and the mark to market on our interest rate swaps.", "Moving to page 17 the investment securities portfolio, we added this schedule last quarter to provide additional details on the portfolio. I will note a number that isn\u2019t on this page but if you go back into the quarterly income statement numbers you can add up that we have now cumulatively taken $271 million of OTTI charges on this portfolio against income and that number is basically not reflected on this page. It would be sort of to the left hand side of the left most column on the page prior to current amortized costs.", "So in looking at how much is capital been hit if you will by the weakness in this portfolio you can take that $271 million and add to it the bottom number in the second column of numbers, net unrealized losses in OCI of $394 million and so cumulatively we have reduced GAAP capital by a pre-tax amount of $668 million or about $434 million after-tax, as a result of a combination of OTTI impairment charges and OCI marks. ", "And then in addition there are to date $330 million of FAS 157 fair value marks on the held to maturity portfolio that are not reflected in OCI. To save you the trouble of going back to prior quarters, the comparable unrealized loss not in OCI in the second quarter was $184.7 million so the higher default probabilities and higher discount rates have increased that loss from $184.7 million to $330.3 million this quarter.", "Now as most of you know there\u2019s been essentially no trading in the bank trust preferred CDOs during the past quarter and this fact required that we move these securities from Level 2 Matrix methodology for determining fair value to Level 3, a model based methodology and we can go into the details of our model approach if you want. ", "But the key things are we are using an [Imtex] model with default probabilities on every name in the various tranches that we hold. There are 1,014 individual names. We determine default probabilities on each name using a stock market value based approach to default probabilities purchased from a third party service. ", "We use discount rates on the resulting cash flows that reflect current CDS spreads and discount all of those back on to determine fair value. We\u2019ve also used a Monte Carlo method which looks at the volatility of outcomes of these expected values. That approach would yield substantially less severe marks then are reflected on this page but we have not used those here, we have used the more conservative approach.", "Turning to page 18, credit quality, non performing assets increased $227 million this quarter. That\u2019s about $35 million or $40 million less then the increase last quarter. The ending number is $924 million. The percentage increase period-over-period was 32.5% this quarter compared to 61% prior quarter. We\u2019ve seen a slight tapering but only slight in the rate of increase in these NPAs. The largest portion of the increase was in National Bank of Arizona where property values continued to decline during the quarter.", "We also saw increased NPAs in Zions bank driven primarily by softer economic conditions. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more decreased slightly, about $11 million. Some of the reduction can be attributed to increased non-accruals and charge-offs and also note that one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend but it is somewhat encouraging that this number is not continuing to escalate at an alarming rate. ", "Net charge-offs down in the bottom half of the page were $95.3 million, probably somewhat above our guidance and above the prior quarter but at 91 basis points of annualized on compared to average loans this is still relatively good for the industry today. ", "This level of charge-offs as we pointed out before we believe has been mitigated by our conservative underwriting including LTD ratio and CRE lending and a stronger consumer portfolio both in home mortgages and in [Heckles] where we avoided the subprime and Alt-A phenomenon. ", "There\u2019s also the fact that probably a third of our states are still relatively healthy from an economic standpoint, maybe third to a half. We did continue to build reserves in this environment. We in fact built them more then we had expected earlier in the quarter. That decision was reflective of as I said deteriorating economic conditions both that appeared to get worse after the credit seize up and the credit market seize ups that occurred after Labor Day.", "So we provided $156.6 million during the quarter, that exceeded charge-offs by $61.3 million and at quarter end and the ratio of allowance for losses to net loans and leases increased from 1.31% to 1.45%. ", "At quarter end if you annualize the net losses of the quarter that reserve is 1.6 years of annualized losses at the current quarter\u2019s run rate and a little over two years if you take the last four quarters of annualized run rate.", "Some additional comments on quality trends, as expected residential acquisition development construction loans in California, Arizona and Nevada remain the most troubled segment of the portfolio and as we\u2019ve indicated throughout the quarter Arizona is the most problematic market and experienced meaningful declines during the quarter.", "Accruing loans past due 90 days or more declined slightly from the previous quarter as noted although they do remain elevated and 30 to 89 day delinquencies increased somewhat from the prior quarter although they remain lower then that of the quarter ended, first quarter. ", "As we all know the general economy continued to slide into recession during the quarter. This broader slowdown was manifest by some measurable deterioration in the general commercial portfolio in some of our geographies, particularly in Utah and Idaho where probably after Amegy Bank we have one of our larger C&I portfolios.", "Our expectation that the complete credit market disruption that occurred starting in mid September likely will now result in a more significant and perhaps longer recession, that expectation drove our decision to further increase provision in relation to actual losses. And our loan loss reserve now exceeds 100% or the top end of the range that we calculate using historical data and it is likely to continue to increase for the next several quarters. ", "Turning to page 19, loan balances by type, commercial lending in total was down slightly during the quarter. The decrease occurred in owner occupied commercial lending and driven by reductions in our nation real estate division. We not only curtailed originations that are not relationship driven in that business but we sold approximately $100 million of these loans at par during the quarter.", "C&I loans experienced the only significant growth in the quarter, up to $11.35 billion from $11.25 billion in the prior quarter. The C&I loans in Texas continue to have significant growth but that growth was partially offset by portfolio declines in some other geographies. ", "As expected commercial real estate construction and land development loans declined during the quarter as projects were completed and problem loans were resolved. There was a slight increase in CRE term loans as some projects were completed and went into operation.", "Consumer loans were essentially flat. In summary while total loans were flat we did experience growth in some key markets and loan types while curtailing other segments. ", "Page 20, as noted previously the net interest margin decreased five basis points, the net interest spread decreased four basis points, the average yield on total loans fell 11 basis points as rates came down coupled with an increase in non-accrual loans. ", "The average rate on interest bearing deposits also declined but by only three basis points as competition for funding remained very stiff. That is where I will conclude my walk through of the schedules. I\u2019d like to try to sum up now with some guidance for next quarter or few quarters. ", "First what I\u2019d like to do is talk about the TARP US Treasury Senior Preferred Capital Program. Just note that subject to discussion with and approval by our Board we do expect to apply under this program. The approximate range of amounts for which Zions would be eligible are at the low end about $500 million and at the high end about $1.5 billion. ", "Our current expectation would be to apply for more then the minimum but probably not the maximum but we\u2019ve not decided how much. We\u2019ll be discussing that over the next week or two among ourselves and with the Board and we know of no reason why we would not receive approval if we do apply. ", "We have not yet decided whether to participate in the FDICs debt guarantee program but we do have this under active consideration. There is still a number of unanswered questions about how this program will work but essentially we do view the TARP program as the cheapest source of capital by some margin out there at the moment and we do expect to apply. ", "The additional capital from the TARP program if we receive an allocation or investment would allow us to increase loan growth somewhat which would be good for us and our shareholders and good for the economy, although we would not expect to let it go back near-term to the levels of the second quarter.", "We need to keep that loan growth and growth in core funding somewhat in balance even with the additional capital resources. We would expect residential construction and development balances to continue to decline and we do expect to remain selective on underwriting and conservative on pricing. But we would expect to let loan growth resume to a more normal pace assuming an infusion of capital and the availability of funding.", "Deposit growth is an issue. We did see some growth; we saw shrinkage early in the quarter due to some significant disruptions in our market, some growth later in the quarter. We do expect that the increase in deposit insurance limits may help deposit growth over coming quarters but too soon to tell exactly what the impact will be and we also do expect over the next year that we will have the opportunity to bid on deposits of one or more additional failed banks within our footprint. ", "With regard to the margin although loan spreads are improving the very competitive deposit market has effectively negated the impact of increasing loan spreads and we expect that this trend may continue. Recent declines in prime rate have not been matched by declines in deposit pricing and as always the behavior of DDA balance will remain a significant factor in the margin as will potential increases in non-accrual loans. ", "Again too soon to tell what the impact of 100% coverage of DDA balances with FDIC and deposit insurance may have on those numbers. Absent a very favorable impact from that source we would expect that deposit rate pressures and increases in non-accrual loans would probably lead to a further modest margin compression in the fourth quarter.", "Finally credit quality remains a top issue for most of the industry. Our best outlook is that conditions will continue to soften in most of our markets, that residential land and home prices will continue to decline somewhat over the next few quarters in Arizona and perhaps some other markets but deterioration may begin to taper off over the next few quarters. ", "MPAs provision and losses are likely to increase further over the next several quarters albeit at a slower pace as was the case this quarter. The rate of increase will be driven in large measure by general economic conditions and their impact on commercial and industrial borrowers. We have built reserves this quarter with that in mind and are likely to continue to build reserves over the next few quarters although again possibly not quite as fast as we did this quarter. It remains to be seen. ", "In summary we believe we are well positioned to weather the cycle but there will be some additional credit costs associated with that. I promised to come back to the non-hedged derivative loss and I\u2019d like to do that. Most of that loss of $26 million reflects fair value marks on the expected spread between three month LIBOR and prime for the next three to five years.", "If that spread were to remain exactly where it was at September 30, which was very, very narrow, and that continued through the fourth quarter with no change, the loss on this line item for the fourth quarter would be approximately $3 million. A significant improvement from the $26 million of this quarter. ", "For every 10 basis points that three month LIBOR and three month LIBOR expected over that maturity range of say three years, for every 10 basis points that LIBOR comes down in relation to prime, we would record a gain of approximately $7.5 million in whatever quarter that occurred.", "If the spread were to return to historical normal which is clearly the goal of the US and EU financial authorities we would expect to record gains in the $30 million to $40 million range one time on this line. ", "If there\u2019s a more realistic sort of new normal, maybe that would result in a pick up of $15 million to $25 million one time. So somewhere out there assuming that three month LIBOR comes under some modicum of control there\u2019s a significant gain to reverse these mark-to-mark losses if you will that have gone through in the last two quarters.", "And at that point the run rate for this line would become zero to positive. So for those of you building models probably the reasonable thing to do would be to model that line at zero for the time being and we\u2019ll, and keep your eye on three month LIBOR and how it behaves.", "Securities as we\u2019ve discussed, we continue to monitor the performance of the portfolio and we would expect to probably see continued impairments but likely in the range that we\u2019ve experienced in the last few quarters and like we suggested will likely continue for the next few quarters.", "And finally we would expect to apply for a significant allocation under the Treasury Senior Preferred Capital program both to increase our flexibility in an uncertain economy, to allow us to increase loan growth to our borrowing customers, and serving their needs, and also to take advantage of what we would expect will be some acquisition opportunities including some fairly low risk FDIC assisted transactions in the next few quarters. ", "In summary while it was a very noisy and difficult quarter we\u2019re pleased that we were able to strengthen our balance sheet particularly capital when that was a very difficult thing for anybody to do. We improved liquidity. We remain profitable although obviously at a lower level then we would like. ", "We do expect the next few quarters will remain challenging and test our ability to maneuver through this rapidly changing landscape but we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re positioned in a way that we can continue to do that. ", "With that I will end the monologue and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "In terms of the TARP capital if let\u2019s say you did get the money from the Treasury, I understand your statement you wanted to balance core deposit growth with loan growth, but I think one of the Treasury\u2019s requirements or desires is that banks don\u2019t horde the capital and actually use it to make loans. If you got the capital would you actually get more aggressive with your deposit rates in order to bring in the deposits to make the loans or is it just status quo in terms of your rates?", "Doyle Arnold", "Not yet decided but I would point out that if it is speculated that most of the industry gets TARP capital and then most of the industry tries to raise its deposit rates and nothing else happens all they\u2019ve done is raise costs and not raise funds unless we pull it from somewhere else. So I don\u2019t know the answer to your question. We do recognize that the intent of the whole program was to get banks lending again and we would certainly participate in that and look forward to doing that. ", "I would just point out that what we\u2019re not going to do is aggressively load up on wholesale borrowing and tap outlines at the federal home loan banks and so forth and utilize all of our backup liquidity to aggressively grow loans. We\u2019ve got to address the core funding question in concert with having the additional capital. ", "Harris Simmons", "In some markets we are seeing reasonably good deposit growth but we\u2019ve had to really tamp down loan growth and I do think it does provide us a lot more opportunity to act in the spirit in which this program was being offered to banks and that is to really meet the needs of existing customers and to look for good opportunities to continue to expand credit consistent with our ability to generate the funding. ", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "With respect to the $1.4 billion of the trust preferred CDOs that are in held maturity, I did the math on the release you have and it looks like these are currently being valued at roughly $0.60 on the dollar but I know including OTTI, you\u2019ve only taken the very small fraction of those have been written down. Maybe explain in very layman\u2019s terms at what point do you have to take a much larger OTTI on that? Because at 40% loss already its more of a concern. ", "Doyle Arnold", "I don\u2019t think there is any magic point at which we do that. We model that every quarter. We do look for comparable trades in the market and we clearly hear talk of much greater discounts. I will point out that during the last quarter we have been able to identify only one trade in one tranche of a specific CDO that we own. And I will note that that trade occurred at $0.35 on the dollar. We are carrying that security at $0.58 on the dollar. We looked at that trade, we talked to the traders, we followed the trail and we believe that that was a complete capitulation trade. We\u2019ve also analyzed what\u2019s in that security. I won\u2019t go through all of the names but if every security in there except for Wells Fargo, and a GSE failed, and we discounted it at a reasonable rate, that security would pay off at $0.68 on the dollar. ", "We\u2019ve used a higher discount rate on that security and are carrying that one at $0.58. So this is an example of how the prices that are being bandied about out there are, if you really talk to traders they\u2019re using terms like there\u2019s a handful of bottom fishers that get the joke, that these numbers aren\u2019t real. And that your position is only as strong as the weakest entity that holds a particular security, i.e. which one will have to do a distress sale at that price.", "And these very infrequent trades are in no way reflective of the actual values of these securities. So we don\u2019t think there\u2019s any magic time. The SEC or the FASB or both have come out and said there is no bright line test of either percent discount or time of discount, that it\u2019s a facts and circumstances. You\u2019ve got to look at all the evidence including trades but also your own analysis of default probabilities, cash flows and discount rates. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. ", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So irrespective if these were carried at $0.60 or $0.40 or $0.20 on the dollar in your held to maturity portfolio there\u2019s no correlation with actual write-offs that goes back to a completely different analysis, is that correct?", "Doyle Arnold", "If we did think that one of those securities was permanently impaired then we would take that impairment through income and reverse any OCI mark that might have been applied against that particular security prior to being reclassified as held to maturity. So yes, we do test these all for OTTI. And we do value them for FAS 157 purposes, the difference is if that they\u2019re held to maturity that is a, that valuation is a disclosure item.

The LTV on that piece of the portfolio is 58% and I would caution you that that\u2019s a blend of older and newer appraisals but given the circumstances, all of the properties under distress have been appraised once and in many cases multiple times over the last year.

There were a lot of things you would expect on there, mortgage backed securities and other kinds of loans but also regular commercial and CRE loans, even OREO and then anything we missed that you would like to sell. There has been no feedback of which I\u2019m aware of what they\u2019re actually going to do, how they\u2019re going to run the first auction, what they\u2019re going to do.

It was just an information gathering exercise for them to decide where should they focus their efforts to get bang for the buck.

So that\u2019s something we\u2019d have to put off. Clearly if we have a sustained period where we are not earning the dividend that will call into question whether we, what we do with the dividend, whether we trim it. On the other hand we\u2019re going to see capitalization strengthened materially across the industry and so I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to get back to you on as we have the discussion with our Board.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "On page four of the press release it does go into detail on the OTTI taken in the quarter and it says that there was three bank and insurance trust preferreds with a $19.2 million OTTI charge, I think you just said it was five banks at $20.5 million, is that right?", "Doyle Arnold", "There are end notes that make up the difference.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "On the CDO piece do you have the initial par balance for those, so the $19.2 million was the impairment, what was the par balance that was taken against?", "Doyle Arnold", "I can tell you kind of where it came from, you mean the par balance--?", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "What level of impairment was it?", "Doyle Arnold", "They\u2019re not large.

We actually start out with the probability of default which Doyle explained which we get from the publically traded companies and we use QRM, KMVs and other methodologies, the Merton model, and we get those probabilities of default and then we come up with the cash flows that we expect to receive on each one of those securities through the waterfall, through the [Intex] model.

And so then, we subsequent to that, then price the securities and as Doyle mentioned we use the CLO spreads from JPMorgan Chase and we use those spreads against the cash flows that we generate in the [Intex] model and we come up with what we believe the present value pricing is or the fair value pricing and then that determines the amount of OTTI that was taken on those securities that failed the OTTI test.

The total in that portfolio is $8.8 billion and this was just a loan sale to kind of reduce the balance sheet size to create a little room for some new lending without straining capital ratios. They were sold at par, they were not distressed loans.", "Doyle Arnold", "I just clarified that the $8.8 billion includes owner-occupied other than those in this national program.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "And Gerry, just any more color on the stress levels that you\u2019re seeing in CNI and in income property, and I would gather perhaps retail income property, by geography.", "Gerald J. Dent", "We are seeing an increase in the level of cost-side credits, pretty much across most of our banks in the CNI portfolios, but not significant. When we dissect that and try to determine just what type of CNI credits are having more difficulty and causing us to classify them, some of the loans are related to the construction industry, but generally speaking I would say just as large a portion of those loans that are having stress are related to restaurant-type loans. The loans where people have discretionary income that they would spend, those types of retailers and business that are dependent on that are also having stress.", "With respect to retail credits in the commercial real estate portfolio, we are starting to see several indications of stress there. We are noticing a lot of the landlords giving concessions in order to retain their tenants. They are starting to see increased vacancies in the Arizona market, in the Nevada, and probably in the California market as well. It would probably be fair to say that those construction projects that are nearing completion are going to have a very hard time leasing up, just because even the national retailers are starting to pull back and cancel their letters of intent.", "And so, yes, it\u2019s becoming evident. We have got one retail project in our whole system that has gone to other-estate owned. We have got a few that are classified but it hasn\u2019t hit our portfolio as heavy as I would have expected and as heavy as it probably can. That\u2019s obviously the next segment of the commercial real estate portfolio to [next shoe drop].", "Doyle Arnold", "In the interest of time we would like to ask you to ask your one most important question and we won\u2019t do follow ups, just out of respect for the people back East and how late it\u2019s getting.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kenneth Usdin- Bank of America Securities.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "As far as to follow on Tony\u2019s question, the deterioration that you\u2019re seeing, it sounds like the construction stuff is getting worse, it\u2019s spilling into other parts of the book as the economy gets worse. So as far as just trying to understand where you have to continue to reserve to, should we expect the magnitude of over-provisioning to also widen in addition to charge-offs going up?", "Doyle Arnold", "At this point I wouldn\u2019t expect the magnitude to widen. It will continue to exceed charge-offs but clearly something changed after Labor Day, in the economy as a whole. And you\u2019re seeing that in most of the statistics that are coming out, in the Beige Book comments from the Fed earlier this week, so I want to be a little bit cautious about this. But we do expect that charge-offs aren\u2019t about to come down, the provision is not about to come down. They both may drift up for the next few quarters. ", "I don\u2019t know if we will continue to over-provide at a rate of $60.0 million a quarter. Maybe a bit less but maybe something more. We\u2019ve had some kind of an inflection point, I think is our sense in the economy and it\u2019s too soon to know just how this is going to evolve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Heather Wolf \u2013 Merrill Lynch.", "Heather Wolf - Merrill Lynch", "Is there any way we could get a breakdown of the increase in NPLs by product type as opposed to geography?", "Doyle Arnold", "Probably not today. We don\u2019t have it this early here in the quarter but we could probably produce it and certainly put it in the Q.", "Heather Wolf \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Is there any way you could just give us order of magnitude, other than construction? Which loan products drove?", "Doyle Arnold", "I think that\u2019s the bulk of it. There\u2019s very little of it in the consumer. The bulk of it is in CRE portfolio. And there\u2019s some in the owner-occupied, probably Around $50.0 million of the increase is in that owner-occupied national real estate program. It\u2019s in part reflective of a change in the accounting rules. We think that it\u2019s money-good, that the government will, at the end of the day, exercise provisions to allow it to protect its interest on the guaranteed portion. ", "But the fact that that takes about nine months to work its way through, we\u2019ve become more conservative in the last two quarters about the point at which we put that stuff on non-accrual. And that probably accounts for, Gerry do you know, is it about $50.0 million this quarter?", "Gerald J. Dent", "It would be probably less than $50.0 million. ", "Doyle Arnold", "Do you have any other thoughts on how much of this, roughly, might be CNI?", "Gerald J. Dent", "I think probably the majority of it is residential real estate. I don\u2019t have a specific number, but I would speculate it\u2019s probably about a third of it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Timmons \u2013 Stern Agee.", "Edward Timmons \u2013 Stern Agee", "You talked a little bit last quarter about the levels of subornation in the banking insurance CDOs. Can you give us an idea of just the single-A and triple-B rated tranches, where does that stand? If  you could ballpark that. And deferrals, they\u2019re kind of increasing at a pretty good clip here, I guess 22 to 38 this quarter. How is that modeled into?", "David Blackford", "At the present time in our model that we\u2019re using, we\u2019re assuming that any bank, bank holding company, insurance company that defaults is worth zero. We\u2019re assuming no recoveries. And we\u2019re making the same assumption for deferrals, which I realize is fairly harsh but we think that\u2019s what gives us comfort that the numbers are in the ballpark.", "So all of those 38 deferrals are being assumed at zero with no recovery.", "Harris Simmons", "And we don\u2019t have in front of us the level of subordination this quarter. It hasn\u2019t changed all that much.", "Doyle Arnold", "What would change the real subordination level would be actual defaults, and the fact is there weren\u2019t that many bank failures in total during the quarter and only a couple of those were held in any of the securities that we owned.", "Edward Timmons \u2013 Stern Agee", "Would it be fair to say it\u2019s about 10% for most of these?", "Doyle Arnold", "The weakest would be low single digits and probably 10% to 20% would be an average. I can\u2019t remember what we said last quarter. Whatever we said last quarter, it\u2019s going to be approximately what it is. It hasn\u2019t changed much at all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Abbot \u2013 Friedman Billings Ramsey.", "James Abbot - Friedman Billings Ramsey ", "On the reserve net charge-off ratio, I\u2019m just looking at that reserve of 145 basis points, the 91 basis points of net charge-off, and that ratio has been narrowing over time. Could you give us a sense if there\u2019s a point where you say enough is enough and you\u2019re going to maintain a spread there? Some banks have maintained a 2 to 1 coverage ratio. What\u2019s your thought on that?", "Doyle Arnold", "I would first point out that if you go back to a couple of recent investor presentations, we\u2019ve actually tracked that number for us compared to the industry and at the end of last quarter our coverage, by that measure, was about 1/3 higher than the average of the top 50 banks. I think ours was 2 years and the industry average was 1.5 years.", "We are still above the industry average from a quarter ago, today, at 1.6. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a magic number that we have in mind. Again, we build up our reserve from the bottom up and then apply economic factors and we\u2019re now a bit above 100% of the range, which is the first time we\u2019ve ever been above the top end of the range for a company as a whole. And I do think we\u2019re likely to continue to go higher than where we are today, if the economy does continue to soften.", "So I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a magic number that we have in mind there, but frankly I think when all the third quarter numbers are out I suspect we\u2019re going to have, again, a well above average coverage ratio of contemporaneous losses.", "And again, if you think about it, and we\u2019ve talked about it, a relatively high portion of our portfolio that is secured by collateral which does have value, means that the loss content in our NPAs, and other loan portfolio, is less than that of people who are doing consumer lending. We have a lot of loans that go to NPA in which we have a significant recovery eventually, whereas a lot of consumer loans don\u2019t go to NPA and go straight to loss. And so you\u2019ve got may banks with much higher charge-off levels than we do at 91 basis points.", "Harris Simmons", "I think an interesting thing to look at, if you look at 90 day and still accruing loans, ours are running about roughly 10% of NPAs. You are seeing a lot of the big banks with consumer portfolios that are running well over 100%. And that\u2019s a big difference in the kind of portfolio we have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "I\u2019m following up on an earlier question on Arizona. I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of where we are in the process of working these residential construction issues, maybe relative to California, where it just seems like you\u2019ve classified all the problems, taken some aggressive write-downs.", "Doyle Arnold", "Keith is the CEO of the bank in Arizona. I\u2019ll let him speak for himself.", "Keith Maio", "I guess where I would characterize where we are is a kind of a point of delineation between those that are going to make it and not make it, from a residential development and construction standpoint. And so the identification, I think, has become much clearer and I think now it\u2019s a matter of exit strategy, the quickest exit strategy we can find, for those that are not going to make it.", "So we have been aggressive in terms of marking those to what we think a market value is and our hope is that we have this clear delineation between those that are going to make it and not make it.", "Doyle Arnold", "I think during the quarter in a couple of investor presentations I have shown a slide that looks at the percentage of the residential construction and development portfolios in California and the distressed markets in California versus Las Vegas and in Arizona. And third quarter that percentage that was criticized and classified as non-performing in Arizona was quite a bit lower than those other markets. I don\u2019t have the exact number but it\u2019s much more comparable at the end of this quarter.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "In terms of the TARP plan, I think you mentioned in your remarks that you believe you will be invited to participate in the program. I was just curious, from your vantage point and your discussions with your bank supervisors, who do you believe will not be able to participate in the program? Particularly your comments with respect to acquisitions and perhaps a government-assisted transaction?", "Doyle Arnold", "That is clearly the $64,000 question. And I have would just say I have conflicting impressions from talking to different people about that. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that any bank that is expected to fail in the very near term is probably going to have a hard time. I\u2019m not sure but that\u2019s my sense. Where exactly that line is going to get drawn and how, I don\u2019t have a sense. I have talked to a rating agency and a regulator and others in the last two days and I have very different impressions from those conversations so I can\u2019t really help you.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "But I\u2019m assuming that perhaps your direct contacts have encouraged you to participate.", "Doyle Arnold", "They certainly haven\u2019t discouraged me.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And just secondarily to that, just in terms of if you could just tie together the changes in your funding and continuous planning that you did this quarter, how that is affecting your decision or your thought process as it relates to the FDIC liquidity program that you alluded to, and perhaps not wanting to opt in to that, if you will.", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, I didn\u2019t mean to imply that we didn\u2019t want to opt in. We just haven\u2019t decided. There\u2019s real questions that I don\u2019t have answers to as to just what it will apply to. But if you think about it, we did raise nearly $300.0 million of new capital in the third quarter. That capital is cash. At the minimum that we would be allowed to participate in the TARP, that\u2019s another roughly $500.0 million, so you\u2019re kind of looking at $800.0 million of cash raised in a pretty short time, at the minimum participation in TARP. And it goes up from there. ", "Compare that against how much debt do we actually have maturing in the next 2 or 3 years, and it becomes then a question of it would be nice to roll some of that debt out and push a couple of hundred million of maturities between now and June way out, in the current environment, just to further cushion and remove uncertainty. But it costs 75 basis points a year to do that. So the question is on what terms can you issue it given that cost and is it worth it given the pile of cash that we may well find ourselves sitting on by the end of this year.", "I didn\u2019t mean to imply that we wouldn\u2019t do it, it\u2019s just more of an open question than participation in the TARP capital program.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Do you have questions of how much leverage would be acceptable, in terms of how much you can really leverage this?", "Doyle Arnold", "I will ask you to clarify your question and then we have got to cut it off. What do you mean, leverage which? The capital?", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "No, just talking about the proceeds, the dollar figures you just ran through?", "Doyle Arnold", "Do you mean what are the new risk-based minimums, if you will, that the regulators?", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Correct.", "Doyle Arnold", "I keep hearing rumors that they\u2019re higher by 1% or 2% across the board. I have had no clear communication to that effect.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I was just zeroing more in on your tangible ratio, more than anything else.", "Harris Simmons", "I think the answer is simply in this environment everybody wants to have a much higher leverage ratio and capital ratios across the board. I don\u2019t think anybody has figured out whether this is going to find equilibrium yet.", "Doyle Arnold", "Every $500.0 million would add 100 basis points across the board to every capital ratio that we have. So you can kind of scale it that way. It moves the needle a lot in the upward direction.", "With that I think we should cut it off. I know it\u2019s getting very late back East and I appreciate all of your interest and perseverance. I know that it\u2019s hard for you guys to sort through all of this. The permutations and combinations are coming so fast now that there are days when it\u2019s hard for us to sort through them all. But I think, clearly, this TARP program is going to be a game changer in many respects and we don\u2019t probably appreciation all the dimensions of that yet. But the world will look different after that.", "So thank you very much.", "Operator", "This does conclude today\u2019s call.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Before we begin, the company has asked me to read the following statement. Today\u2019s presentation by management contains forward-looking statements with the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements represent the company\u2019s present expectations or beliefs concerning future events. The company cautions that such statements are necessarily based on certain assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated today.  These risk factors include changes in general economic conditions, recent geopolitical events, increased competition, work stoppages and slowdowns, exchange rate fluctuation, variations in the mix of products sold, fluctuations in effective pass through rates resulting from shifts or sources of income, and the ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses. Further information on these risk factors is included in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to the host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Clark Hinckley, Senior Vice President.", "Clark B. Hinckley", "Good evening everyone. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter of 2008 earnings. We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. If you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available in Adobe Acrobat format at www.zionsbankcorporation.com and can be easily downloaded and printed. We know that your time is limited and very valuable. We will limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions.", "I will now turn the time over to our Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Welcome to all of you. The past quarter was perhaps the most challenging quarter for the industry in our lifetimes. The quarter was marked by a significant decline in economic activity in almost every market and sector of the economy and by a great deal of turmoil in the banking industry.", "The quarter resulted in a loss for Zions Bancorporation. That was driven largely by non-cash goodwill impairment reflecting both conditions in the market for bank equities but also of lowered expectations for the performance of some of our subsidiaries in some of these difficult markets in the medium term.", "Additionally, the loss was caused by the write-down of impaired securities and of higher provisions for loan losses, including a $105.0 million increase in our reserve for future losses.", "This past quarter saw a meaningful decline in credit quality across the industry. We experienced continued deterioration in residential real estate credits in the Southwest. We also saw some weakening in other loan types in other geographies as the country continued to slide deeper into a recession.", "With the economy continuing to deteriorate in recent months, we focused a lot of attention on strengthening our balance sheet in the event that economic conditions get worse. ", "Our capital ratios are at or near record high levels. That\u2019s the result of not only receipt of TARP capital during the fourth quarter, but our own common and preferred capital raises in the third quarter. There is increasing focus on tangible common equity ratios and we believe that we are in relatively strong shape in this regard relative to many in the industry. ", "We came into this cycle with a great majority of our tier-1 capital consisting of common equity. In order to ensure that common equity remains strong through the remainder of this very difficult cycle we announced today an 88% reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.04 per share.", "We have essentially eliminated all net short-term borrowings and we have substantial unused borrowing capacity at both the Fed and the Home Loan Bank system, equal to about one-third of our entire deposit base. We have sufficient cash at the parent-company level to meet our needs for about two years so we have some strength there.", "Indeed, for all the challenges we are seeing in this environment, there are some real strengths. In addition to strong capital and liquidity positions, our margin remains one of the strongest in the industry and we are seeing improvements in credit spreads. And losses in the loan portfolio, while elevated, remain in better shape that we have generally seen around the industry.", "With that brief introduction, I am going to ask Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly numbers.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Harris has already hit the three big drivers of the bottom line results this quarter. The goodwill impairment, we wrote off all of the goodwill at our subsidiaries at Nevada State Bank, National Bank of Arizona, and Vectra Bank and all the goodwill at a small financial Tex-sub. Together those were $353.8 million, or accounted for $2.97 a share. We did recognize impairment losses and valuation losses on securities of $204.0 million, or $1.07 per share. ", "It\u2019s hard to know which analyst included what, but if you back out both of those two things, we lost about $0.32 a share for the quarter. I think if there was a consensus it was somewhere around that number, $0.30 to $0.32 loss for the quarter.", "Turning to some of the particulars now on page 11 of the attachments to the release, net interest income of $508.4 million actually increased at an annualized growth rate of over 13% from the prior quarter. In part this was driven by, at the bottom of that page, increase in the net interest margin of 7 basis points.", "The TARP Capital Purchase Program capital had a 1 basis point to 2 basis point favorable impact on the margin but most of it was driven by an increase in net interest spread.", "Again, back up in the top part of the page, the provision for loan losses, $285.2 million was $128.6 million higher than the prior quarter and $105.0 million in excess of net loan and lease charge-offs and it was driven by the decline in economic conditions that Harris referred to and which you have heard a lot about from other reporting banks in the quarter.", "And then finally you will see there the total impairment charge on goodwill of $353.8 million. On page 12 I\u2019ll just highlight a couple of additional numbers. Period end loans and leases of $41.94 million were essentially unchanged from the prior period, $41.98 million, but a lot of change was masked by that. ", "We had growth, as you will see in a moment, in C&I, consumer and commercial term real estate, and it was offset by pay-downs and charge-offs of other CRE loans, particularly residential construction and development.", "We actually originated $2.97 billion of gross new credits during the quarter. For those who want to know what we\u2019re doing with the TARP capital, are we lending it, we are certainly trying to.", "We also had substantial draw-downs on credit lines during the period, as well. Bu the net after pay-downs and charge-offs elsewhere was about flat.", "Just below that number you can see the resulting balance of goodwill of $1.72 billion, after the impairment charges that I just mentioned. Down from a little over $2.0 billion in the prior quarter. About $1.3 billion of what\u2019s left is in Amigy Bank in Texas and most, if not all, of the rest is at our California subsidiary.", "Turning to page 13, on the consolidated balance sheet, going to just focus on the liability section, because we are going to talk more about loans later. You will notice that DDA non-interest-bearing accounts did increase by about $270.0 million from period end to period end, over the quarter. Average DDA was up about $164.0 million, a little less than the period-to-period, but we saw growth during the quarter.", "The other big driver of the overall increase of deposits of $2.7 billion, as you can see, is growth in money market accounts, which does include some use of brokerage money market accounts, which we consciously did for two reasons. One, the brokered money market accounts were actually cheaper than our Internet money market accounts and we also consciously raised those to pay down Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and other wholesale borrowings and free up that backup liquidity capacity.", "Significantly then, Federal Home Loan advances and Fed auction borrowings were down $2.7 billion from September 30, 2008. You can see that about three-quarters of the way down the page under Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other one-year-or-less. You can also see that Fed Funds purchase have come down over the course of the last couple of quarters.", "Our short-term borrowings, which were $4.7 billion at September 30 actually peaked at about $6.8 billion during the middle of the third quarter, so we have undertaken a sustained and successful effort to reduce those long-term borrowings and improve liquidity during this uncertain economic environment. So we now have short-term liquid assets, cash, and money market instruments slightly in excess of our total wholesale borrowings and we have unused immediately available borrowing capacity at the Fed and Federal Home Loan Bank, as Harris said, to slightly over one-third of our total deposit base.", "At the bottom of the page I\u2019ll just note the preferred stock for the U.S. Treasury, $1.295 billion. We actually received $1.4 billion of TARP capital. Our valuation of the warrants that were attached to those led to a value of the preferred itself of $1.295 billion and then as you can see a couple of lines down, common stock has increased by about $105.0 million. There was $105.0 million of TARP value attributed to warrants included in the common stock line.", "Turning to page 14, the income statement, I\u2019m not going to highlight a lot. I\u2019ll just note that dividends and other investment income increased to about $16.0 million, driven primarily by BOLI income increasing over $4.0 million and an improvement in the earnings of Farmer Mac by about $6.0 million during the quarter. Despite this improvement in Farmer Mac, about four lines down under equity gains losses, we impaired the value of our holding in Farmer Mac stock. $11.0 million of that $14.0 million loss is writing down our Farmer Mac stock by $11.0 million, or about 50%, due to some of the stresses that that GSE has encountered during the quarter.", "Fair value and non-hedged derivative loss, as we suggested it might last quarter, narrowed from a $26.0 million loss to just under a $6.0 million loss. Non-hedged derivative income was actually positive as the spread between prime and LIBOR widened again. It moved in our favor, however we did record losses on FAS 159 securities and other items that drove this line to an overall net loss.", "You can see the OTTI impairment of $204.0 million is not hard to miss. I probably don\u2019t need to point that out to you.", "On the non-interest expense line, salaries and employee benefits declined significantly, about $18.0 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to reduced or reversed accruals for various incentive, variable pay, benefit plans.", "The other real estate expense this quarter was up significantly, $40.0 million, resulting from further write-downs of ORE some of which was disposed of, some of which were just further charged down.", "Total growth from fourth quarter this year compared to fourth quarter last year in non-interest expense was $45.0 million. If you net out the change in the ORE expense you get only $6.5 million of growth, or about 1.8% over the year. And most of that was driven by an increase in advertising expense this quarter and as we\u2019ve begun trying to advertise our willingness and ability and eagerness to lend to creditworthy borrowers primarily during the quarter.", "I would note that we have continued to take actions to reduce overall operating expenses. We have contracted to sell 51 grocery store branches in Utah and Nevada and those deposits for the most part will be consolidated into other free-standing branches. We are building a few new free-standing branches to offset those, but nowhere near the 51 that we have sold to another party.", "We have essentially effective the first of the year frozen base salaries for most mid-level and senior officers and executives in the company and are limiting overall increases for other employees to very modest levels and various incentive-based pay is being curtailed significantly around the company.", "If you go to page 16, changes in shareholders\u2019 equity and OCI, I\u2019ll only point out a couple of things there. In the bottom two sections of the page you can see that in the third column from the right, accumulated other comprehensive income, that number was a negative $157.0 million at September 30. It\u2019s a negative $99.0 million at year end. That\u2019s a net improvement of $58.0 million, which is reflected in GAAP common equity but does not have impact on risk-based capital measures.", "The big drivers there are the net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities which were negative offset by some other items there, $122.0 million improvement. We can come back and answer questions, I don\u2019t want to dwell on that, but there were some pretty big moving parts that net-net added about 11 basis points or 12 basis points to common equity.", "Pages 17 and 18, in response to questions and comments from last quarter, we have this quarter provided you with two versions of the schedule that breaks out our held to maturity and available for sale securities holdings. Over the last quarter or two, as you are aware, particularly happening in the fourth quarter, there is now a very wide divergence in ratings of a number of these securities by the various rating agencies.", "So we have given you two versions of the schedule, one to show you what we hold based on the highest rating, applicable to each security, and the other based on the lowest rating. That\u2019s page 18. The differences previously had been rather immaterial, but as I said there is a wide disparity at this point.", "We have also added a new column to these schedules to show you the starting point, the par value, instead of starting with a carrying value kind of number. So we are trying to improve the disclosure there. ", "There is a lot that we could go through there. I\u2019m going to not go through this in detail but what I do want to tell you is that of the OTTI that we recognized this quarter, if you want to put out page 17 in front of you, $141.0 million of it related to held to maturity A-rated securities. So on page 17 that would be the third line of numbers, the one that is $1.19 billion. ", "We impaired those securities by $141.0 million this quarter. We currently on average have an estimating fair value on those securities of 50%. 72% of the OTTI that we took this quarter were in tranches of those A-rated held to maturity securities.", "One line below that, $32.0 million, or 17% of the total OTTI charge, was related to the triple-B held to maturity securities. ", "The next biggest tranche was down in available for sale under the A-rated real estate investment trusts. We impaired those by another $9.0 million and are now carrying them at $6.0 million. That\u2019s about 40%, I guess, of par.", "Overall, the re-trust preferred securities we are now carrying at 11% of par but that is after disposing selling a significant dollar amount of re-trust preferred securities that previously were being carried at $0.01 to $0.03 on the dollar and we sold them for a couple of tens of thousands of dollars, primarily so that we could realize the tax loss. It was $80.0 million of par value and we sold it for $20,000 so we could recognize the tax loss and that\u2019s why the overall REITs came down a lot. But also why the average remaining price went up slightly, as a percent of par.", "I would like to give you some metrics on how we approach the valuation. As we have discussed with you in the past, there are two big drivers of how we value these securities, particularly those in determining OTTI. One is probability of default and the other is the discount rate we use on the cash flows.", "So I am going to give you some metrics on both. On probabilities of default, we obtain these from third parties. Kamakura for those that are publicly rated and we use LACE ratings to map to the Kamakura default probabilities for the ones that aren\u2019t.", "We have now, after acquisitions and what-not, we had a total exposure universe of 994 banks that we\u2019re holding exposure to. In 2008 14 of the banks to which we had exposure failed. Our analysis had predicted 19 so we were conservative by about a quarter in our analysis in 2008, just on failures alone.", "Cumulatively, from 2008 through 2009, our analysis is assuming that 106 banks to which we have exposure are defaulted, or 10.6% of our universe. For five years, that is through 2013, it leads you to 164 banks defaulting, or 16.5%, and over the lifetime a 30-year default probability of 246 banks, or just under 25% of our exposure universe.", "Defaulting banks determine whether or not a security is OTTI. Once it is deemed OTTI we do the cash-flow waterfalls, etc. and we apply a discount rate that is after the credit stressing has already been done. And to just give you a feel for that, for the first 10 years of cash flows, for A-rated securities we are using a discount rate of LIBOR plus 9.75% and for triple-Bs a discount rate of LIBOR plus 13%. For triple-As it\u2019s less and so forth.", "And again I want to stress that this is after credit defaults. Some of the discount rates that have been disclosed by others we believe are being applied without regard to whether or not the cash flows have already been credit stressed. If you simply take the written down value of our securities and determine a yield to maturity to get them back to par at a maturity date, our discount rates are significantly higher than those disclosed. And we can take questions on that later if you wish.", "Now, that said, our analysis suggests, as it had in the past, that we may well take further impairments on this portfolio if default probabilities continue to rise, including deterioration and LACE ratings and if there are changes in these discount rates.", "In Harris\u2019s presentation tomorrow at the Citigroup Investor Conference, which we will file as an 8-K, within the next hour or two, we will disclose some stress test analyses showing you the impact of different assumptions, stressing probabilities of default, etc. that could result in a range of additional OTTI over the next few quarters of $150.0 million to $450.0 million.", "Turning now to credit quality. We are going to look on page 19. I will just point out that the total non-performing assets increased to 2.71% of loans in REO. NPAs in the National Bank of Arizona actually declined due to sales and substantial charge-offs. But we saw increases in NPAs in several other banks, including Zions Bank.", "The net charge-offs were $179.7 million for the quarter, or annualizing that quarter it was a 1.71% annualized rate. That fourth quarter charge-off ratio is about the industry average in the third quarter. If you take our charge-off ratio for the year, it was about 0.96%. Based on the announcements we have been able to analyze to date we think that when all the results are in our charge-off rate this quarter will still be significantly below the weighted average charge-off rate for the industry.", "The bulk of the charge-offs occurred in commercial real estate loans, primarily residential land development and construction and primarily in Arizona and Nevada, 67% combined. California Bank & Trust, which had about 19% of the loan portfolio, accounted for only 10% of the charge-offs. ", "As I think Harris mentioned, we do continue to build reserves in this environment, adding $105.0 million to the provision in excess of charge-offs and at the end of the quarter the allowance, compared to loans and leases, was 1.64% and 1.76% if you add in the unfunded lending commitment reserves.", "On to page 20, just show you that, again, the loan growth was primarily first in commercial and industrial lending. There was also some growth in commercial term. It\u2019s new commitments there and then you had significant pay-downs and charge-offs of construction and development and commercial real estate. And you can also see a pretty significant uptick in home equity credit line draws in the quarter. I will note that the delinquency performance that will be in the Citi presentation that we will file tonight remains remarkably good. A slight uptick but still very low delinquencies.", "The net interest margin, on page 21, bottom of the page, you can see the spread increased 6 basis points the margin, 7 basis points the difference as I mentioned earlier is primarily due to the TARP capital. And then I would note that we believe that we are asset-sensitive at this point. It\u2019s very hard to engage in the kind of sustained hedging that, given the aberrant behavior of prime versus LIBOR and other things that we have in the past, also the fact that it\u2019s very hard to see prime lowering anymore, given Fed Funds at near zero. But we think we are asset-sensitive at this point.", "On page 23, there are a couple of things that I want to point out. Tangible common equity ratio, I know there has been a lot of focus on that, 5.89%, down slightly. Third quarter is actually up almost 20 basis points from one year ago. That primarily reflects the issuance of $250.0 million of common by the company in the third quarter. ", "The risk-based capital measures reflect mostly the TARP capital. And finally, at the bottom of that page, since we focused in the beginning of the press release on some non-GAAP numbers, we give you the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP, both on a dollar- and an EPS-basis.", "I would just like to mention a couple of things not in the schedules and the release but may be of interest to you given announcements that others have made.", "Lockhart Funding at year end had total assets of $738.0 million and the fair value of those assets was $119.0 million less than book value. The fair value mark is for information only and does not appear on the balance sheet or the income statement of either Lockhart of Zions. Again, it only becomes meaningful if and when we have to buy a security out of Lockhart because of a downgrade or other reasons.", "During the quarter we did purchase one security from Lockhart with a book value of $78.3 million. We recognized a loss of $7.9 million on that security, which is included in the $204.0 million of impairment loss and valuation losses on securities.", "If, and we don\u2019t anticipate this, but if Lockhart were included on our balance sheet in its entirety, the impact on tangible capital ratios would be about 17 basis points. And as noted in the press release, we sort of stabilized the funding or financing of Lockhart by participating in the commercial paper funding facility program that is run by the Fed.", "We did last week issue just under $255.0 million of floating rate senior notes at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 37 basis points, due in June of 2012. This was under the FDIC\u2019s temporary liquidity guarantee program and with the placement of those notes, we estimate that the parent company has cash to cover all its obligations for about two years.", "We have taken a number of actions including that and the TARP capital and the repayment of Federal Home Loan and Fed borrowings to strengthen liquidity significantly, both at the parent and the bank level over the last few months.", "So, summary of guidance, it\u2019s very hard to give guidance in this very uncertain environment but we will do our best.", "Loan growth, we are actively seeking to extend new credit to creditworthy borrowers and we have had some success in growing loan originations. However, in the current environment pay-downs, charge-offs, and other reductions are likely to largely offset originations so we expect residential construction development balances to continue to decline, others to increase, and the result to be relatively flat.", "Deposit growth may also be moderate, modest over the near term but we do continue to look at bidding on the deposits of failed banks.", "With regard to the margins, loan spreads are improving. The deposit market remains competitive. We are, we believe, asset-sensitive. It\u2019s hard to figure out what that means for the margin. Perhaps stable to slightly up. But it really depends on a lot of things.", "FDIC premium expense should increase from about $20.0 million in 2008 to $59.0 million in 2009.", "With regard to credit quality, conditions we think will continue to soften in most markets for the next couple of quarters and residential land and home prices will continue to decline somewhat in Arizona, Nevada, and some other markets.", "NPA is likely to increase modestly. The rate of increase has been trending downward in NPAs. We hope that that will continue. Can\u2019t promise it but there has been a slight tail off, partly due to increased charge-offs. ", "Charge-off provisions are likely to remain somewhat elevated. I don\u2019t know that they will be as high as fourth quarter but it\u2019s hard to tell at this point. We have built reserves in this quarter with continued weakness in mind and are likely to continue to build reserves over the next couple of quarters.", "With regard to securities, we do believe, as I already indicated, there could be some additional OTTI during the quarter.", "With regard to goodwill impairment, I have told you where the most of it is. We will probably be looking at goodwill on a quarterly basis, not waiting for our annual date, which is October 1. In fact, we looked both at October 1 and did further impairment at December 31 of goodwill this quarter reflecting declines in bank stock prices and general weakness in the market. I think it\u2019s possible that goodwill impairment at Amigy and/or California Bank & Trust could occur. I can\u2019t say for sure that it will but we will have to be looking at that.", "We note that our capital ratios are near historic levels. Historic meaning probably as high as they\u2019ve been in at least the last decade on most measures. We think we are well positioned for the quarter ahead, which we do expect that that quarter and probably the one or two after it, will remain rather challenging.", "I\u2019ve tried to walk you through the highlights and probably some additional detail beyond the highlights. We will pause now and try to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan", "Doyle, could we start with the dividend. It was $0.33, $0.32, now $0.04. What is the methodology that is being used to set the dividend? Is it a payout ratio? What are you thinking about there?", "Doyle Arnold", "I think at the minimum that we want to make sure we think we can cover the dividend out of earnings to common at least after netting after non-cash and/or truly extraordinary items, like goodwill impairment and maybe some of the OTTI. Things that we don\u2019t think will go on forever. They may not be a one-time charge but there\u2019s a sort of a finite nature to those things.", "So the reduction and then the additional reduction, I think reflects our deteriorating outlook for the company and generally for the industry and the economy as a whole. There\u2019s nothing particularly unique to us. We are trying to assure that we don\u2019t pay out more than we are earning and that we are conserving common equity in a very uncertain environment.", "Harris, do you want to add anything to that?", "Harris Simmons", "No, I think there\u2019s a limit to the science you can apply to it. I think it\u2019s clearly a substantial reduction but not an elimination.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan", "Looking at page 18, what would explain the difference in the estimated fair value of the bank and insurance TruPS? If you look at held to maturity and then available for sale. Like if I look at the single-A, valued at 46% of par and held to maturity, but 78% in available for sale. Why would they be different?", "Doyle Arnold", "You\u2019re talking about the $124.0 million compared to the $268.0 million. And then under the bank TruPS, the $136.0 million compared to the $175.0 million. ", "We cash flow each of those securities, each of the tranches and each of those buckets differently. We are applying the same discount rate to those cash flows based on that rating. We are doing our own default probabilities, not using Moody\u2019s or Fitch\u2019s or S&P. as I told you where ours come from. So basically what it says is that not all As are the same. As rated by, in this case these are mostly Fitch. In our estimation. Some As are created better than other As at this point.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan", "How much are the charge-offs are related to that Flying J and do you have any left?", "Harris Simmons", "It is not in the charge-off numbers. It has been reasonably heavily reserved. But at this point we believe it is premature to be charging it off. The loan is actually current, at the end of the year. ", "It\u2019s a company that has had a very strong cash flow for the first three quarters of this past year. It was a Chapter 11 filing that arose out of another [inaudible] investment drops and commodity prices and not as a result of a fundamental breakdown in the business. Their primary business is actually running the largest chain of truck stop kind of travel plazas in the United States. They are the largest distributor of diesel fuel, we believe, in the United States. And we are actually at this point still reasonably optimistic that we will see a successful restructuring and work out of this credit.", "As we learn more we will continue to assess the credit but it remains on the books.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan", "How big is the position you hold?", "Doyle Arnold", "It is slightly under $50.0 million. It is all on non-accrual and as Harris mentioned, it\u2019s got a pretty hefty reserve against it but it\u2019s not been charged off and it\u2019s all current at the moment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Abbot - Friedman Billings Ramsey.", "James Abbot - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Can you go through your outlook on expenses? One of the things that was pretty volatile in there this quarter was the REO expense and as a percentage of REO holdings, at least from the third quarter REO, it was pretty high, 25%, 26%. What is your take there? What is your outlook? Were those some old properties that you finally just threw in the towel and sold or what are we looking at from that perspective? And also on comp, kind of a run rate there.", "Doyle Arnold", "I think at this point that that line is likely to be more volatile than it has in the past. Our practice when we move a property in REO is to get a current appraisal and then haircut that anywhere from 12% to 20%, depending on the market, the nature of the property, etc. And we take a charge down at that point, as we book it.", "If there are further appraisals that reduce value or sale of the property at less than the current value it then results in an additional charge down. In the quarter, in Arizona we did sell a number of properties. We got new bids on some others that we didn\u2019t take but led to some additional charge-downs of properties and I would guess that that attempt to accelerate the disposition or recognition of loss on some of the exposures in Arizona drove most of that rather larger charge this quarter.", "Harris Simmons", "We had about $64.0 million in sales of both notes as well as real estate in Arizona and it does reflect the fact that the property values there have continued to plummet and they are getting down to points that they almost have to slow because they\u2019re down to, in a lot of cases, less than $0.20 on the dollar from when the loans were made. But that\u2019s where they are.", "James Abbot - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "And on the compensation expense, do you expect that to bounce back up a little bit? How much was the reversal of accrued incentive compensation and so forth?", "Doyle Arnold", "This quarter was not a lot of reversal. But I guess there was some reversal of annual bonus accruals that was $5.0 million to $10.0 million. Norm?", "Norm Bellon", "I think it was closer to $10.0 million.", "Doyle Arnold", "Probably closer to $10.0 million of reversals. And we reversed the number of incentive comp and other accruals in each of the prior two quarters as well. I would guess in the first quarter it should pop up a bit simply because we are back to FICA and Medicare withholding for all employees. And it will take longer to get to the point where some people have hit their maximum simply because there are going to be the same bonus levels being paid in the first quarter of this year that there were in the first quarter last year, across a pretty broad swath of executives and senior management. ", "I would think over the course of the year that salary and benefit line, the increase is going to be driven more by health care benefits being up 3% or 4% than it will be by base salaries being up 3% or 4%.", "James Abbot - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "The FDIC assessment, the FDIC cost in the fourth quarter versus what you expected for 2009?", "Doyle Arnold", "What\u2019s in that run rate? Why don\u2019t we take another question while we look that up? And then we will interject that answer if we can find here.", "James Abbot - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "That\u2019s all for my expense questions and I will leave it at that and let everybody else ask the rest.", "Doyle Arnold", "This quarter, fourth quarter of 2008, the FDIC expense included on the income statement was about $6.0 million. So that\u2019s a run rate of $24.0 million for the year but it\u2019s going to be up $59.0 million. So it\u2019s going to somewhat more than double, from a run rate standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On your TruPS portfolio, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably seen some of the write-downs that a number of other banks have taken. I think Webster most recently wrote it\u2019s everything A-rated and below down to about $0.17 on the dollar from par value. Can you talk about where you see the biggest differences there? Is either Webster being way too aggressive, or, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the difference between, I think it\u2019s roughly 75% if I did my math right, on your portfolio versus some of the other marks at other banks.", "Doyle Arnold", "We don\u2019t know the methodology that Webster used. We did see their announcement. That actually caused us to go take a real hard look at what we did. I will explain a couple of possible differences and you can make your own judgment.", "I\u2019ve told you where we got our default probabilities and what numbers are in there that lead you to, we are in effect saying that over the life 25% of the banks to which we have exposure will fail. That\u2019s a pretty hefty haircut. We have talked with one other bank, I won\u2019t tell you which one, and we don\u2019t think their numbers are radically different on that basis.", "But the bank failures get you to which securities are OTTI. Then you get to what discount rate do you apply. There are two things that drive the discount rate. In our methodology one is the rating of the security and the other is whether or not you include credit losses. You assume those have already been recognized or not. If you applied the lowest rating by any agency and used the discount rates that we are using implied by those difference in ratings, we would have recognized about $60.0 million to $80.0 million more OTTI this quarter than we did.", "Consistent with last quarter, we used the higher of the two ratings on Swift ratings. But if you want roughly the impact had we used the other.", "The other difference is you\u2019re going to get to, okay, give it a rating or whatever, what\u2019s the appropriate discount rate? The ratings being quoted by one of the most widely-used sources, from which these discount rates are obtained, are yields to maturity, basically they include credit loss exposure as well as liquidity discount. We believe that some parties have used those discount rates and we do not believe that is the appropriate methodology. We are using a slighter lower discount rate that we believe is appropriate, after you assume the defaults in the portfolio. And I\u2019ve told you we\u2019re assuming 25% defaults over the lifetime of these securities.", "So those we think are perhaps the two bigger sources of explanation and the latter one probably more important than the former one in what you ultimately get to.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So just as a follow-on to that, is there any way to help us try to get a better sense of ultimate write-downs, because I guess what we have seen the last quarter or so has been, I think you started out with a roughly $100.0 million to $200.0 million estimate for losses, and you do give us a very thorough explanation of how you developed that loss estimate. And that went from roughly $100.0 million to $200.0 million to $200.0 million to $400.0, and then obviously you take this loss plus another $200.0 million to $400.0 million I think it was, or $450.0 million. So now we\u2019re up to sort of $400.0 million to $600.0 million. Can you talk about the main drivers of the sequential increases in your loss assessment? Is it the LACE rating changes?", "Doyle Arnold", "I\u2019m going to preface this with a comment that I don\u2019t want to sound flip because it\u2019s not, but we have looked in vain for the FASB pronouncement that allows you to let\u2019s just put it all behind us. And mark it down to nothing and be done with it.", "We think that we have to do this sequentially and incrementally based on the information that we have or can project, so yes, there have been three different drivers of the incrementally worsening OTTI and some of the deterioration in the outlook.", "One is the Kamakura and most other default probability services, including Moody\u2019s, KMB, I\u2019m not sure about some of the others, but those two for sure base their PDs on a number of variables but two of the biggest drivers are the level and volatility of the stock price of the underlying names.", "Well, it\u2019s no secret that over the last year and even over the last quarter and even over the last weeks, the level has gone down and the volatility has generally trended upward. With the exception of a brief period in the third quarter, it certainly hasn\u2019t gotten any better. So those have driven the default probabilities that we have obtained on the 40% or so of our names progressively higher.", "The LACE ratings, which we get on all the banks but they become relevant on the non-public banks, have also deteriorated. Those come out with a slightly over one-quarter lag. When we first did the OTTI analysis this quarter we only had June 30 LACE ratings available. We actually did re-run it in January after getting the September 30 ones. It made not much difference in the aggregate so we were pretty comfortable with that. But there was deterioration in the LACE ratings.", "The reason it didn\u2019t make that much difference is that we already assigned pretty high default probabilities to LACE D- and E-rated banks and there was not a lot of new migration from A, B, and C into the D or E category. There was migration from D to E but net-net it didn\u2019t have that much difference. But there may be some further deterioration in LACE ratings and Kamakura default probabilities this quarter.", "The other is that the discount rates, particularly through last year, were deteriorating. I would say net-net the discount rates we are using aren\u2019t that much different this quarter than last quarter.", "But those are the three big drivers. So what we are going to file and it will be available very shortly are some sensitivities, again assuming that all PDs on every bank we are exposed to increased by 20%, like the 20% defaults go to 24%, etc. We\u2019re going to give you that one. We\u2019re going to give you one on assuming all the D and E LACE rated banks fail and nothing else does and it happened this quarter, first quarter, what would that do. That\u2019s kind of all we can do to guide you at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "Just a follow-up, the $150.0 million to $450.0 million of possible OTTI, is that a backward-looking view or did you take a forward-looking view in terms of where these LACE ratings and discount rates may go?", "Harris Simmons", "You\u2019re talking about the stress testing. That would be if those assumptions that we are going to spell out came to play. It\u2019s not a backward-looking.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "And of that $150.0 million to $450.0 million how much would be held to maturity versus available for sale? Or what would be the capital impact?", "Doyle Arnold", "We haven\u2019t had time to break that out.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "And if you look at trust preferred, bank and insurance available for sale, estimated fair value, actually increased from $630.0 million last quarter to $660.0 million this quarter, can we get a sense of what drove the increase?", "If I\u2019m on page 17, available for sale, bank and insurance, trust preferreds of $660.0 million, estimated fair value, as I looked at the third quarter release, that number would be $630.0 million.

I\u2019m wondering, hearing your comments about your uncertainty of provisions up or down, do you just get a sense of where you think the reserve needs to go, generally speaking, and given the incremental comments about deterioration in some of those other markets that maybe hadn\u2019t turned as much to date?", "Doyle Arnold", "I don\u2019t know that we have a target level in mind for the reserves to total loans. I would guess it\u2019s probably going to increase by 20 basis points to 40 basis points more over the course of the year. It could be more than that.", "And the deterioration we are talking about in other markets, compared to what we\u2019ve seen in the Southwest residential real estate, I mean, we\u2019re not talking about that kind of deterioration. In the grand scheme of things I would characterize it as still fairly modest. ", "And with the oil prices in Texas having bounced off the low and the high to mid-30s back up into the upper-40s, they\u2019ve gone through their energy portfolio pretty finely here in the last few weeks and are reasonably comfortable that there\u2019s only one or two potential problems that they can identify. ", "We are just kind of reflecting a pretty high degree of caution given that the economy still has a very uncertain but generally downward path, it appears to us.", "Harris, do you want to comment otherwise?", "Harris Simmons", "I think that\u2019s right. Clearly, if you look at commercial mortgage-backed securities as a proxy for things, I think we expect that we will see more strain in non-residential commercial real estate. We don\u2019t expect it to become anywhere nearly as bad as what we\u2019ve seen in residential.", "We think, particularly in the middle market, kind of lower end of that market, you didn\u2019t have the same kind of craziness going on, but we are certainly seeing more stress in the retailing sector and office, etc. And we think that that will show some fraying but we don\u2019t see anything in the numbers at this point that would suggest that the bottom is going to fall out.", "I think likewise, we talk about Texas energy, we have gone through that portfolio. The expiration production kind of portfolio, where we are supporting producers. We think that looks actually quite good. There have been a lot of production hedges, which is going to help for the next couple of years with these producers to lock in higher prices and let them amortization debt.", "Lower levels of capital expenditure by the producers, and that\u2019s going to hurt some of the service companies that service the big production companies, but even there I think we don\u2019t expect it to be really awful. There\u2019s still really quite a lot of activity going on. ", "Most producers have are trying to cut back to capital expenditure programs that kind of mirror their cash flow. They\u2019re not doing a lot of borrowing, which we actually view as a good thing. And so we think there will be some slow down but they also come into with very strong balance sheets because they have seen a lot of strong activity in the last couple of years.", "Rig count today, it has retreated from where it was back from, say September of 2008, but it is not expected to get nearly as bad as it was, say back in the 80s, at this point.", "Kenneth Usdin - Banc of America Securities", "On the margin you had alluded to the fact that the company now feels like it is asset-sensitive. With rates coming down as much as they had in the fourth quarter, I was a little surprised to see the margin actually moving up relative to the movements of deposit costs and asset yields. Can you walk us through a little more of your confidence that the margin can hold up here as opposed as fall subject to that repricing on the asset side?", "Doyle Arnold", "One of the reasons this has become far more difficult to hedge is that we are increasingly getting floors that are sticking on a lot of loans, which has supported the margin in the last quarter. We have a couple of banks that have a discretionary prime that is not tied to New York prime or Wall Street prime and they have been able to not lower prime as aggressively as the New York banks were cajoled into doing by the Fed it would appear.", "And so there are a number of moving parts on the asset side that give us some belief. And the fact is that there can almost, by definition, be no\u2014the New York prime is more or less tied to the target Fed Funds rate and that just can\u2019t go any lower. It\u2019s zero and 25 basis points now.", "The other thing that we\u2019ve had to do is that a number of our interest rate swap hedges have become ineffective. Given all the aberrant price behavior and we have had to tear them up. Which means that more of the assets on the asset side of the balance sheet are now in effect floating rate again, but with floors. So just our best judgment is that we are now asset-sensitive, that the yields won\u2019t come down that much more from here and if there is any uptick in interest rates that yields will go up.", "Out of deference to the lateness of the hour, we will not take more questions. But if there are follow-up questions, as always Clark will be around to answer them and Harris will be speaking tomorrow morning. His presentation will include some additional trending information on 30-day-and-over delinquencies, some of the stuff that we have discussed on the OTTI securities valuation, etc.", "With that I want to thank you all for your attention in a very difficult quarter and we will look forward to talking to you again three months from now.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Isha and I will be your operator for today.  At this time all participants are in listen only mode.  We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference.  (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Clark Hinckley, Director of Investor Relations.", "Clark Hinckley", "We welcome you to our quarterly conference call.  I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially from those statements.  We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.  We will be referring in the course of our call to several schedules that are in the press release.", "If you do not yet have a copy of the press release it is available as an Adobe Acrobat file on our website at www.ZionsBancorporation.com.  It can be easily downloaded and printed.  I\u2019ll now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "The most significant driver of the loss we experienced this quarter was the non-cash impairment of goodwill of nearly $634 million.  All of this relates to our 2005 acquisition of Amegy Bank of Texas.  The impairment charge primarily reflects declines in market values of peer banks in Texas and the weak economic outlook in that state with the decline in energy prices that we\u2019ve seen in recent months.", "This impairment represents just over half of the total goodwill related to Amegy.  Amegy Bank\u2019s financial performance actually remains pretty strong despite weakening economic conditions in Texas and we don\u2019t expect that we\u2019ll need to recognize additional impairment unless conditions weaken substantially further.  We also recognized significant impairment and valuation losses on securities including securities purchased from Lockhart Funding as previously disclosed.", "These fair value marks were driven by a continued decline in the market capitalization of banks which underlie our trust preferred CDOs combined with higher discount rates reflecting continued uncertainty surrounding the marketability of securities.", "It\u2019s notable that none of the Lockhart securities which were purchased this quarter or for that matter others that we have previously purchased have ever missed a payment and they continue to pay on schedule something we expect will continue to be the case.  Gross OTTI securities losses were down about a third from the fourth quarter while net recognized securities OTTI losses dropped to roughly 75% in the first quarter.", "We also recognized valuation losses as noted on the securities purchased from Lockhart in an amount equal to $182 million.  This is the last quarter in which we expect to meaningfully discuss Lockhart as we expect that its remaining assets will be fully consolidated during the second quarter with very little in additional valuation losses or capital impact.", "The provision for loan losses increased about $12 million from the previous quarter and net charge offs actually decreased about $28 million as compared to the fourth quarter.  We expect that both the provision and losses will remain elevated for a few quarters but that our losses will continue to be well below industry levels.", "Finally we are pleased that our balance sheet remains very strong in terms of both liquidity and capital.  We have about $3 billion of cash and short term investments and sufficient unused borrowing capacity to replace about one third of our total deposits on very short notice.  We have sufficient cash at the parent company level to meet our needs for about two years.", "Our TCE ratio even after the losses this quarter is about 5.26% and regulatory capital ratios remain high and we believe that the volume of TCE ratio this quarter was larger than we are likely to see in the future.  So from a balance sheet perspective we believe we have ample capacity to absorb the losses that would be reflected in a prolonged recession if necessary.", "For all the challenges we\u2019re seeing in this environment there is some good news in the quarterly results.  In addition to maintaining strong capital and liquidity we\u2019ve eliminated about half of the entire goodwill on the books in the last two quarters.  We\u2019ve essentially liquidated Lockhart and for the first time in several quarters we\u2019ve seen both the provision and net charge offs level off.", "With that brief introduction to our results this quarter I\u2019ll ask our Chief Financial Office and Vice Chairman Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly performance.", "Doyle Henry Simmons", "I think the total results for the quarter were a loss of $832 million or $7.29 a share.  As Harris mentioned $5.55 and $634 million of that was the non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to Amegy where we basically wrote down a little over 50% of the goodwill associated with the purchase of Amegy.", "I would just emphasize that that was entirely due to the decline in the market values of other banks in Texas during the quarter and also the lack of any M&A activity in Texas not due to any fundamental decline in current or expected performance of Amegy.  Harris has already hit the other high points I think or low points if you will, but I would emphasize that Lockhart, this is the last we\u2019re going to see valuation losses of any kind related to Lockhart.", "There will be a few million, no more than $5 million, I think associated with the clean up of Lockhart and as a result of the Moody\u2019s downgrade of Zions today I think after the markets close, and some of you may have seen it, the expectation that Lockhart will be fully consolidated is now a certainty.  It is now very definitely in a liquidation mode.  This is the last quarter that we will be talking about Lockhart in any meaningful way.", "With that I\u2019m going to turn to Page 14 of the schedules attached to the press release.  This is the consolidated balance sheet and in the March 31 column I want to call to your attention a new subcategory of loans, it should be about a third of the way down the page, there\u2019s a line item under Loans called FDIC Supported Assets $836.5 million.", "These are loans that were acquired in association with Alliance Bank, a failed bank in Southern California.  That is the fair value of those loans.  There is no loan loss reserve associated with those loans.  They have been fully marked to our estimated fair value which includes our estimated loss on the portfolio in its entirety net of the expected loss sharing recoveries from the FDIC.", "As we\u2019ll discuss later about an eighth of those loans are non-accruing but again they are booked at fair value with no loan loss reserve but with 80% below a certain threshold of 95% above that threshold loss sharing by the FDIC.  Net of that addition loan growth for the quarter despite continued effort to originate loans was actually negative due to pay downs and charge offs of existing loans.", "In the Liability section note the very strong performance of DDA.  It increased over $800 million period end to period end since year end and a bit over $1 billion since a year ago.  Total deposits grew about $2 billion during the period with growth in most of the positive categories and then finally I\u2019ll note that a little further down the page Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other borrowings declined from $2 billion to a rather de minim is $429 million.", "That\u2019s down from over $5 billion at the end of June of 2008.  The company if you take into account the money market investments is now in a net long position of several billion dollars has paid off essentially all wholesale short term borrowings and has unused borrowing capacity at the FED and the Federal Home Loan Banks in total equal to about a third of the total deposit base.", "We have consciously in this uncertain environment built up a very liquid position something we will talk more about again when we come to the margin which did suffer because of that decision on our part.  On the next page, Consolidated Statement of Income, I will simply note under non-interest income that both fair value non-hedged derivative income as well as equity securities, gains and losses showed meaningful improvement quarter-over-quarter.", "The two biggest impacts were obviously valuation losses on securities purchased and OTTI.  The valuation losses on securities purchased really came from two parts as noted in the press release.  They\u2019re are about $182 million associated with the purchase from Lockhart Securities of triple A and double A rated securities that were deeply downgraded by Moody\u2019s late in the quarter.  ", "That was $182 million as I said and the rest of it $19 million was a voluntary repurchase on part of the company and several of its subsidiaries of all auction rate securities of various types held by it customers that had been sold to those customers.  The securities were purchased at PAR and we booked them at estimated fair value which was a slight haircut.", "Since there are no more such securities to repurchase and since Lockhart is for all intents and purposes behind us we do not expect a continuation of this kind of loss in future quarters.  As I said the loss in the second quarter is probably going to be on the order of magnitude of $4 million or $5 million to wrap up Lockhart during the quarter.", "The impairment losses on investment securities has been changed in its presentation in accordance with the new guidance out of the FASB again I guess it actually came out after the end of the quarter but with adoption during the first quarter allowed and then recasting of prior years\u2019 results also allowed.  So we show the gross impairment losses of $131.9 million significantly improved as Harris mentioned from $196.5 million in the prior quarter.", "We net out of that the liquidity discount of $82 million so the income statement impact is $49 million from the OTTI this quarter.  The remainder of that goes to OCI and we will turn to that page in a moment.  In non-interest expense note that salaried employee benefits is actually down $5 million from the same quarter last year because of FICA patterns during the course of the year.", "That\u2019s the best comparison that that number is actually down and the FTE count is approximately flat from the same quarter last year despite the fact that we\u2019ve done two acquisitions during that period.  Other real estate expense which spiked up last quarter to $40 million is down to $18.3 million this quarter.  That\u2019s important because that line is sort of a rough and ready measure of how realistic we\u2019re being about the carrying values of things that go into OREO.", "If it takes us longer to dispose of them it costs more, we have to take further haircuts after a property has gone into OREO.  That\u2019s where it shows up and that number is still higher than we would like.  It doesn\u2019t indicate that OREO is being fairly realistically valued.  Note also then that FDIC premiums increased from a run rate of $5 million to $6 million to $14 million this quarter.", "The expectation is that the run rate going forward will be about $15 million per quarter for the remainder of this year and that excludes the impact of any possible one time assessment from the FDIC.  I guess the latest information is that if there is such an assessment it might be in the range of 10 basis points.  That would be about $41 million for us and as I said, that\u2019s outside the run rate.", "Turning to Page 16 the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders\u2019 Equity and Comprehensive Income.  As I mentioned the new FASB pronouncements with regard to fair value of securities permitted or required, I forget which, reclassifying prior results upon adoption.  This $137.5 million increase in retained earnings and a corresponding decrease in OCI reflects the re-categorization of those two item from OTTI losses taken starting in the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2008.", "It\u2019s essentially taking that liquidity discount and putting back into retained earnings.  The other items there, note there\u2019s a $96.3 million negative and a $28 million positive.  The net of those two numbers is $65.5 million.  That\u2019s a result of new fair value marks on securities and then the next line, the negative $49.9 million is the after tax impact on capital of the $82.9 million non-credit related losses or liquidity discount related to the OTTI expense on the prior page.", "So the $82.9 million is $49.9 million after tax.  The next couple of pages present the same kind of detail that we\u2019ve shown you in the past with regard to the securities portfolio.  There are again two schedules.  The first one on Page 17 gives you the highest current rating and the one on Page 18 gives you the lowest current rating as of quarter end and reflects all of the downgrades that were done very late in the quarter by Moody\u2019s.", "The PAR value I would just note on the first column is not the face value of the security, but it\u2019s the remaining value that full payment of the security on its terms would give us.  In some cases it\u2019s already below face value because of pay downs and so forth.  I\u2019m not going to go through these schedules in detail.", "I will just note that in our Investor presentations last quarter we gave various stress test assumptions that would result in OTTI charges ranging from $150 million to $450 million.  This quarter we actually realized $131.9 million although under the new accounting treatment $82.9 million of that was non-credit related and didn\u2019t go to the income statement.", "So I mentioned this is down from the $196 million in the fourth quarter.  One of the primary drivers of these marks is the market value of the underlying banks in our bank trust preferred CDO portfolio because as those market values become depressed it increases the default probability of those banks or alternatively reflects increased default probability and as you know during the first quarter bank stock prices pretty much across the board fell dramatically.", "Any improvement going forward in bank stock prices could have the affect of lowering the default probability on the banks in our securities which would in turn translate to lower OTTI going forward.  I would simply note in terms of actual defaults the actual rate of bank failures thus far in 2009 is consistent with or probably even somewhat lower than the default rate that\u2019s assumed in our CDO valuations.", "Turning to Page 19, Credit Quality, I will note first of all that non-accrual loans did increase significantly this quarter.  Other real estate owned less so and then there\u2019s a new line item on this page also called FDI supported assets of $106.9 million.  That\u2019s the portion of the $800 and some odd million that I mentioned earlier on the balance sheet that is currently non-accrual so it\u2019s a subset of that $800 million.", "Again it\u2019s carried here at fair value as estimated at the time of the close.  The increase in NPLs, the biggest single driver was construction and land development loans.  That was about $260 million of the total increase including the biggest single pot was $160 million of those kinds of loans in Nevada and Arizona.  There was some uptick in non-residential CRE NPLs but I don\u2019t have the specifics for you yet today.  We just know there was some uptick there.", "Owner occupied commercial loans.  These are commercial loans, small business loans that are collateralized as a secondary source of repayment by owner occupied real estate.  That contributed $87 million of the increase in NPLs and our loss experience on these loans remains very good.  I guess it\u2019s fair to say the continued weakness in credit quality as Harris mentioned is likely to result in provisions and losses remaining somewhat at these historically high levels.", "The provision this quarter was up slightly from the prior quarter and the charge offs were down from the prior quarter.  That\u2019s an encouraging sign the fact that charge offs were down but clearly the NPL increase is somewhat troubling and I would note in terms of looking at reserve adequacy at a couple of things.", "First of all reserve coverage of total loans increased quite sharply from 1.65% to 2.03% but coverage of non-performing loans excluding FDIC assets slipped somewhat to about 58%.  It\u2019s important to remember that given the nature of our loan portfolio as we\u2019ve tried to point out in Investor presentations a lot of loans go non-accrual that never go to total loss unlike a lot of portfolios that are heavily consumer driven.", "Our non-accrual loans, the vast bulk of those in terms of dollars are analyzed under FAS 114 and are basically then carried at an estimated fair value without an associated reserve.  For those loans which are the bulk of the non-accrual loans that are collateralized by real estate that FAS 114 analysis is done based on collateral value.  Essentially what that means is that a recent appraisal or a new appraisal is obtained to value the property.", "If it\u2019s less than the loan balance the loan is charged down based on that new appraisal and an additional haircut ranging from 12% to 20% is taken to allow for the time and expenses of disposition and any further declines in value.  There are a lot of the most problematic loans that have already been haircut outside of the ALLL if you will and the same process is done with OREO.", "Again it is valued based on a recent appraisal with a haircut to that appraisal to allow for further disposition expenses.  Important to keep that in mind when you look at overall reserve adequacy when you\u2019re talking $1.5 billion numbers and haircuts of 12% to 20% plus charge downs that have already been taken.  Finally I would note that accruing loans past due 90 days or more at $88 million declined about a third from the prior quarter.", "At 21 basis points of net loans and losses it\u2019s back to a level where it was a year ago.  I\u2019d also point out that it\u2019s about 80% lower than the comparable number for the average of the top 50 banks, at least where they were at the end of year end.  We don\u2019t know what the numbers were at the end of this quarter.  Again that reflects the portfolio composition difference.", "Let me just see if there are any other comments on credit quality trend.  I don\u2019t think so.  We\u2019ll save them for your questions.  We just have seen continued weakness in credit across many credit types and most geographies now reflecting the continued economic weakness and therefore would expect that loan losses will remain below industry average our provision will probably continue to substantially exceed losses for the next few quarters until it\u2019s more clear exactly how this is recession is going to unfold.", "Loan balances by loan type, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a whole lot to talk about frankly on this page.  Net loans were down.  Most categories were down except for term CRE which was up but decline in the CRE construction largely offset that and some of that just reflects a completion of construction and roll into a mini-perm loan after it\u2019s contemplated in the original underwriting.", "Again you can see we\u2019ve broken out separately the FDIC supported assets.  A big chunk of those are CRE type assets but they do have this loss coverage from the FDIC.  Net interest margin did decline significantly this quarter.  The net spread between loan rates and deposit costs actually remained quite stable during the quarter.", "This decline primarily reflects two things, five basis points of it was due to the increase in nonperforming assets but the bigger chunk of it was the significant increase in average balances in money market instruments during the quarter after again we built liquidity and as you can see on line one the substantial decline in the earnings rate on those instruments down from 1.27% to 0.46%. ", "This reflected a conscious decision on the part of the company to build liquidity and if the outlook remains stable in terms of funding and other uncertainties we can take actions to drain some of this liquidity out of the company in the next quarter or two.  Not saying that we will, we\u2019re going to wait and see who things unfold but it is somewhat reversible by design.", "Finally Page 22, Capital Ratios, we show you some of the key ratios here.  I would note the tangible common equity ratio did decline from 5.89% to 5.26%.  The various actions related to Lockhart including the fair value mark and the increased assets accounted for 21 basis points of that decline and that\u2019s a one time event.  It doesn\u2019t happen again.  The FDIC assisted acquisition of Alliance Bank accounted for about 10 basis points.", "We think that given the likelihood that we don\u2019t have Lockhart type impacts and auction rate securities type impacts going forward that his is the largest basis point decline by some margin that we\u2019re likely to see.  I would also point out that this is very much in line with the kind of stress testing numbers that we put on the board in various Investor conferences during the first quarter.", "Regulatory capital ratios also declined in the quarter but remained well above the levels of a year ago.  The fact that the risk based capital measures declined a bit more than TCE primarily reflects the rating agency downgrade of CDO securities which shifted them to a much higher risk rating category.  Risk rated assets actually increased by nearly $5 billion during the quarter while the balance sheet didn\u2019t grow at all.", "It was a reflection of downgrades of securities to in some cases the junk status which takes them in some cases to a dollar for dollar capital against risk weight status.  Again given that a lot of these securities have already been downgraded that far the likelihood of this kind of incremental impact going forward strikes us not all that high.", "As I mentioned Lockhart Funding should be all wrapped up by the end of the second quarter.  The wrap up should have relatively little low single digit basis point impact on capital.  We\u2019ve talked about Alliance Bank but just to recap it operated five branches in Southern California.  We acquired at face value $923 million of loans and about $1 billion of deposits but about I don\u2019t know about 40% of those or so were non-core and have been running off as we re-price them.", "The core deposits have in fact been quite stable and we\u2019ve seen at least one or two customers bring significant balances back to the bank that they had taken out earlier.  The loans have been marked to substantially less than the $923 million as noted.", "Purchase accounting resulted in $17 million of goodwill and $5.5 million of CDI and we expect that cost cutting including consolidating two of the acquired branches will substantially improve the performance and that it will contribute about $20 million to pre-tax income this year.  Some of you saw the news that we also were the winning bidder on a smaller bank in Nevada, five branches along the Interstate 80 corridor in Northern Nevada.", "It\u2019s only about $250 million of deposits and $130 million of loans.  Again we acquired the whole bank and a very rich deposit base of about 30% DDA but with loss sharing from the FDIC and we expect this one to be accretive to earnings almost immediately.  It won\u2019t be a lot because it\u2019s not very big but it\u2019s a very nice little transaction.", "In summary loan growth we continue to actively try to originate loans but in the current economic environ pay downs and other reductions and charge offs are likely to continue to offset originations.  We do expect residential construction and land development balances to continue to decline as they\u2019ve done during recent quarters and net loan growth of other types will be fairly tepid at best.", "Deposit growth, was very encouraging during the first quarter particularly the DDA balances.  Some of that is seasonal.  We typically see a run up in DDA balances just prior to tax payment time.  The checks are all out there in the mail and we don\u2019t yet have a good read on where those balances will settle out after April 15th.", "Tax payments are made but the DDA balances held up quite nicely through the first half of April.  As I mentioned we may start to manage down broker deposits and some of the other discretionary funding that we use to build up excess liquidity if conditions remain reasonably stable and we also expect that we may have the opportunity to bid on additional sale of small banks in our footprint and augment deposits and loans that way.", "As noted earlier the liquidity significantly impacted the margin.  We do have the ability to manage the liability side of that equation to improve it somewhat over time and loan deposit spreads have been fairly stable.  I guess the best expectation since we really haven\u2019t started draining much of that excess liquidity out at this point is margin relatively stable in the second quarter and then we\u2019ll see in quarters after that.", "I\u2019ve mentioned Lockhart, it won\u2019t be an issue going forward.  Other securities, we\u2019ve adopted the new accounting standards on OTTI.  It does reduce the impact of OTTI on earnings but does not reduce the impact on tangible common but finally does have a favorable impact on key regulatory capital ratios.", "If bank stock prices kind of trade within a range we might anticipate somewhat continued more modest levels of OTTI in the next couple of quarters rather than $200 million or so like fourth quarter.  We think again the combination of all these things, this is probably the noisiest quarter we\u2019re going to report to you.  We certainly hope so.", "There are a lot of things in here that are highly unlikely to recur again or cannot recur again because the underlying condition is completely behind us.  I think corollary to that is the kind of erosion of the capital ratios that you saw here or at that kind of rate is not likely to persist.  There may be some continued erosion with slight OTTI and high levels of provision but probably not as severe as this quarter.", "In summary while conditions continue to be challenging for us in the industry we\u2019re encouraged by a number of things and I think the main focus now going forward will increasingly shift to that which is driven in part by the underlying economy and that is credit and more away from some of the other noisy things that we\u2019ve talked about on this call and some of the prior ones.", "With that I think we\u2019ll turn it over to you guys for questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "My first question is on the other real estate expense line, is that only related to further marks on your OREO properties?  Because I would have thought that would also include workout expenses on troubled loans which would have remained high given the increase in MPAs.", "Doyle Henry Simmons", "No, it reflects both.  The bounce up in the fourth quarter was not driven by expenses, it was driven by some significant write downs of OREO as we had some bids come in on some bulk properties.  We\u2019ve actually by not taking the bulk bids done a little bit better in disposing of them one by one.", "The volatility I\u2019d say is due to the changes in value but the underlying of maybe $5 million or $6 million probably just reflects expenses.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I did hear your explanation on how the real estate back loans translate into charge offs when they go NPL.  So maybe a different way of asking it or looking at it is how much of your charge offs or provisions this quarter related to new NPL formation versus adjustments or other factors such as existing NPL or changes in values?", "Doyle Henry Simmons", "It\u2019s a hard question to answer as you have phrased it.  The NPLs don\u2019t directly drive reserves.  The reserves are driven primarily by our internal classification of loans and since there was no loan growth this quarter, you can deduce that the entire provision was due to downgrades of loans.  The NPLs don\u2019t have a reserve associated with them for the most part.  They are charged down to fair value when we do the FAS 114 analysis.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "I could give you just maybe directionally.  During the quarter we had about $545 million of loans in excess of $1 million in size that came into non-accrual.  We had about $173 million of such loans that are greater than $1 million in size that came off.  Of that $173 million about $67 million of that was actually the result of charge offs.  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A little.  It is a tough question to answer but just given the size of the NPA increase in the quarter maybe I wasn\u2019t expecting charge offs necessarily to fall as much as they did.  The final question I had, at year end you guys had a net deferred tax asset of about $480 million.  Give you had a net loss last year and I\u2019m going to guess you may have another net loss this year, can you just remind us of what it will take for you to reevaluate that DTA and whether or not you might need to impair that.", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "We have evaluated it very carefully and have determined we don\u2019t need a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.  That\u2019s based on income taxes we paid and not the book provision and so yes, we paid substantial taxes in the last two years for the carry backs.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J. P. Morgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "Doyle, how far will you let the tangible common equity ratio fall to before you either raise common, you shrink the balance sheet or convert the TARP?  How should we be thinking about a lower end of that?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "We don\u2019t have a target for it Steve.  Frankly, it\u2019s going to be a feeling as you go along and also discussed stress testing with the regulators.  I think the interesting thing to me it has deteriorated almost exactly in line with some of the key stress elements that we have laid out there in particular in that scenario that I call the stylized stress test I think and a couple of investor presentations and so has the build up in the loan loss provision.  ", "So, in that stress test under some pretty adverse circumstances were something higher than this level of loss but something a bit lower than this level of provision persists for two years, that number stays I believe above 4% and while that\u2019s getting I agree pretty low by historical standards, to get us through this severe period, I think it means that we can make it through.  ", "I do think that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to watch very carefully over time and I would just note that every $50 million of common would result in about a 10 basis point increase in that number so it doesn\u2019t take a lot of issuance if we decide that we have to do it to meaningfully move the needle.  There are no current plants immediately contemplated.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "With the provision expense now at a level that exceeds the pre-tax pre-provision line, when you do look at your stress test what\u2019s your best guess as to when you\u2019re profitable again?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "I think you can probably foresee, we certainly hope so anyway, an end to the OTTI charges before year-end unless the economy takes a deep downturn from here.  As we\u2019ve noted our valuation there already incorporates an expectation that about a quarter of the banks that we\u2019re exposed to will fail and as I said we\u2019re clipping along at probably somewhat less than that rate currently.  ", "The key is the credit provision, I think it\u2019s likely to remain pretty high for another couple of quarters.  I can\u2019t see out the fourth quarter and beyond.  I would guess fourth quarter is probably the earliest I could see any return to profitability.  But, that\u2019s probably just a guess at the moment.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I guess maybe to ask Ken\u2019s question a different way, could you give us any color on the pace of inflows in to the classified asset category?  And, if possible, whereabouts do they stand at quarter end?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "I don\u2019t think internal classifications, I don\u2019t think is something we disclose because it\u2019s not comparable to what other banks have done but I would say if you look at the NPLs you\u2019re not being mislead by the direction of credit quality indicators generally.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Would you say the pace accelerated this quarter then?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "Yes it did.  I think clearly fourth quarter and first quarter reflect what started happening in the economy about October of last year.  We had I think in both fourth and first quarter we had some significant additional downgrades in Nevada, in Arizona.  We also had a fair number of downgrades but to less severe categories in Texas and in Utah.  So, it\u2019s fairly wide spread but also the loss content in a lot of it we still believe is fairly low.", "Harris Henry Simmons ", "About half of the total increase in non-accruals came out of Arizona and Nevada with two thirds of that amount in Nevada.  I think as we\u2019ve indicated previously, we felt that Arizona has started to plateau.  We\u2019ve seen that in their charge offs in the first quarter as well as the rate of inflow in to non-performing.  Nevada on the other hand, continues to show a greater stress than we\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter and we think that goes on here for a couple of quarters.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I guess just one follow up, can you give us any color on the type of credit problems or downgrades that you were seeing in the Texas market?", "Gerald J. Dent ", "It was primarily in the residential side of commercial real estate with some increase also in the energy sector.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from James Abbott \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "James Abbott \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "A couple of quick questions on asset deflation, as you re-run appraisals on a lot of properties, two, three, four times by now I\u2019m sure, are you seeing some stabilization in the asset deflation rates at this point?  You just mentioned Arizona is looking at some level of stability, maybe you can give us a little bit more color on that?", "I think Doyle you also mentioned what the categories of the increases in non-performing assets were and I was wondering if you touched on your commercial business loans just the C&I, not the owner occupied portion but the true C&I loans?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "I\u2019m going to let Jerry, Chief Credit Officer try to respond.", "Gerald J. Dent ", "With respect to the deflation rates in loan to value, we continue to see decreases in the values that we\u2019re receiving on appraisals.  It depends, state-by-state it varies, we have seen some hint of hitting the bottom so to speak in Arizona, we\u2019re starting to see more residential houses being sold but it still is going down pretty much in every state.  At a higher rate in Nevada, less so in Arizona and then not as much in any other states but it is still downward. The second part of your question, if you\u2019d mind repeating that.", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "Your question was on accruals?", "James Abbott \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yes, basically it\u2019s looking for non-performing assets by loan type and I think there was some comment mentioned on what the owner occupied increase was and also the construction, I think it was a $160 million increase in construction non-accruals, $87 million increase in owner occupied commercial real estate and I don\u2019t know if you mentioned the C&I category directly?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "There was $260 million of total construction and land development NPL increase of which $160 was in Nevada and Arizona.  So, you had $260 plus $87 of the owner occupied, that accounted for well over half of the total NPL increase.  I don\u2019t know if we have the CNI piece.  Do you have that Jerry or a rough estimate of it?", "Gerald J. Dent ", "CNI increase?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "Yes, other than the owner occupied and the NPLs.", "Gerald J. Dent ", "It was about $45 million.", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "$45 million, so then most of the rest will be in non-residential CRE which I mentioned was also up.", "James Abbott \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "This will be my final question but, one as we drill in to the construction increase, the $260 million, is that primarily residential construction and I assume it is.  If you could give us some color on commercial construction because historically or at least over the last four quarters or so commercial construction has been holding in there okay.  We are hearing that commercial construction is breaking down, so any comments on that?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "We did see an increase in the commercial construction, this time in fact it exceeded the residential amount during the first quarter.  It\u2019s primarily in the retail type properties.", "James Abbott \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "How much \u2013 actually, you\u2019ve probably got that on your where is Waldo sheet but, how much is your commercial construction portfolio?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "You mean non-residential commercial?", "James Abbott \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "So excluding multifamily?", "[H. Walter Young ]", "Commercial construction is $4.2 million.", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "But, that includes multifamily.  Total commercial construction, that was at year end Walter?", "[H. Walter Young ]", "March.", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "March was $4.2 million.  $700 was multifamily so about $3.5 [billion] total.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Hess \u2013 JMC Securities.", "John Hess \u2013 JMC Securities", "I had two questions, one is can you maybe provide some information on early stage delinquency trends if possible?", "Harris Henry Simmons ", "They are up.  We can do that by a number of different categories.", "John Hess \u2013 JMC Securities", "I guess the primary consideration would be early stage delinquencies are you seeing them move up at a more rapid rate than you saw in Q4?  Then the second part of that would be by category are you seeing shifts in where you\u2019re seeing early stage delinquency problems?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "I can tell you the 30 to 59 day delinquency on the entire portfolio was 1.59% at the end of the first quarter.  I don\u2019t know Jerry if you\u2019ve got the comparables handy here.  I don\u2019t have it right at our finger tips for the prior quarter, we could get that.  I think you\u2019ll find it in our call reports or our [inaudible] as well.  I think in general you\u2019re seeing delinquencies go up in just about every category.  In many of them they still remain relatively low by industry standards.", "Our [inaudible] portfolio is a little over 50 basis points total delinquency, that\u2019s 30 days and beyond not just 30 to 59.  The credit card portfolio is I think about 2.6%, 30 and beyond.  The single family is up above, is about 5.5% as I recall and that\u2019s being driven primarily by Jumbo one-time closed loans, a lot of it in Utah but some in other states.  C&I is up to about 3.3% and has been climbing steadily but not at a sharply accelerating rate.  ", "Then, we have seen some uptick discussed in both CRE term and CRE non-residential construction.  I don\u2019t happen to have those numbers on the top of my head.  Does that help?", "John Hess \u2013 JMC Securities", "Yes, it just sounds like maybe a year ago we were talking about seeing the rate of increase mostly associated with development or construction loans and it sounds like it\u2019s a little bit more broad in its scope at this point?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "Yes, the economic downturn that really accelerated early last fall is clearly manifesting itself.", "John Hess \u2013 JMC Securities", "The last question would be it sounds like strategically you\u2019re directing yourselves towards maybe some more FDIC assisted opportunities in your markets.  I\u2019m wondering can you characterize for us the marketplace there?  Do you see a big pipeline of opportunities?  Can you characterize it, is it a bidding market?  Are there more, or less other players out there than you\u2019d expect at this point in the cycle that would be bidding against you for these assets?", "Harris Henry Simmons ", "No, I think it depends really on the location.  One, we acquired [inaudible] up in Northern Nevada, it\u2019s actually the kind of market I love because it\u2019s rural, they\u2019ve got a great deposit base, not overrun by competitors and people trying to get in there but it also means that you don\u2019t have a lot of bidders for what is there.  That situation is going to be different if you\u2019ve got something in Las Angeles County.  So, I think it\u2019s really going to be site specific.", "We look at these deals one-by-one as they come along in terms of it there\u2019s a fit we\u2019ve been bidding we think very conservatively.  We did this past weekend, the economics of it are exceptionally compelling for us and we think it\u2019s a win-win.  We think we\u2019ll probably save the FDIC money from what it would accomplish in liquidating the bank but it is also not expected to have any meaningful negative impact on our capital or losses.  It\u2019s really accretive right out of the shoot.  So, it\u2019s the kind of small deal you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re more likely to try and do.", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "Capital though is clearly constrained on doing a lot of these things simply because they do add to the balance sheet size even though the deals themselves are very, very attractive and the risk is very low.  Once again, in the case of this bank in Nevada, we big a negative first loss position which means that the FDIC will actually write us a check to close prior to the loss share even kicking in.", "So, we\u2019d love to do more of them, there is a pipeline of these things throughout the West.  The ones that don\u2019t have a reasonable deposit franchise, we don\u2019t look at very seriously.  If they\u2019ve got a strong deposit franchise and you can get the kind of loss sharing conservatively bid, we\u2019ll try to look at it as long as capital ratios don\u2019t suffer too much for it.", "We have about a half dozen calls left in the queue.  We\u2019re coming up on one hour and we\u2019re very conscious of the time back on the east coast for those of you who have had a busy week or will have one.  I\u2019d like to suggest now if you could we\u2019ll try and take a call from everybody in the queue but try and limit yourself to one question just to keep this time manageable.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup. ", "Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup", "I have a follow up question, I know this has been asked a lot of different ways on the call but, kind of going back to some of the presentations that you guys have put up where you have looked at the loan-to-value in the commercial real estate portfolio and on average it\u2019s been, depending on what class, in the 55% to 65% range.  So, obviously as these loans go in to non-performing status you\u2019ve got a good deal of equity to deal with that mitigates some of the loss exposure but, I was wondering if you can provide any color beyond that?", "Whether the deals that are going to non-performing loan status and you\u2019re writing them down, are these deals kind of exceptions to that loan-to-value average that you\u2019ve put out there or has the value of the collateral deteriorated well through the 35% which is the buffer you may have had?  I\u2019m just trying to get a feel to what kind of loss exposure you\u2019re having on what\u2019s passing in the NPLs.", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "I\u2019ll make a general comment and then turn it to Jerry if he has a specific comment. You\u2019ve got to remember that those 50% and 60% kind of numbers are averages across the whole portfolio, most of which to this day remains performing.  It\u2019s unlikely that someone who has the means is going to walk away from a credit that he still has a lot of equity in.  So, I think it\u2019s a fair general statement to say that the problems occur primarily in those credits where the values have declined the most sharply.  You\u2019ve got less loan-to-value coverage and that\u2019s where even if a borrower has the ability to carry, may choose not to if he doesn\u2019t have to.  So, the losses come out of the LTV pieces as a general matter.  Jerry?", "Gerald J. Dent ", "I think that pretty well covers it.", "Harris Henry Simmons ", "I think it\u2019s been residential land development where the values of these kinds of things, trying to sell a note in Arizona, Nevada today, you\u2019re probably seeing 85% deterioration or thereabouts.  So, even if you had 50%, 60% going in, that\u2019s proved not to be enough and that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing some loss.", "Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup", "That\u2019s where the bulk of the losses are coming from?  It\u2019s not as much, or if I can ask the question, it\u2019s not as much of the properties that are already sitting in NPLs, it\u2019s more on the inflows that are coming in?", "Harris Henry Simmons ", "Yes.  The good news is that we at least we\u2019re in first position in most all of this.  We don\u2019t have a lot of second mortgage exposure, stuff where it\u2019s totaling disappearing.  But, in land development, a lot of the value has disappeared way beyond what we had initially  margined in.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Do you expect banks of your size to have to be required to undergo a stress test?   And, if so, have you been given any indication from regulators as to what timings for that might look like?", "Harris Henry Simmons ", "That\u2019s a good question, I wish I had a definitive answer to it.  I think it\u2019s fair to say the regulators have been extremely busy with the 19 elite $100 billion club which process purportedly is coming to an end here shortly.  I guess it\u2019s fair that my expectation is that we will have stress test and capital discussions with our regulators, exactly what the nature of those discussions will be in comparison to those for the larger banks I really don\u2019t know.  I expect to start those discussion later this month.  I tried to have them earlier but frankly they\u2019re just not ready for us.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Jennifer Demba \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Harris or Doyle, can you give us some qualitative commentary on California?  I think previously you guys have indicated that things have kind of bottomed there.  For your portfolio can you kind of tell us what you\u2019re seeing?", "Harris Henry Simmons ", "I\u2019d say that I think we still generally feel that way.  I think we\u2019ve seen generally a bottoming in the residential construction portfolio.  We\u2019re seeing a broadening of problems and I\u2019ll get to the unemployment picture in California is as ugly as it is anyplace.  So, we\u2019re seeing a broadening in terms of the categories of loans that are seeing some stress.", "With that said, if I look at for example, the change in non-performing assets this quarter, I mean California was about 11% of the total, the total increase.  So, we\u2019re not seeing the same kinds of problems that we\u2019re seeing particularly in Nevada or Arizona.  So, I think that\u2019s probably still a true statement.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Doyle, did you guys talk about the par balance of the securities you took the impairment on, the $132 million of OTTI that you took?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "The par value of those securities and where they came from?", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Right.", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "No, we didn\u2019t.  Can we?", "Gerald J. Dent ", "Not off the top of my head.  I mean, all of them are within the non-investment grade which you to have broken out.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "I mean I guess what kind of haircut was that $132 million?  If you don\u2019t have it we can catch up later.", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "I think we might have to get back to you on that one.  I don\u2019t think we brought that this time.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kenneth Usdin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "A quick question on the trust preferred book, can you just give us \u2013 Doyle, you mentioned that that loss expectation range earlier and I\u2019m just wondering if that same range still holds or if it has changed at all what would be the drivers of better or worse expectations outside of stock price movement meaning does it have the [inaudible] ratings changed at all and just what\u2019s your general outlook?", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "Do you want to take a crack at that?", "W. David  Hemingway", "I\u2019d thought you\u2019d say that the really the stress change hasn\u2019t changed.  I mean the biggest drivers \u2013 well, there\u2019s two big drivers, one actual defaults where the FDIC actually closes more banks.  Obviously, that\u2019s a permanent change which we haven\u2019t seen and stock prices going down, some of which we saw in the first quarter caused the probabilities to go up or to increase which causes the prices to go down which is what you\u2019ll see here in these numbers.  But, other than what\u2019s been talked about I haven\u2019t seen anything else that would change either the model or the stress test.  ", "Doyle L. Arnold ", "There\u2019s probably some further deterioration of lease ratings head but the part that appears at least at this time that there\u2019s somewhat of an offset to that and a bounce back of bank stock prices that\u2019s occurred late in the quarter and so far this quarter ex today\u2019s performance.  Again, remember that it\u2019s primarily regional and smaller banks like the ABAQ prices not the BIX type prices that are important here.  So, I think we\u2019re still within the range of those stress tests but frankly, we haven\u2019t re-run them since we did all the quarter end reevaluation.", "Which, with the downgrades, a good place on the 30th of March, the 27th through the 30th of March quite frankly it was hard enough to just get that all factored in and close the books rather than redo the stress testing.  So, we\u2019re going to take I think one more question at this point and then we\u2019ll wrap it up for the evening.  Of course, Clark is available to answer questions as well.", "Harris Henry Simmons ", "", "Again, we thank you all for your attention.  As I mentioned, I think this is the nosiest quarter we\u2019re going to throw at you.  Some of the things in this quarter just can\u2019t recur again because the underlying facts are no longer there.  I think it\u2019s probably also one of the most disappointing because so many things all got collapsed into this quarter but again, I want you to bear in mind just about everything that happened this quarter are things that we talked about and are within the broad range of things that we have talked about in investor presentations in the past.", "We\u2019ve got probably at least a couple more quarters of significant loan loss provisions, maybe a couple more quarters of hopefully not more significant OTTI before we start to see the upturn out of this.  So, thank you for your attention, your interest and we will look forward to chatting with some of you at investor conferences in the coming few weeks and all of you again one quarter from now.", "Operator", "", "Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

(Operator Instructions)", "I would like to turn the call over to Mr. James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations.", "James Abbott", "Thanks Jerry and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our second quarter 2009 earnings. I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. ", "We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. If you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available as it is available as an Adobe Acrobat file www.zionsbankcorporation.com and can be easily down loaded and printed. We will limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q-and-A we ask you limit your questions to one primary and one follow up questions to enable other participants to ask questions.", "I will now turn the call the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris.", "Harris Simmons", "Thank you very much, James. Let me start by welcoming James as our new Director of Investor Relations. We are really pleased to have him here with us and he\u2019s already making a great contribution to our company. We welcome all of you to the call and appreciate your interest in the company and what is obviously continuing to be a very challenging credit environment.", "The second quarter might be best summed up as a mixed quarter with several notable positive developments offset by continued pressure on credit. We are very encouraged by a 5% increase in our core pre-tax, pre-provision earnings compared to the first quarter. This keeps that very strong core measure of earnings at just over $1 billion annually and it reflects solid margin performance and what we think has been good cost control in recent months as well as the successful execution of several capital transactions which have bolstered our capital ratios.", "We\u2019ve had, during the quarter strong average non-interest bearing deposit growth. That was a significant factor in the improvement in net interest income, which increased 4% over the prior quarter. These deposits increased nearly $800 million or 8% sequentially. This growth allowed us to reduce some of our higher cost CDs and broker deposits and in turn to shed low yielding assets.", "Most notably, we trimmed excess cash balances by more than $1 billion. These assets had a meager yield of only about 30 basis points and have been carried as a negative spread. During the prior two quarters we\u2019d increased our liquidity levels due to the crisis conditions in the market at the time and as economic conditions continue to show signs of stabilization, we plan to continue to take steps to further reduce some of these cash balances and excess liquidity.", "During the quarter, we engaged in several capital market actives designed a significantly enhance our capital levels. In aggregate we increased our tangible common equity by $511 million an 18% increase from the first quarter level, we were able to accomplish this while minimizing delusion to exiting shareholders as common shares outstanding increased just over 8%.", "These actions achieved almost exactly what we estimated when we announced them on June 1, and in some cases was slightly ahead of plan. On a gross basis, such actions added 99 basis points to our tangible common equity to asset ratio. Net, our tangible common equity to asset climbed to 5.66% from 5.26% in the first quarter. Our tier-1 common to risk weighted asset ratio, a new ratio that many of you are tracking rose to approximately 6.07% from 5.73%. ", "The largest single offset to the positive developments in the quarter is further deterioration in credit, or in part reflected I guess by a significant increase in allowance for credit losses. This was caused by a re-estimation of some of loss migration factors particularly, with regard to CRE loans and the incorporation of the possibility of a more protracted credit cycle, which led to a provision of more than $760 million in the quarter.", "Net charge-offs increased to $347 million, within that net charge-off number, I think it\u2019s important to note there is one single loan charge-off amounting to just over $47 million, might be viewed as unusual. We talked about the credit before, the company is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy process is taking longer than we originally expected. Therefore, we elected to change the loans off in it\u2019s entirely.", "However, subsequent to quarter end additional developments suggest that we may expect full repayment most likely in mid 2010. So we\u2019d expected substantial recovery all along, but felt that the asset was not bankable as an asset on our books. Now we expect to see full resolution in mid 2010.", "Excluding that loan, our net charge-offs were about 2.9% of average loans, up from 1.5% in the prior quarter. The elevated net charge-offs are attributable to continued deterioration in collateral values, primarily in the construction category. Finally, we are very pleased to report on the acquisition of Vineyard Bank on Friday. This is the fourth FDIC assisted transaction we\u2019ve completed within the last year. ", "Vineyard helps fill out our Southern California franchise and we were able to assume the bank with very limited capital strain and credit risk due to loss sharing from the FDIC. The economics on this, as we\u2019ll explain in a few minutes are extremely compelling for us. ", "With that overview, I\u2019ll now ask Doyle Arnold, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, to review the quarterly performance.", "", "Doyle Arnold", "Thank, Harris. Good evening everyone. Let me also welcome James to his first quarter on this side of the phone after spending a number of years on your side of the phone. We\u2019ve got a lot to go through, again I\u2019ll try to cover a lot, and I will try to leave some time for questions at the end. ", "As noted in the press release the highlights are, we had a net loss attributable to common $40.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share for the quarter. As Harris mentioned, our core pretax, pre-provision earnings actually climbed to an annualized $1.05 billion.", "We\u2019ve talked about it being in the range of a billion dollars before, that\u2019s up about $45 million from the prior quarter and it excludes several items that we think are unusual or lumpy, otherwise one time in nature, but represents our capacity to earn our way through this economic cycle.", "Capital actions added in addition to the capital impact that Harris mentioned added $340 million after tax or $2.93 per share to the bottom line and so as Harris said, total capital raised was $511 million, but $171 million of that went directly to the capital part of the balance sheet, it did not flow through the P&L.", "The major offsetting factor was the much larger than normal provision of more than $760 million, of which about $415 million went into building the allowance for loan losses. The reserve build amounted to approximately $2.20 a share. Impairment and valuation losses on securities were $53.7 million, down from $283 million in the prior quarter; and OTTI on the bank and insurance CDOs which I know a lot of you are focused on was $18.3 million of that, also down very substantially from previous quarters. ", "Finally, Lockhart was fully consolidated by the end of the second quarter, no additional balance sheet impact or evaluation losses to come from Lockhart. Now to go into some of the more salient details, if you will follow me please to Page 14 of the schedules. I will note first that total assets declined $1.6 billion compared to the second quarter and of that, about $900 million was a reduction in interest bearing deposits and commercial paper line of the money market investments. ", "We indicated last quarters call that we had a couple of billion dollars of excess liquidity and we were going to endeavor to shrink that, because in effect those investments carried a negative spread. We have made significant progress toward that objective, but we don\u2019t believe we are finished yet at this point.", "You\u2019ll also note just a few lines down the page under investment securities that we moved a significant amount about $557 million of securities from the held-to-maturity category to the available-for-sale category. These were predominantly bank and insurance CDOs that had been downgraded to below investment grade. We believe these have the most potential for any future OTTI. We have no current plans to sale these securities, but this reclassification does give us greater flexibility and dealing with them in the future.", "In the deposit section a lot of interesting things to point out. First, as Harris mentioned noninterest-bearing DDA was $11.1 billion at the end of the quarter, up $624 million from the prior quarter and it\u2019s more than $1.4 billion greater than a year ago. ", "I won\u2019t go to the average balance sheet, but average noninterest-bearings deposits increased about $800 million during the quarter. Some of the increase in DDA was a move out of foreign deposits, namely sweep accounts. You can see that foreign declined $240 million and essentially all of that we believe ended up in back on shore in noninterest-bearing, non-personal or business DDA accounts.", "You can also see some of the other actions to reduce more expensive funding. Jumbo time deposits were down a couple hundred million. Money market accounts were down, a lot of that were brokered money market accounts. Federal home loan bank advances were down. We repaid both some term borrowing, as well as paid down some short term borrowings. You add all of that together you get to a reduction in both deposits and borrowings that were offset by the decline in the balance sheet assets.", "As we\u2019ve mentioned, it\u2019s essentially our funding that\u2019s driving the size of the balance sheet at this point. So, as we can shrink expensive sources of funding, we can bring the assets side down and run off more low spread earning assets.", "If we turn now to page 15, I\u2019ll note first of all that part of one of the contributors to the core earnings engine, Harris mentioned in his opening remarks was that net interest income was up nearly $19 million before provision for loan losses. ", "During the quarter, despite the balance sheet shrinkage that I just mentioned or maybe because of the balance sheet shrinkage in part that we paid down deposits or reduced deposits that were costing us more than the assets that they were earning. There were other contributing factors, which we will come to when I talk about the margin.", "I will note under noninterest income that the first four lines, which are short of core. NII were relatively stable, nothing particularly unusual to talk about there. As you heard from some others a little up tick in our capital market and foreign exchange activity just not as big of a business as therefore a smaller impact than some others have reported.", "Fair value and nonhedge derivative income of $20 million was again positive about $13 million of those gains were due to hedge and effectiveness in the recognition of gains on those instruments. You strip that out and you still have nonhedge derivative income back in a positive territory as opposed to being a drag on earnings as it was for a number of quarters, up through the fourth quarter of last year. ", "The impairment losses on investment securities, has a net of $42 million down from $83 million in the prior quarter and $196 million in the quarter before that. This was split between credit impairment of $42 million that went through the income statement and the remainder of $29.5 million went to other comprehensive income. We\u2019ll also talk a bit more about the securities portfolio in a bit. ", "Valuation losses on securities purchased was $11.7 million; that\u2019s just below the impairment line and it\u2019s a combination of the last write-downs on the securities and consolidating Lockhart, as well as the small additional write-down on some auction rate securities that were purchased in the prior quarter. We don\u2019t expect much in the way of activity on that line going forward. ", "Below that is the $466 million gain on the swap termination and the debt modification that has been detailed on page three in the press release and about which we talked a lot in the June 1 call, as well as in our report around June 30 of the wrap up of the capital markets actions. ", "Acquisition related gains of $23 million. Those gains are attributable to the alliance and great basin acquisitions. Alliance was closed very late in the first quarter. We had initially, on a preliminary basis booked something over $10 million of goodwill. ", "Re-estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired led to the booking of a bargain purchase gain related to that acquisition, and then an additional gain related to the acquisition of great basin in Nevada in the second quarter. We expect to also recognize a larger bargain purchase gain under FASB 141 R in the third quarter related to Vineyard Bank which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute. ", "Non-interest expense; core non-interest expenses were essentially flat despite a $4 million run rate in the increase in the FDIC assessment and about a $4 million increase in workout expenses. Salary and employee benefits declined sequentially quarter-over-quarter about $2 million, despite the fact that we added over about 100 employees from the two FDIC assisted deals and had expense during the quarter. ", "The second quarter of 2009 included $4.3 million of severance costs, which was about $2.5 million more than the first quarter. So we\u2019re pretty pleased with the salary and employee benefits line coming down despite those unusual items. We have reduced FDE by about 3.2% since year end, even while adding staff from the two FDIC assisted transactions.", "FDIC premiums increased substantially and included a $24.2 million special one-time assessment. Our best estimate of the run rate per quarter, absent those assessments now is around $18 million, for those of you trying to model that expense going forward, and that does not include any other rumored special assessments that might happen fourth quarter later or in the future years. ", "There are two other unusually large items included in other expense. One is debt extinguishment cost of $5.1 million, a lot of that related to early repayment of term that are home loan bank borrowings that I mentioned earlier, those came down. The remainder is, we had a provision for the unfunded lending commitments of $7.9 million, which is rather larger than it had been in most prior quarters.", "Finally, just above the net earrings applicable to common, you will note in effect, a negative preferred stock dividend of $52.4 million, its label preferred stock redemption. That\u2019s where the common equity pick up of the tender offer for the series A preferred shares shows up. So we\u2019re in an unusual situation this quarter, where earnings are applicable to common or better than total net income.", "We\u2019ll talk a bit about the investment securities portfolio. Once again, we\u2019ve provided you with two versions of it, showing you on page 18, how they breakout using the highest credit rating on age security and on page 19, how they breakout using the lowest credit rating. There do remain significant differences between the various rating agencies on how we treat that.", "Just for clarification, the par value, on the first column we\u2019ve gotten questions about this. It shows the value that we would realize upon full payment of the security, in accordance with its terms. It\u2019s not the original face value, but in effect the remaining face value. ", "There were kind of two countervailing impacts on the valuations of these securities during the quarter, some positive and some negative. The positives were the bank stock prices, as I think you\u2019re aware generally improved significantly compared to March 31 values and the bank stock price volatility declined. In our level three modeling, both of these favorably impact the default probabilities, i.e., reduce it, and therefore favorably impact the expected impairment on the issues that we hold.", "Furthermore, the rate of defaults so far has been below the assumed default rate in our models up until now. Offsetting that is individual banks that are in our CEO pool also experienced deterioration. More of them began to defer interest payments on the trust preferred debts, which triggered additional impairment in our securities and acceleration in bank closures or deferrals to a level above our projected rate during the next several months could cause additional impairment charges; although, we don\u2019t think they\u2019re likely at this stage to jump meaningfully from the kind of level you saw in this quarter. ", "We\u2019ve also added one further degree of granularity to the schedule. We\u2019ve broken the non-investment grade securities in available for sale and in held-to-maturity down at two components. We have separated out specifically. You can see it in the third line of numbers. ", "I\u2019m on page 19, held-to-maturity you can see non-investment grade/OTTI-picked. You can see that line again under other and then down under available for sale you can see at under trust preferred securities bank and insurance with a $786 million handle etc.", "So we\u2019ve broken out separately those specific CDOs that either we have OTTI or have picked or take this payment in kind for those of you who may not be familiar with the acronym. We\u2019ve done this, because we think that it\u2019s most likely that future OTTI if it occurs is more likely to come out of those securities than the other securities. So we\u2019ve broken those out separately.", "The largest piece of this as I mentioned is in the available for sale, trust preferred bank and insurance of $78.6 million. Notably, the company\u2019s tangible common equity balances and ratios already reflect the $359 million reduction in this portfolio, i.e., to 46% of par. So, we\u2019ve already incorporated that much into our capital ratios and balance if they were deemed totally worthless on an after tax basis impact capital by another 212. Though if we were to impair the amount that\u2019s already NOCI, it would have an adverse impact on earnings, but wouldn\u2019t affect tangible capital.", "Turning now to page 20, credit quality. Provision for loan losses was up significantly for the prior quarter. Several things drove it to a higher level of internal criticized and classified loans, and the re-estimation of some of our loss migration factors based on more recent lost history. Then we\u2019ve also tried to incorporate the possibility of maybe not the likely hood of a somewhat more contracted credit cycle, so there was some reserve building driven by those factors. ", "Non-performing loans and OREO increased 17% to $1.9 billion if you exclude the FDIC supported assets. I will note that the FDIC supported assets reflects both, some reductions in the alliance assets that were worked out or charged off during the quarter, as well as the addition of the great basin assets. There will be a somewhat larger addition of FDIC supported assets in the third quarter due to the Vineyard Bank acquisition that we announced on Friday night. ", "So that line will mostly likely continue to increase, although we\u2019ve had success inline with or better than we had hoped thus far, in the rate of resolution of alliance bank problem assets. The shares noted earlier $347 million of net charge offs, did include the $47.5 million that was related to a single large C&I credit that we\u2019ve commented on previously, and on which substantial or complete recovery or still expected in 2020.", "In terms of where the losses came from, I\u2019ll just note that our Nevada and Arizona bank accounted for just about 50% of net charge-offs or 58% if you exclude that one large lump. In other words, they were right around $150 million between the two of them. ", "Real estate construction loans in term of the type of loan, also accounted more about 50% of total losses. The larger components again were in Arizona and Nevada. The real estate construction losses came about one-third from residential acquisition and construction and about two-thirds from commercial acquisition and construction. ", "The reserve balance increased approximately 50% and the ACL at the bottom of the page, the Allowance for Credit Losses, which included the unfunded commitments reserve increased to 3.23%. That would have put us, based on the first quarter data for peers in the top quartile among regional banks in terms of ACL.", "We do expect there will be some further increases in that reserve coverage ratio in the next couple of quarters, but the increase we don\u2019t think will be assured; it\u2019ll be much more modest than this quarter we believe. ", "A few comments on loan quality trends there is still deterioration overall, but there are some areas where credit trends maybe moderating a bit. Early stage delinquencies, that is 30 to 89 days past due actually fell 35% to $509 million, down from $781 million in the prior quarter. On a consolidated basis, these delinquencies are more closely comparable to the level at the end of year, 2008 and the Nevada and Arizona subsidiaries are back to where they were at approximately September of 2008. ", "Total delinquencies including 90 days past due were roughly flat for the quarter and that may be encouraging. Classified assets in Texas declined slightly in the second quarter, after sharp increases in each of the last two quarters. While there have been some increases in problem term CRE and C&I loans. Construction loans continue to make up the vast majority of the problem credits and charge-offs at this time.", "Turning to page 21, we\u2019ll talk about we\u2019re at loan growth or loan declines. C&I or total loans declined $566 million, about $41.5 billion. The significant percentage of that decline is attributable to charge-offs. The largest declines by category were in C&I down $335 million, and most of that was in the unsecured C&I or secured by other than real estate, which is included in the owner-occupied piece, that was about flat. The borrowers just basically continue to be conservative and try to de-lever. ", "Commercial real estate in total declined $181 million. Construction and land development was itself down $417 million, reflecting both charge-offs and pay downs, but in terms of CRE, as it has in recent quarters did grow as some commercial construction loans that converted into many prime loan upon completion of the construction project.", "Home equity lines saw very modest growth during the quarter, and the portfolio continues to perform very well on both a relative and absolute basis. Delinquencies at the end of June were a bit less than 60 basis points, which by industry standard is rather remarkable these days.", "Page 22, net interest margin, the NIM rose to 4.09% from 3.93%, despite the increase in non-performing assets, largely as a function of reducing high cost deposits and lowest yielding assets, primarily and secondarily reducing the liabilities and cost of interest bearing liabilities and the cost of deposits themselves. ", "You can see on the very top line, money market investments again down about $1 billion. You can note that the total yield on interest earnings assets was about flat. The total cost of interest bearing liabilities was down 20 basis points to 1.55%, and the cost of interest bearing deposits was down even more to 1.46% from 1.73%. So to put it all together, the net interest spread was up significantly as was the net interest margin. ", "We think that the incremental margin on new loan production was near 5% this quarter and loans had an initial yield of over 6% on new loans during the quarter. A little bit more than 25% of the total loan book was originated during the thinner spread years of 2004 to 2007 and continues to come up for renewal and renewed re-pricing, and that phenomenon will continue for several more years yet. ", "While it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly what that impact will be, it has been and we think it\u2019s reasonable to expect continued favorable impact on core NIM expansion. Just for those who are counting, the total NIM, adverse impact from non-accrual loans we think is now more than 30 basis points. A couple of other notes that aren\u2019t in the spread sheets, first of all I mentioned the Lockhart funding is fully consolidated at quarter end. There can be no further balance sheet or income statements impacts from repurchases of assets from Lockhart. ", "Then just to flush out an acquisition, as we noted in the earnings release, on Friday we were selected by the FDIC as the winning bidder on the failed Vineyard Bank in the Inland Empire area, Southern California. Our bid was on a whole bank basis with loss sharing, same kind of bid structure as the last two deals we\u2019ve done. It had no impact on second quarter results quarter results since it closed last Friday night. We bid a discount of $242 million to the stated value of Vineyard\u2019s assets. FDIC will bear 80% of the first $465 million of the loan and OREO losses and 95% of the losses above $465 million.", "We expect to recognize a pretax bargain purchase gain in excess of $100 million in the third quarter. The exact amount is we don\u2019t know yet, because we haven\u2019t done the detailed work to fair value all of the assets that we acquired. That will actually take a couple of months.", "So, we\u2019ll have an update for you on next quarter\u2019s call, but we think the $100 million number is probably a slightly conservative number, but we\u2019re not sure yet. We expect thereafter that the transaction will be $0.04 to $0.06 of share accretive on annualized basis. Obviously, larger than that in the third quarter, but will settle down to a run rate of $0.01 to $0.015 a share in quarters thereafter.", "Due to the bargain purchase gain, we estimate that the acquisition will be roughly neutral to tangible common equity capital ratios and roughly six to nine basis points accretive to Tier 1 capital ratios. The exact numbers will depend on the size of that gain, as well on the exact balance sheet when it\u2019s trued up that was passed from the FDIC receivership to us.", "Turning now to summary of guidance for next few quarters and then we\u2019ll open it up for some questions. We continue to try to be very active in our markets and seeking to extend new credits, but in the current economic environment, pay downs and charge-offs are likely to continue to offset or more than offset originations. We do expect continued decline in residential construction and development balances as probably as well as commercial and probably C&I as well.", "So, the best look for loan growth is, setting aside or netting out the impact of the Vineyard acquisition, which will add about $1.4 billion in loans. Net of that, we expect flat to declining loan balances again this quarter. We think deposit growth is likely to remain reasonably good, but we\u2019ll continue to try to manage down higher cost CDs and brokered deposits to reduce more of the excess liquidity.", "We do expect as I sort of mentioned that the core NIM will continue to expand as we shed this excess liquidity and the more expensive funding sources. However, there will be some noise in the NIM starting in the third quarter that I want to explain. I want to give you three different components for those of you building your models.", "First of all, prior quarters had swap gains on those terminated swaps that accreted into income and added about seven basis points to the margin, because of the capital actions that we took, most of those swap gains were recognized completely and immediately in second quarter earnings. We\u2019ll eliminate most of that earnings benefit from future quarters.", "So all else being equal, if nothing else happened, the margins would be down seven basis points third quarter compared to second. I\u2019ve already mentioned all else we\u2019d only think will be equal. Other things were driving it the other way, but I just wanted you to know that, that adjustment needs to be made in your thinking.", "Furthermore, by marking much of our sub debt-to-market and by adding the option to convert to preferred stock, we\u2019ve created a $382 million net pretax discount on that debt which must be accreted back to par through the P&L over the life of the associated debt, which will act as expense in the net interest income line.", "With an important caveat just a moment on that one, the quarterly run rate expense initially associated with this discount accretion will be approximately $16 million, but that run rate will decline if and as various investors exercise their option to convert to preferred stock overtime.", "Finally, upon that decision to exercise, to convert from sub debt to preferred stock, the discount accretion is immediately recognized on that debt that converts. So, there will be expecting that conversions maybe lumpy and unpredictable. There will be lots of noise in the NIM over the next several quarters and perhaps a couple of years.", "Although, we think it\u2019s going to be a challenge to model it, because timing of those conversions are unpredictable. Therefore, what we do expect to discuss with you in future quarters is the NIM in terms of core NIM, which excludes the above items.", "Basically, if you want to get a good starting running rate, the core NIM for 2,000, second quarter was 4%, backing out the preferred swap gain accretion and that was up from 3.83% in the first quarter. We do expect the provision for loan losses and actual losses to remain somewhat elevated in the third quarter, although we\u2019re not predicting a repeat of the second quarter levels. We think will be some reserve build in the third quarter as well, but not as large as the second quarter.", "I know you\u2019d like me to be more precise than that, but quite frankly we\u2019ve got countervailing indicators in the credit quality. It\u2019s just very, very difficult to predict how it\u2019s going to model out in the next couple of quarters. OTTI, the rate of defaults has been below our modeling, but the rate of banks deferring has been somewhat higher and has driven additional OTTI charges. We think we could therefore expect to see some continued modest levels of OTTI, perhaps the double digit numbers similar to this quarter.", "Bargain purchase gain from Vineyard, I\u2019ve already mentioned that. Expenses: we have additional measures underway to reduce core expenses, but we think these are likely to be at least somewhat offset by continued OREO and other workout expenses. For share count, recall that we issued about half of the announced $250 million of common equity that we were going to sell into the market and we expect to issue the rest during the next couple of quarters at current stock prices. I\u2019m not forecasting, I\u2019m just saying using kind of today\u2019s close, you would add a little less than 10 million shares if you issued it all at that price.", "Finally, acquisitions and mergers: I like to note that with the Vineyard acquisition and the two that came before it, we\u2019ve now acquired well in excess of $2 billion of assets in assisted transactions. While we think that the actual loss content is well understood and it will be very successful in working those out, nonetheless, it\u2019s a lot to workout.", "Therefore, I think it\u2019s fair to that think we\u2019re likely to take a breather from further such deals in the next quarter or two or perhaps three. We need to make sure that we don\u2019t get indigestion and get behind the curve on those things. So, we think they\u2019re great deals, but there is a limit for how much of that we can hope to manage our way through.", "In summary, to conclude while conditions continue to be challenging for us and the industry, we\u2019re encouraged by the continued strength and slight improvement in core pre-tax pre-provision earnings. The improvement in our capital and our loan loss reserve levels and we\u2019re pleased to have been able to acquire another bank in an FDIC assisted transaction that will further strengthen our strategic position in Southern California and will be immediately accretive to earnings without creating any strain on capital.", "With that, I think we will pause, give you a moment to organize your questions and then take another 15 or 20 minutes to try to respond.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "I guess one of the big concerns with Zions is that the balance sheet keeps getting a little bit more opaque each quarter and it\u2019s not a criticism. I realize you\u2019re working under some pretty unique issues and unique to put it lightly, accounting standards that are out there, but as we try to cut through the noise of discount accretion held-to-maturity versus available-for-sale, these bargain purchase gains.", "What are the key benchmarks you are focused on and you would focus investors on for the three core issues, which in my mind would seem to be whether you have enough capital? Whether credit deterioration is accelerating or decelerating and the long term earnings of the franchise is?", "Harris Simmons", "I\u2019ll start with the latter one. I think that the core net interest margin is critical, because that\u2019s the key driver of our ability to out of earnings observe ongoing cost of the other items that you mentioned, related to any other items without feeding too much into capital levels.", "So, because that the fact the core margin is still expanding even with some increase in NPLs and the fact that it expanded enough such that net interest income pre-provision increased despite the balance sheet shrinking is to me pretty critical and as long as that number stays in $950 million to $1 billion plus range, we are going to be pretty pleased at this point.", "The second credit quality, that\u2019s probably the single biggest driver of where we go from here, we don\u2019t probably and I don\u2019t know of any bank that does disclose enough information to get you fully comfortable with what\u2019s going on there. NPLs is not a complete guide they still increased on a gross basis at a fairly rapid rate, although on a net basis the dollar increase and the percentage increase was substantially smaller, meaning it is not getting ahead of us at an accelerated rate.", "We do try to give you some information about other underlying trends that\u2019s why I mentioned the early stage delinquencies, which were down, but the internal loan classification continue to increase, except certain areas. ", "It flattened out in Arizona and Nevada, where we\u2019ve been slogging away at this for the longest time and they also flattened out in Texas and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a trend or not at this point, but I think it is too early to tell whether we are a peak or inflection point and credit quality I guess there\u2019s some belief that things are still getting worse, but not quite at the same pace and that\u2019s somewhat encouraging.", "The impact of the other items, the accretions of this and the discretions of that, frankly there\u2019s nothing I could do about it other than explain them to you as clearly and carefully as I can which is so you can model them and that\u2019s what we have tried to do, Brian. I know it is complicated and that\u2019s unfortunately we living in a very complicated world these days, with both complicated real economic events as well as complicated and ever changing accounting standards that we are trying to apply to those events.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "", "I appreciate that and I think you guys have been very open about the impacts of all these things and how it is affecting the balance sheet and helping people think through that. If I could ask a quick follow-up in term of disposing of foreclosed real estate and in particular land.", "As we see some more hopeful signs in the housing market, are you seeing increased interest from builders and private investors and if so, do outright sales of land make more sense right now or are there things you can do like land bank strategies where they can buy options as opposed to buying a whole piece of land to help mitigate some of the downside on the balance sheet?", "Harris Simmons", "My first comment on that would be that we have continued so far to find it advantageous to workout credits one at a time and have not very far down the path of bulk sales of any kind of assets. ", "We did late last year look at the possibility of a bulk sale in Arizona of some problem real estate assets as a package of several dozen deals we ended up pulling all but a handful of those back off the market and frankly we have had success in working out those deals one at a time. Our experience is that we get about 75% or greater price on doing it one at a time than you\u2019ll find in bulk sales, substantially better than bulk sales.", "Doyle Arnold", "So, what we\u2019re trying to do in all our banks is significantly bulk up or workout staff. I transferred some lenders to workout and so forth. It is true that housing sales have picked up in some of these distressed markets. ", "Case-Shiller rate of decline and housing prices has slowed in some of these markets, but most of our issues are further back the food chain in construction and development and land loans and probably really hasn\u2019t had much impact on land prices yet at this point. Jerry, Harris, do you want to comment any further on that?", "Harris Simmons", "I think, we\u2019re seeing a little better sales activity probably in Phoenix than was the case three or six months ago. I think Las Vegas, as we\u2019ve commented in the last quarter or two as we\u2019ll have a ways to go.", "Jerry Dent", "I would just repeat that we are seeing, has been mentioned a lot better activity in getting the borrower to actually move the properties rather than bringing it into other risk they\u2019d own. I would also mention that we are seeing some of the larger builders starting to take a bigger interest in buying some of the selected pieces of improved land, or a lot where they pretty are already completed on lots, because they\u2019re now saying they want to make sure they have an inventory when we come out of this.", "Doyle Arnold", "They\u2019re being selective, but they\u2019re picking the best parcels in the places where they want to have inventory for when they think the turn is there and they think it\u2019s closer now than it was.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "I was hoping you could elaborate on what options you guys have by moving the securities from held-to-maturity into available-for-sale?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, it\u2019s really not an option that we necessarily plan to exercise in the very near future, but we had an opportunity legitimately because of actual events namely, deep downgrades of some of these securities and changing accounting standards to move them for available-for-sale without tainting the rest of the held-to-maturity category. You can do that when the event allows it, but then after that, you can\u2019t do it.", "So, if we hadn\u2019t moved them, any attempt to do anything with any one of these securities that we moved in the future would most likely taint the whole held-to-maturity category. So, while we don\u2019t necessarily have an immediate plan, we don\u2019t. This does give us the flexibility overtime to take advantage of whatever structures, options, prices, whatever may the market may present to us in the future and we wouldn\u2019t, if we had left them where they were.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "So, if you had left them where they were, you could have been at risk of having to write-down a larger portion of your held-to-maturity portfolio?", "Harris Simmons", "No, well all of it. If we subsequently disposed of one of these securities and it was still in held-to-maturity that really calls into question your intent and ability to hold to maturity, which is the definition of the category and that\u2019s a pretty bright line test that would likely cause both regulators and our external auditors and my controller who\u2019s sitting here to say the held-to-maturity category is now gone, as far as Zions is concerned for at least two years.", "Everything would have been treated as if it was AFS. Since these were the most deeply downgraded securities. They\u2019re the ones that we thought it advisable to have the best flexibility possible going forward, if we ever chose to do something without tainting the rest of the pool of higher quality assets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Leo Harmon - FMA.", "Leo Harmon - FMA", "Can you talk a little bit about the loss content embedded in aggregate, excluding the $41 million of sort of a one-time and trying to get an idea and get my arms around with the increase quarter-to-quarter, what piece of that was driven by increase in NPLs criticized, and what piece of that was driven by sort of a reevaluation of loss content across the portfolio?", "Harris Simmons", "I\u2019m sorry. What was the $41 million you mentioned? I got lost in your question I\u2019m sorry.", "Leo Harmon - FMA", "The reserve on the single loan of $41 million?", "Harris Simmons", "The single credit that we mentioned was not a reserve; it was a complete charge-off to zero. It was $47.5 million actually. So that was, set that aside and then what\u2019s the rest of the question?", "Leo Harmon - FMA", "So the rest of the question is going from 157 to 306 or approximately that amount, what piece of that was driven by an increase in NPLs and criticized loans and what piece was driven by the reevaluation of loss content across the portfolio?", "Harris Simmons", "The answer is, I don\u2019t have that answer. I can tell you that, there were three contributors. One was there was on the whole, a further increase classified loans during the quarter. I mentioned it leveled off in some places, but in the aggregate it was still up and classified loans are where the loans in which you believe there\u2019s the most potential for loss. So that was one driver.", "The second driver was that, if we\u2019ve reestimated not all, but a number of the loss content factors based on more recent experience. Particularly, there were increases in those loss content in CRE loans in some of the more distressed markets and that\u2019s probably what you would expect as this downturn has extended and we\u2019ve eaten through more of the collateral value and ability of borrowers to read margin, et cetera.", "We did not see on the whole much of an increase in those factors in C&I loans. In some cases they were actually lower than what we, the factors we traditionally have been using. So that was the second driver, and then the third was what we referred to in the release as the accounting approximate for the possibility that this down cycle may be a little longer and the loss realization cycle may be a little longer.", "So we balked at saying that, some people might say, we\u2019ve extended the year\u2019s coverage on average in the portfolio. We didn\u2019t think of it that way, but if that\u2019s what you choose to, that\u2019s not a bad rule of thumb. I don\u2019t have the relative components of those three things. Sorry.", "Doyle Arnold", "So those are for the provision. I think for the charge-offs themselves, it is sort of the $306 million. Actually, right around $300 million of net charge-offs. One way I\u2019d think about it is, if you look at the total C&I book, commercial book, it\u2019s, it had charge-offs of roughly 158 basis points annualized. ", "Consumer was at about 216 basis points annualized, with the largest piece of that being in one to four family residential and the commercial real estate portfolio had about 530 or so basis points of net charge-off, with most all of that being in the construction piece of it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Just following on that prior question, as we did think about your comments about still needing to or still thinking you might have additional reserve build in the future, I guess the question is, what are you not necessarily factoring in now that would allow you to still have to build, this is a pretty sizable $415 million addition. So, what are the categories I guess that you\u2019re watching the most for incremental deterioration both product-wise and then geography, please?", "Harris Simmons", "I think the biggest single one is continued significant declines in collateral values in Nevada and continued stress and strain there. So, we think that the total level of criticized and classified loans isn\u2019t increasing all of that much, but its getting the cost of resolving problems in that market is not getting better.", "For those who are familiar with what\u2019s going on in Las Vegas, it is probably one of the hardest hit markets in the country right now. So, that\u2019s maybe the biggest single thing to watch over the next couple of quarters is do we get through the peak of the losses there or do they continue to materialize.", "There\u2019s some increase in classified assets in pretty much all of our markets at this point that it will drive some increased provisioning, but again, we are not sure it is, we don\u2019t think it is going to you don\u2019t have all of those other factors at work that I just tried to articulate. So, I think that\u2019s probably the it will be more of the covers Nevada and continue to rise in classifieds into other markets.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America/Merrill", "Can you just really quickly touch on the migration of the book that you are seeing in Texas specifically are you did mention I think that you said that past dues were down a little bit, but that was a book you guys have grown a lot in the middle part of the decade. Can you talk about how that economy and how that portfolio is holding up specifically?", "Harris Simmons", "Do you want to try it or me?", "Doyle Arnold", "I think we have seen the significant increase in problem loans relative to where we were six or nine months ago is there has been a market slowing in the Houston economy as the energy industry has been pulling back in capital spending. We are not seeing sizable losses coming out of that at this point, but think that was certainly a driver in our building reserves this quarter was concern that slowing in that economy could lead to higher level of challenges down the road.", "So, it is still relative to many markets as measured by employment rates, both Texas as well as Utah and or Utah unemployment is about 5.7%, Texas is also reasonably low compared to national averages, but a lot of this has to do with just the fact that we are seeing slowing and we have seen this increase in potential problems that have yet to reading play themselves out as actual problems at this point.", "James Abbott", "We are past time we have quite a few questions queued Unidentified Participant out of deference to the lateness of the hour in the east, we will probably run another ten minutes for those and try to give you shorter answers, and no follow ups I apologize.

I didn\u2019t see in the press release and I was hoping you can provide us with that number, which is about $15 million last quarter and then also if you look at that portion of restructured loans which were not part of NPAs, which are part of accruing loans we just give us that number too.", "Harris Simmons", "I don\u2019t think we have that with us. Maybe James can try to get back to you after hours with that number.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dave Rochester - FBR Capital Markets.", "Dave Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Just real quick, for the CRE and commercial construction appraisals excluding the land loans you\u2019ve had to redo over the past quarter, can you give us a rough sense for how much of a devaluation you are seeing for the original appraisal values?", "Harris Simmons", "I should, it varies very widely by geography, like the most significant declines are in Las Vegas area, much less so in Colorado and Texas at this stage. Jerry, do you want to comment at all on that?", "Jerry Dent", "No, your comment is probably the best comment and that it varies so much by geography and especially by type of product as well. You get into some of the most hard hit markets and you are seeing 60% and 70% decline in the land and not near that in completed product, but it really just varies.", "Harris Simmons", "I saw some statistics this morning on CMBS outstanding. Moody\u2019s estimating the current loan to values are probably 20%. The implied valuable land rather of the loans is probably something collateral. It\u2019s probably down 20% something like that from a peak.

We\u2019ve seen in our term commercial real estate portfolio. The charge-offs in the quarter were $10.8 million. That\u2019s on a $6.8 billion portfolio. So, that\u2019s still running pretty good shape, its 64 basis points and it\u2019s higher than it has been, but it\u2019s not out of control yet.", "Dave Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Where are the strongest markets that you\u2019ve seen?", "Doyle Arnold", "Probably Utah, Texas still.

Just maybe kind of what\u2019s different in your both vis-\u00e0-vis, all these others?", "James Abbott", "It\u2019s best to say, I can\u2019t actually tell you what they\u2019ve done. I can tell you we have done and we have followed the general accounting principles and we have the in text model and we have modeled each of these and our assumptions have been vetted not only with the regulators, but also with our outside accountants and we\u2019re quite comfortable with the level 3 pricing that we\u2019re using.", "Doyle Arnold", "We tried to go through this before with all of our detailed assumptions and we\u2019re just going to stick with our methodology. We\u2019re not doing the fire sale, get it all behind us, take the deep distressed mark approach to this, which as James said trying to follow the consistent methodology and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "Just unrelated, I think in your comments you made the point that in terms of construction charge-offs, there\u2019s been a migration away from residential to more commercial? Is that plus out of it?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, at this quarter, yes there were just over $170 million of the total charge-offs were in real estate construction and about two thirds of that was commercial and about one third of it almost exactly two thirds/one third was residential. ", "Probably if you try to break it down by geography, over half of the commercial construction, in fact about 60% of it, those charge-offs came from Nevada, mostly Southern Nevada. Over half of the residential construction and these both include A&D loans, came from Arizona and the rest of it was all kind of spread around.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "What would you say that two thirds/one third mix was last quarter?", "Harris Simmons", "I don\u2019t know, unfortunately don\u2019t have that. I think it has been shifting probably from residential to commercial overtime, but I don\u2019t have the last couple of quarters here. I\u2019m sorry.", "James Abbott", "It had been, I think quite heavily toward residential back a couple of quarters. I think what you\u2019re seeing is consistent with what we suggested was likely to happen and that is, that you could see a cresting of the residential piece and the broadening of the loss in the commercial construction, and C&I portfolios for that matter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hecht - JMP Securities.", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "Doyle, you referred to observing CRE credit migration issues during the quarter and that\u2019s in part what drove the increase in the loss provision you had loss reserve. Can you give us a little more color and I guess that would be in a sense of, was the rate of change accelerating throughout the quarter in terms of migration issues? Were these cash flow derived credit issues, meaning vacancy related credit issues? Or were they mostly related to the property value?", "Doyle Arnold", "I think you misinterpreted what I said and I can understand given the words I said how you did that. It\u2019s my fault, not yours. I didn\u2019t say credit migration, I said loss migration. ", "I mean there was some deterioration in migration from pass grade to criticized, from criticized to classified et cetera, but when I use the word migration, what I was really referring to is loss estimation models that try to look at how much of substandard loans, how much of doubtful loans, how much of pass grade loans et cetera migrated to loss over various periods of time. ", "What I was referring to was that the actual loss realization in our CRE credits for any given level of classification had increased over what we had previously been modeling, based on newer loss data.", "Intuitively you would expect that. Early in the down cycle, with our conservative underwriting, with 50% loan to value ratios on land and 65% to 70% on completed properties et cetera, and with strong borrowers you have got collateral cushion and you\u2019ve got borrower support coming out of pocket to re-margin loans.", "Therefore your loss content for any particular level of stress in property value decline is mitigated by those things, but you get, as we are in Nevada and Arizona, maybe more so than other areas, deep into a protracted cycle, the cushion you have against loss from both of those sources begins to erode. So you expect to see the loss content in some other more distressed markets creep up and that\u2019s what I was trying to describe.", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "Okay. That makes with severity rates are higher, understood. I wanted to know on the prior question, can you give us a sense on the color of the pace of loans going into the classified asset category during the quarter?", "Doyle Arnold", "Continued to increase overall, but as I say, in moderation in Texas, Nevada, and Arizona, but I don\u2019t have data on kind of percentage rates of increases, et cetera.", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "Okay.

I\u2019m not saying that once we get through those we are done.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, but as of today that is still the case.", "Doyle Arnold", "That\u2019s what would happen, but yes.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "What markets give you the most concern as we move forward?", "Doyle Arnold", "All of them. It is still a pretty crummy economy out there and we are seeing deterioration in all of it. I think it\u2019s just really hard to say. We\u2019re going to start seeing we haven\u2019t had any losses in the Pacific Northwest in two or three years. We\u2019re going to have some over the next year because they have got declining real estate conditions up there.", "We are seeing deterioration in commercial nonresidential real estate in Southern California. There\u2019s softness in a few oil service borrowers in Texas, our energy service borrowers, as well as dramatic slowdown in the rate of housing development in Texas, which will probably cause some A&D losses there, but there\u2019s nothing yet that probably rises to the same loss content level that we\u2019ve seen in Arizona and Nevada not even close yet, at least yet, but we do expect them to rise in the other markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Klock - KBW.

DTA is an issue we have to manage and but we have levers to pull to manage that. So, it\u2019s going to be very difficult.

To my knowledge, none of them have raised the equity or done anything else.

Can you give us an idea of how much; have the charge at 50% or 60%?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, as I mentioned I think in the cases of Arizona and Nevada, we\u2019ve in a lot of properties have had particularly non-income producing properties we\u2019ve chewed through most or all of the equity and further property declines lead to almost dollar for dollar charge-offs in those situations. ", "That\u2019s not true across the Board in all geographies that are in different, parts of the credit cycle or didn\u2019t have property values as inflated by bubble pricing as those two, which may have falsely, not falsely, but just kind of led to an illusion of lower loan-to-values than might have really been there. Again, I mean\u2026", "Doyle Arnold", "When we have collateral dependent credits here, subject to the FAS 114 analysis, we\u2019re charging down to typically somewhere around 88%, in some cases as little as 80% of the appraised value of the new appraisal.", "Harris Simmons", "We are doing that in Arizona and Nevada specifically, taking a 20% haircut to the last appraisal.", "Doyle Arnold", "As to the loan to values, what we show are averages and there were some caveats because some of those are old appraisals done at the inception of the deal. The losses are quite clearly coming from the tails and not from the averages. Always have to remember that.", "James Abbott", "It is now, it is now about 7:00 in the East, so I think we are going to wrap this up now. I really am conscious of the time demands on all of you. We have allowed this to go over. I hope you don\u2019t mind that I was a complicated quarter. We wanted to give you as much information as possible.

Today's call is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, sir.", "James Abbott", "Thank you and good evening.  We welcome to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2009 earnings.  I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially.  We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.  We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call.  If you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available as an Adobe Acrobat file at ZionsBancorporation.com and can be easily downloaded and printed.", "We will limit the length of this call to one hour which will include time for you to ask questions.  During the Q&A session we will ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one followup question to enable other participants to ask questions.  I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you.  The environment remains reasonably challenging as you are seeing around the industry, especially as it pertains to some fundamental credit issues.  But we are encouraged by some positive signs that we are seeing and that we will be addressing here in the call.  One of those is that we are encouraged by the resiliency in our core pretax pre provision earnings.  Our net interest margin has remained strong and the core pretax pre provision earnings number continues to amount to a little more than $1 billion annually, which is consistent with what we have been experiencing in prior quarters.  ", "It would be maybe interesting for some of you to know that we have put into place incentive plans for about the 400 or so most senior officers in the company that are very focused on maintaining a strong pretax pre provision core earnings number, as well as reducing problem asset levels.  And we hope that that will have real motivational impact over the next seven or eight quarters as that incentive plan will run.", "I think it's notable that during the quarter we actually have seen some improvement in special mentioned loans, criticized loans that are sort of the first stage of deterioration before they move into more severe categories of substandard or doubtful.  We saw a 4% reduction in those special mentioned loans during the third quarter.  That was the third quarterly reduction since the second quarter of 2007.", "Additionally, while we saw some increase, about a 6.9% increase in classified loans during the third quarter, the increase is coming at a much reduced rate from prior quarters.  Going back to say the fourth quarter of last year, we had a 30% increase in that number, we had a 47% increase in classified loans, and the first quarter of this year was down to 16.3% in the second quarter and 6.9% in the third quarter.  So we do think we have a trend running here in terms of a diminishing volume of loans coming into these more severe classifications and that is certainly underscored by the improving level of special mention assets.", "It is also, I think, notable, that during the quarter we had about a 26% reduction in the beginning balance of classified assets.  You go back to those that were in place on June 30th, and before accounting for new assets, being identified as substandard or doubtful.  We actually had through charge offs, pay downs, and other forms of resolution, about a 26-percent decrease in that beginning balance so we are very proactively working through the problem pile even as we continue to identify some new problems that come along.", "It might be useful or of interest to you to know that as we look at the internal grating of our portfolio, we think that we are very much on top of that.  Regulators and our internal credit review staff are continually examining the portfolio and in recent reviews there have been relatively few downgrades from what our officers are actually recognizing in their portfolios, and we actually saw some loans upgraded as a part of this process by both regulators and our internal exam staff during this past quarter.  So we think that we are at a place now where we are very much recognizing the problems as they are occurring and I think we are very much on board with where those who independently look at those grades are finding the grading to be.", "We were very pleased during the quarter to see a significant growth in non interest bearing deposit balances.  This is one of the factors that contributed to a strong net interest margin during the quarter.  I think many of you are aware that during the quarter we continued to access the capital markets both through common equity and senior debt and we will continue to do so as the need arises.  ", "Our tangible common equity ratio declined 23 basis points to 5.43% during the quarter primarily because the balance sheet remains somewhat larger than desired due to excess liquidity which we are now working at actually running off or running down in the banks.  But I would note that all of our regulatory ratios strengthened during the quarter.  ", "We expect to continue to issue common equity through our ongoing distribution program as well as to manage the ratio through sales of loans or balance sheet attrition.  We certainly are mindful of, as we have stated in the past, of the need to be very watchful about diluting existing shareholders, but also keeping our capital at levels that are safe and sound.", "With that overview I will ask our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Doyle Arnold, to review the quarterly performance.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thank you, Harris.  Good afternoon and good evening, everyone.  First a quick overview to echo Harris's.  As noted in the press release, we posted a net loss applicable to (inaudible) on a GAAP basis of $179.5 million or $1.41 per diluted common share for the third quarter.  Our pretax pre credit cost earnings however did hold quite steady at around $1 billion annualized, which excludes several items that are unusual and lumpy that I will talk about when we go to the income statement.  ", "The reported GAAP net interest margin did decline from 4.09% last quarter to 3.91% this quarter, but as we discussed at length on last quarter's call, the NIM was going to be affected by several impacts related to the sub debt exchange that we initiative in June.  And if you pro forma'd the second quarter NIM, the 4.09% for those effects, you would have gotten to, and I think most of you did, to a third quarter NIM or an adjusted NIM of 3.82%.  ", "So the fact that we posted a 3.91% margin meant that the core net interest margin showed improvement of about nine basis points.  ", "This was primarily driven by a reduction in the cost on interest bearing deposit accounts.  The cost declined by about 25 basis points compared to the second quarter, and yet another strong increase in average non interest bearing deposits.  All this was partly offset by a decline in loan yields as nonaccrual loans did increase and weighed on the portfolio.", "The allowance for total credit losses was $221 million.  Some of that was the A Triple L and some was the expense related to unfunded commitments or about $1.07 per share, and I think we had guided you to expect that the provisions for credit cost this quarter would again exceed net charge offs, but by a smaller amount than last quarter by a couple of hundred million.  So I think that is about where we ended up we thought we would.  ", "We are now heavily influenced in determining our credit provisions by the most recent more severe loss experience, typically just in the last 6-12 months and the provision is being totally driven by that experience, not the previous lower charge off levels earlier in the cycle.", "During the past two quarters we have increased the allowance for credit losses by nearly $650 million and we think we now have one of the strongest reserve levels among regional banks.", "During the quarter we did update the way we forecast future defaults for banks within our CDO pools.  These are the bank trust preferred CDOs that are the focus of a lot of attention.  As time passes we have an increasingly significant dataset of failed banks in this cycle which improves our ability to backtest various statistical regression to see which financial ratios are the best predictor of future failures for the private banks names in these pools.  ", "As you recall, we use a third party publicly available default model for the performing banks whose stocks are publicly traded, but our updated private bank model now has a very strong correlation with actual bank failures and in most third quarter defaults, had probabilities of default in the high 90-pecent range based on the second quarter ratio analysis, and that is a significantly more highly correlate than actual failures in our previous reliance on LACE ratings, and we are no longer using LACE ratings to estimate PDs for private bank names.", "Using this updated analysis, the impairment for the entire securities portfolio was $198 million, split between $142 million of OCI which may be recaptured if discount rates fall and/or cash flows improve, and $57 million of credit related OTTI.  ", "The OCI mark primarily reflects the fact that we are using higher discount rates for the liquidity impairment on original single A rated and original triple B rated securities in prior quarters.  And we will come to, in a minute, the actual carrying values that we are now carrying those securities at.", "Okay.  Turning briefly to some of the schedules attached to the press release, page 13.  At the end of last quarter we said that we would be trying to shrink the balance sheet.  We were unable to do that this quarter and it actually grew by over half a billion dollars.  Partly that was due to the Vineyard acquisition that occurred in July, partly because the overall size of the balance sheet is being driven by the liabilities, not the assets.  It was increased by the senior debt that we issued during the third quarter, and in general, just a continued strong liquidity of the banks and the parent in the aggregate.  ", "And you can see that, for example, money market investments, interest bearing deposits, and commercial paper were $2.2 billion up from $1.0 billion last quarter.  And just in general, liquidity was up by many hundreds of millions of dollars.  ", "Just to kind of scale this for you, for every billion dollars of asset size we have given a same amount of tangible common equity, that has an 11 basis point impact on the TCE ratio.  So greater by a billion means TCE down by 11 basis points.  ", "Turning to page 14, consolidated statements of income, as Harris mentioned, the poor pretax pre credit cost to earnings remains steady at about $1 billion.  We excluded several major items that appear on this page from that calculation.  ", "In particular, the fair value and non-hedged derivative income of $59 million which largely rose from again, terminating ineffective interest rate swaps.  We excluded that.  We excluded the securities impairments, and then you can see the $146 million acquisition related gain.  That is all due to Vineyard.  We told you at the time of the acquisition that we expected that gain to be comfortably in excess of $100 million and it was $146.2 million.  And we also excluded from getting to that $1 billion number, the (inaudible) expense of $30 million since that is, in effect, a credit cost and bounces around a bit from quarter to quarter.", "Page 17 and 18 the investments securities portfolio, we are again providing you here with a great deal of information about the securities portfolio.  But I think in future press releases we are going to relegate these particular tables to the 10-Q.  They are very difficult to put together and tie out in a timely fashion for public disclosure purposes, and also I am not sure that people are finding them that useful.  What we did try to do, if you will turn back to page six of the press release, we tried to collapse this all down into three lines of what we think are highly relevant and important numbers.  We took the bank trust preferred CDO portfolio and organized it by the original grades of the securities that we have, not the current grades, but the original grades. ", "We know we have gotten criticized by some for not marking our CDOs to the level of some of our peers, but we do want to highlight and think this table highlights the fact that 58% of the par amount that we have was originally Triple A rated which we think is rather higher on the quality scale than that of \u2014", "James Abbott", "Fifty-two.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'm sorry, what did I say, 58?  I am sorry, 52%.  And because there is such a very strong level of overcollateralization on the Triple As, it is highly probably that there will be very little credit lost on these securities, and therefore it is reasonable that we could realize maturity or realize full value \u2014 par at maturity.", "But they are held at $0.69 on the dollar and that is primarily because when we purchased them out of Lockhart funding.  That was our off balance sheet QSPE.  They had to be purchased at a discount, an interest rate mark, at fair value, at the time.  So the rest of the portfolio there is a sizable amount of original single As that are now marked to $0.37 and the original triple B rated CDOs are now marked at 25% of par.", "If you're in the camp that believes the original triple As are likely to have very little credit impairment and you apply the $355 million discount that we are currently carrying the original triple As at.  If you applied that discount to the single As and the triple Bs, those trenches would be carried net in the low single digits.  So basically we think the whole portfolio is now marked pretty fairly.  ", "We turn to page 20.  I think you can go through the usual numbers.  We do want to point out that near the middle of the page just above the reconciliation of the allowance and reserve for credit losses, if you look just above that, we have added four new lines.  We have added accruing loans 30 to 89 days past due, excluding those from FDIC support assets, and then the 30 to 89 day passed dues in the FDIC supported assets.  And then just below that, the last two lines, we have given you restructured loans that are included in the nonaccrual loans above and then also, restructured loan that are on accrual at quarter end.  ", "So, some information that a lot of you ask about and we have now just included in the table \u2014 you are going to hear a few \u2014 did not look \u2014 we did not do the math for you here, but non performing asset formation has been fairly steady over the last few quarters.  It actually drifted down a little bit this quarter, probably too soon to call that a definitive trend, but basically it is at least holding now steady.", "As Harris mentioned, special mention loans declined during the quarter and the classified asset growth was in a mid-single digits kind of growth rate.", "Again I will point out the A Triple L increased to $1.433 billion, up $185 million, and is now 3.61% of net loans and leases and 79% of nonperforming loans . And the total reserve bill, including the unfunded commitment allowance was $221 million, up to $1.53 billion.", "Next page, page 21, another new schedule.  Many of you asked for hat so here it is.  This is nonaccrual loans for the last five quarters by loan type.  You will note that the rapid increase in construction and land development loans that we've experienced in former quarter has somewhat flattened out. Also the CNI loans somewhat flattened.  The two increases that are ongoing appear to be coming from the owner occupied commercial and from the commercial term, both of which have, we believe, had lower loss content than the construction loans which have been driving most of our losses.  ", "In fact, once again just under 60% of total losses, I believe it is just over half of total losses this quarter, again came out of the construction and land development category.", "Page 22, the average balance sheet, we already talked about this.  Margin 3.9%, you can see the total interest bearing deposit cost declined by 25 basis points.  I will point out one number that will jump out at the page at you when you get to it, long-term debt average rate 9.9% up from 3.3% in the prior quarter.  That is the effect of the subordinated debt that converted to preferred stock during the quarter, i.e. that exercised the conversion option.  And we immediately accrete back all of the discount that was taken on the debt back through interest expense, and that is where it shows up, most glaringly is on that particular line item.", "On page 24 we give you capital ratios with ate cautionary note that the risk-based capital ratios are still estimates.   The capital is not an estimate, but the risk-based assets or the dominator is what is an estimate.", "The tangible common equity ratio declined primarily because the balance sheet grew and also because of the greater than expected OCI marks on the securities in part reflecting the change in the way we got to the assumptions on defaults and deferrals.", "The risk-based capitals ratios all were up slightly however, because the balance sheet growth was in very low risk, therefore low-risk rated assets.  We were satisfied that our efforts during the quarter to issue equity helped maintain overall very stable ratios.", "Okay.  Some guidance for the next couple of quarters; we expect loan balances organically to continue to decline and we would expect modest overall shrinkage in the balance sheet.  We do expect continued solid NIM performance in the fourth quarter and as we do think there is still room to reprice funding costs down and improve the funding mix as well as were able to hold loan pricing up fairly solidly.  And as a general statement, the balance sheet does remain fairly asset sensitive.", "Credit quality based on the moderate increase in classified assets, we do expect NPAs to continue to increase in the fourth quarter, although the rate of change is likely to continue its decelerating trend.  Fourth quarter net charge offs may likely be similar to the third quarter.  Factors that could cause an increase would an overall higher level of NPAs as well as possible trend towards higher severity levels in some loan categories, but the mitigating factors may be that the composition of NPAs, as I mentioned, has begun to shift away from the high severity loans like construction and development and tort loans that typically have lower severity such as our owner occupied CRE and investor-owned term CRE.", "We expected provision to again exceed net charge offs in the fourth quarter, but based on the data available today we would expect the overt provision to be less in the fourth quarter than the third quarter amount.  So credit cost should continue to decline, but probably still in excess of actual charge offs.  ", "Also, the charge to noninterest expense for unfunded commitments is likely to be significantly lower in the fourth quarter because the third quarter's expense was largely due to the completion of the one-time updating of several of the major loss factors in the model.", "In the securities impairment area we expect a more moderate adverse impact to TCE in the fourth quarter which is the combination of the after-tax impact of OTTI and any adverse change in OCI.  As the change in assumptions within the model were relatively major in the third quarter, but we expect only small refinements in the future.", "So in summary, while conditions continue to be challenging for us in the industry, we are encouraged by the steady pretax pre credit cost earnings, a loan loss reserve that is quite strong, and a noticeable slowing of the growth in classified assets.", "With that, I think we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir.  (Operator's Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks.  Can you just talk about the environment right now or the market for potential loan sales and I guess also address the agreement that you have with the OCC in terms of keeping your classified assets over your Tier 1 plus reserves to 100% and where do you stand on that currently?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, to answer the second one first, there is no agreement with the OCC that requires us to get that ratio.  What I have said is that it is a ratio that is of keen interest to the regulators, but there is no formal requirement that we hit that or any other particular ratio.  I think on the whole we are probably right around that ratio around the 100% level.  It varies a bit by bank, but that would be the other to that question.", "In terms of loan sales, I think the best way to address that would be first of all to say that we work through about 26% of total classified assets.  If you take the classified asset balances at the end of the second quarter, before any new inflows, we resolve 26% of those balances in the third quarter.  Some of that was pay down, some of that was sales, some of it was charge offs, et cetera.  Now, actual loan sales in the third quarter were a bit over $100 million that the two biggest components of that would be coming from California and from Nevada.  And again, primarily those reflect basically selling one note at a time, not bulk loan sales.  Did you want to have a followup on that, Ken, if I missed the mark?", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "No.  I think you got it.  I would have a followup, but sort of off the subject a little bit.  The one thing I was just curious about was given your expectation for further reserve build, would you consider revising the pace at which you are raising the additional equity to accelerate that in coming quarters?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, we raised about $188 million I believe it is in net common in the third quarter.  And if I gross that is up $250-$275 million of loss and charge off.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "I guess I was thinking specifically about the most recent $250 million ATM offering.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I think we will probably use that over one or two more quarters, but we will meter it out as we think appropriate.  There is not a particular number or ratio that we are trying to hit, but I think you would probably look for another significant issuance this quarter of over $100 million and maybe $150 million, but I am not sure we will use all of it this quarter.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great.  Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from David Rochester with FBR Capital Markets.", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets and Co.", "Hey, guys.  How are you?  You mentioned completing the implantation of loss factors this quarter.  Can you talk about what portion of the total provision for your on balance sheet exposure as well as for the unfunded commitment that was, and can you go into how many of your sub banks were impacted by that?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Probably cannot answer the specific question.  I will just say that on a net basis, substantially all of the reserve build was in California and Nevada which were the two biggest banks that we did not fully apply that methodology to last time.", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets and Co.", "Okay.  And di you ultimately end up pushing any capital down to any of those banks this quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes.  We did a number of capital actions at the bank level.  We converted a little over a half a billion dollars of subordinated debt at various other banks and to Tier 1 capital as a sub debt that as been issued to the parent.  In addition we pushed a couple hundred million of capital to Nevada and a smaller amount to Texas to the amount of about $80 million into Amery Bank in Texas.  That will all come out in the call reports, I just do not happen to have the full schedule here.", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets and Co.", "Sure.  So that I guess was the entire balance of the $510 million or so of sub debt outstanding at the holding company level?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That the holding company owned yes, that is substantially all of it.", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets and Co.", "Okay.  All right, thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Thanks and good evening.  Just first on M&A, I am just wondering if you can comment on your desire to do additional FDIC assisted deals here, especially in light for your desire to shrink the balance sheet.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "The two are not explicitly linked because the last deal that we did was self capitalizing and at the bargain purchase gain essentially capitalized the increase in the balance sheet.  But what is limiting our capacity \u2014 I mean we are still, as we said last quarter, we are taking a pause.  We have got over $2 billion of assets to work out and frankly we have not seen another one that was even remotely tempting to us in the last few months.  The quality of the franchise that are going under now is not very good.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Got it.  And if I could just ask one additional question.  The delinquency level was up a little bit sequentially, but it looks like your classified loans that you say on the call has improved.  What does that mean in the past from P&L growth a few quarters out?", "Doyle L. Arnold", " Well, this cycle is so without precedent really, that it is hard to extrapolate from the past.  I guess we would expect that if we are doing our job right, the classifications downgrade should precede movement into non performing status which should precede the losses.  So the fact that criticize and classify appear to be peaking, it probably means that those other things are not that far behind one or two quarters maybe in terms of peaking.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Great.  Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "And we will go next to John Pancari with Fox-Pitt Kelton.", "John Pancari - Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran LLC", "Good evening.  Could you give us some color on the increase in owner occupied in term CRE non performers?  Specifically what market did you see the increase and what are some of the trends you are seeing, and particular on the owner occupied set.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "Well, the owner occupied I think comes out of our \u2014 I think it is mostly here in our Utah bank.  This again is the kind of low loan to value SBA 504 or 504-like small business owner occupied loans.  It is a national program that is run out of the bank here in Utah.  So the specific geographies around the country I am not sure about.  The largest component of that portfolio is actually in California, followed by various other western states, and then nationally.  And the last content remains \u2014 I mean, the actual loss realization remains way below 1% on an annualized basis right now.  It has been creeping upward and it looks like it might get to 1% or a bit more than that before we're done but currently it's well under that.  ", "So does that give you the answer on owner occupied?", "John Pancari - Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran LLC", "Yes.  It does.  And then on CNI?", "Harris Henry Simmons", "You mean on the term?", "John Pancari - Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran LLC", "I guess I would ask about both term CRE and CNI.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "Okay.  The geography for the \u2014 I am not sure we know.  I think \u2014 let us see.  Why do we not take another question?  We will fumble around here and look and see if we can come up with a geography specific answer on that.  Sorry.", "John Pancari - Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran LLC", "Okay.  Good, that is not a problem.  I will ask a related question then.  It looks like you just indicated that you follow an additional amount of capital back to the Texas sub, to Amery.  It looks like the second quarter that you did that.  Can you talk about that a little bit?  Are you seeing mounting pressure there on the credit side that is giving you the rationale hereby you are going to find more capital down there?", "Harris Henry Simmons", "Yeah. We have seen an increase and criticized and classified in nonperforming assets in Texas \u2014 fairly substantial over the last few quarters.  Their general sentiment in Texas is not that things are about to start improving but that the rate of that deterioration is beginning to slow meaningfully.  We saw that kind of ramp up in other markets, but earlier, and Texas later to the party.  But yes, that is primarily that has been driving those capital ratios.  ", "If we have a coherent answer to your question, we will come back and interject it later in the call or you can followup with James later.", "John Pancari - Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran LLC", "Will do.  Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Todd Hagerman of Collins Stewart.", "Todd Hagerman - Collins Stewart", "Good afternoon, everybody.  Hey, Doyle, just wondering go back to your comments on the reserve.  If I understand it right, you have added in excess of $600 million to  the reserves the last couple of quarters.  There has been some shift in recent quarters in terms of the waiting and recent loss migration, but how should we think about it in terms of with the acceleration on the commercial side that we are saying, particularly in CNI, and presuming that the loss factors would have gone up across the board, what does that mean for the reserve build going forward?  Particularly since your reserve coverage is still kind of around that high 70 kind of coverage of nonperforming loans with commercials continuing to increase.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I tried to indicate that we do expect another over provision this quarter, but we think that we are nearing the end of that sometime in maybe the next couple of quarters.  The increase in non performers was still heavily skewed toward that owner occupied commercial and again, the loss content in that even applying just the most recent loss experience is still extraordinarily low and we have no indication that it is going to spike up dramatically from there.", "So the rest of the CNI is pretty stable.  It has been between $200-$250 million for the three quarters in a row now. So all of the increase in CNI is coming from there, and most of the increase in commercial is coming out of commercial term where we have seen some increases in losses.  We had a couple of casino real estate secured loans in the most recent quarter go bad, but as a general matter, we do think the loss content in that is lower than in the construction and land development component of CRE.", "Todd Hagerman - Collins Stewart", "Okay.  And if I may just a followup to that then.  I mean, what about that there is a lot of discussion obviously currently in terms of the differences between the GAAP accounting and the formula approach to some of the reserves and perhaps increasing regulatory pressure on the reserves particularly given the absolute level of problem assets.  What can you say just in terms of those discussions that you are having now with the regulators and just kind of how to think about reserves in the coming quarters or year in terms of absolute levels.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I am not sure what you are alluding to even there.  I would say I have no ideation that the regulators are dissatisfied wither with our level of reserves or the methodologies that we are using to derive that reserve.  ", "Harris Henry Simmons", "I do not think there is a gap between their view and GAAP accounting. I mean that is basically \u2014 we are applying loss factors from graded credits and over the last several quarters and \u2014", "Doyle L. Arnold", "If what you are trying to ask, Todd, is two years out after the peak of the cycle, how is the SEC and the Fed and the FASBI going to resolve the pro cyclicly, or if the Fed has its way or if the regulators had their way, the lack of pro cyclicly in the reserving process.  I do not know.  I will stay tuned like you will.", "Todd Hagerman - Collins Stewart", "No.  I mean that is part of it.  I guess I am just more focused just in terms of the absolute mathematics between again, kind of the concentration on the commercial real estate side and is as that starts to trend lower, but the bucket in part continues to fill in terms of inflow of problem assets.  Does the absolute level still come down byte pure mathematics as opposed to even though the NPAs continue to go up?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I think what we are really looking at is the actual loss migration using the most recent and therefore most relevant time periods, particularly in this unprecedented cycle.  I mean we are not looking back farther than 12 months now and much of this is being driven by the most recent six months loss history and that is likely to remain the case until we clearly have very clear and compelling evidence that we are over the crest of this hill and then we will decide how do you start to normalize this over a whole cycle as opposed to making sure that the reserve is adequate for these peak losses.", "Todd Hagerman - Collins Stewart", "Okay.  Fair enough, thanks.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "Thank you.  Good afternoon.  I want to be careful not to put words in your mouth, but I think you made the comment that we do not want any agreements with the regulators with respect to specific ratios.  Was that meant to say there is agreements in place that do not have specific ratios involved in them (laughter)?  ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes.  And I stopped beating my wife last Tuesday.  How do I answer that question?  I mean look, we have lots of discussions with the regulators.  I am not going to comment on agreements with regulators or lack thereof.  I am just saying, I got to ask the specific question alluding to the fact that I had said there were agreements that had that ratio in it, and that is not the case, and that is as far as I am going to go.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "That is helpful.  And then secondly, with respect to the slowdown in increase of criticized assets, could you maybe talk some color on the composition of that?  Is it kind of similar to what you are seeing in terms of MPAs where construction-line development may be declining and you are starting to see an increase in unoccupied (inaudible) CRE or just maybe flush out the kind of endowment for that?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yeah.  I think the clearest turn is in Arizona by geography, where we are clearly criticized and classifieds are both trending solidly downward.  The criticized and classifieds have flattened in Nevada.  We still have a very high rate of charge off coming out of what is there and as a general statement, residential construction and development in California, Arizona, and Nevada, are the source of most of that flattening or decline in criticized and classified.  Those are the most clear cases where those trends have turned for the better.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "And I would say the clearest increase remains in various geographies in commercial construction and development CRE where they are still increasing.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Bob Patten with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Hey, guys.  Just about all my questions have been asked.  Just I guess coming back to the margin, Doyle, when you said it was going to be solid.  Are you looking at on a core bounce from what we saw from second and third quarter this quarter and going into the third and fourth quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think the bias in the core margin would still be slightly upward in the fourth quarter, yes.", "Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Is it the same delta?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Who knows?  I do not know.  I just think there is still room \u2014 all right, I get there this way.  I think there will be a moderating increase in NPLs and so there will still be a drag there, it just will not be the headwind getting a little weaker each quarter in terms of the rate of increase, and there is still room to reprice the funding costs, and potentially to shrink the balance sheet from the liability side, all of which would tend to improve the margin.", "Now once again, we still have some sources of noise.  From the sub debt modification we have, I believe it is next month, another election date for conversion into a sub debt in a preferred stock.  You saw the impact on one little line of funding and therefore on the margin from $27 million this quarter.  I have no idea what that number will be next quarter.", "Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay.  You do not now the amount that is up?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No.  I know how much \u2014 I mean, the amount that can convert is in the many hundreds of millions.  I have no idea how much we will elect to convert.", "Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay.  Gotcha.  And then just on the deferred tax asset, it's a good percentage of your tangible common, any thoughts around having to take a valuation of the allowance or are you just continuing to look at it?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think it was $688 million up this quarter from about $640 million in the second quarter.  As we get deeper into the cycle we'll have to continue to look at it and test the justification for not taking  a valuation allowance as it may become more formalized over the next few quarters and it has been until now, but I don't think I will \u2014 I remain pretty confident that I won't have to take one.  ", "I will just note that for those who want, there is an estimate of how much, for regulatory purposes, was disallowed this quarter.  And that is $122 million of regulatory capital purposes up from $59 million last quarter.  It's in the same three banks, but these numbers are probably not finalized yet, but they will be by the time of the call report; $67 million in Nevada, $26 million in Arizona, and $29 million in California Bank and Trust.  That is the disallowed regulatory DTA.", "Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Thanks, Doyle.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Brian Klock with KBW.", "Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.", "Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Thanks for taking my call.  I did have a few of my questions answered already, bu I guess sort of onto the DTA question and we think about when the timing differences will reverse.  What is your outlook that ties into when you think of return of profitability?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "You are asking me when I think I will return to profitability?", "Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.", "Yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Sometime next year, roughly speaking in the middle.", "Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.", "Okay.  And I guess with that, obviously the regulatory accounting is a little more bright lined than the accounting testing of your look backs and when it becomes (inaudible) et cetera.  But as of this point you are saying you don't think even before year end you would have to more formally test the DTA?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No.  We have talked about, I believe, at a conference recently, all these hedging strategies related to asset liability management and securities that would have an ancillary benefit of realizing operating tax losses that would help mitigate any DTA disallowance issues.  And we are continuing to pursue those and think that we will execute some of those hedging strategies this quarter.", "Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.", "Okay.  And wouldn't you still need to generate taxable income in that quarter though, in order to realize that tax benefit?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No.  Because we can carry it back against operating losses (inaudible) gains operating income, so (inaudible) operating and loss carryback to 2007 and 2008 taxes paid.", "Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.", "Okay.  All this talk about DTA is getting you choked up so I will just ask one other question.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It is.  It's my favorite topic.", "Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.", "All right.  I appreciate all the extra disclosure this quarter on the NPLs by category, the TDRs, et cetera, do you actually have the gross inflows into NPL in the quarter?  We have got the net change, we have got net charge offs?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It is between $650-$700 million.  What we should do is give you the number and tell you exactly how we calculated it.  All we did was add and subtract numbers from page 20.  So essentially \u2014 wait a minute.  This is not accruals.  New loans that went to nonaccrual were $873 million.  Is that the number you are looking for?", "Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.", "Yes.  And your call reports last quarter, I think it was 863.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes.  So it is down a little bit.", "Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.", "Okay.  And then one last question and I will try to get out of here.  Harris, you mentioned earlier the level of classified loans and the rate has decreased over the last few quarters.  Can you give us the balance of those classified loans at the end of the third quarter?", "Harris Henry Simmons", "No.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "Yes we can, but no we won't.", "Brian Klock - Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.", "Okay.  I thought I would try.  Thanks for taking my call (laughter).", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Larry Zatal  (ph) with More Capital (ph).", "Larry Zatal - More Capital", "Hi, thanks.  Doyle, you've spoken in the past about trends in the intermountain west.  I guess Colorado, Oho, Utah, and how those markets were starting to show signs of weakness.  Can you bring us up to date on that?  ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I do not know.  Harris, do you want to take a crack at that one or do you want me to?", "Harris Henry Simmons", "You start and I will chime in.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Let's see.  I think they are still deteriorating, they are still in general in better shape than the national average.  For example, the Utah unemployment rate I think is 6.2% compared to national average of very close to 10 now.  You are starting to see some actual pickup in residential construction activity again in Utah.  Corresponding with that, there is still a lot of foreclosures.  I think Utah has one of the 10 highest foreclosure rates in the country still, and it is generally the case that consumer credit weakens more in Utah than in other states in a downturn.", "At the same time, our home equity portfolio which is largely Utah and most of our mortgage portfolio, continue to perform very, very well,.  In Colorado we have had a sharp increase in criticized and classified there in the last couple of quarters and I think it is going to moderate, but clearly the recession is coming to Colorado as well.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "But not large.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yeah.  It is a sharp increase, but relatively small ballers in the total sense.  What else would you want to add?  Do you have a specific question or \u2014", "Larry Zatal - More Capital", "No.  I mean you have given us color on that in the past.  I just was hoping for an update and you have done that.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I think the Utah economy is maybe the strongest of all the economies we are operating in.  Texas still remains, I think, in reasonable shape.  The rig count is actually back up from its bottom and that is encouraging.  But there is still weakness all around.  I think small businesses are feeling this and certainly consumers have a ways to go and commercial real estate is going go take another two or three quarters, I think, to play out.", "Larry Zatal - More Capital", "Okay.  And I just simply forget, have you had to put capital down to Zion's First National Bank?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We converted some subordinated debt during the quarter into preferred.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "Yeah.  A couple hundred million and probably we'll have to put a little bit more than there before this is all over.", "Larry Zatal - More Capital", "Okay great.  Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America", "Thanks.  Two quick one, guys, I know we're at the end here.  First question, Doyle, on the bank CDO portfolio, with the revised methodology, do you have an updated look on what you expect future OTTI to be?  I know you said you'd be able to model it better, but has that altered your expectation of the potential future loss?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think what you are seeing this quarter is a bit of a one-time change in approach reflecting the modeling and I would not expect a repeat of this level of OTPI and OCI in the next couple of quarters, but I would expect some more of each, but maybe back to more moderate levels again, but it is hard to know.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "The model is really sensitive to deferrals more so than really defaults and so it is really subject to how many new banks the regulators require of them to stop paying their interest on their trust preferred.  And in fact, in the third quarter that number is down from the second quarter and so we are actually encouraged that there seems to be fewer new deferrals so we think we need another quarter here to make sure it is a trend, but it is actually encouraging.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America", "Okay.  And then secondly, you mentioned this $250 million kind of core pre tax pre provision run rate, are you expecting that to just kind of be the new run rate?  I mean is there anything that would get it to \u2014 what would you need to see to see it actually start increasing?  And there was a lot of one-time items you have to tease out to even get to 250, but do you expect it to kind of stay there or what are the risks and positive potentials to grow it over time?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Loan growth or loan shrinkage is probably the biggest near-term swing factor once we get through with the repricing opportunities in the funding side of the balance sheet.  There is nothing in the nature of our non interest income that, other than these unusual items like the swap, which we have excluded from this, is susceptible to dramatic increases or it's not like we have big capital markets or investment banking markets \u2014 it goes from no profits to a lot of profits on a quarterly basis.  ", "So the bigger driver is going to be when the loan demand begins to stabilize and pick up again leading to loan balance stabilization and growth again.", "Harris Henry Simmons", "Well, bringing down nonaccrual loans is part of it.  I mean that is probably a $100 million drag right now.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America", "On the margin, right.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.", "James Abbott", "We have got time.  Let's take one more question and then there looks like there is a few people still waiting in the queue so this is James, just give me a call and I'll get back in touch with you.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir.  And we'll take our final question from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Securities Inc.", "Hey, everyone . I actually just had one question for Doyle.  We have had a couple of quarters now of one-time gains which have come at a pretty good time, given the way provision and where OTTI impairments have come in.  Doyle, I am just wondering, when you look out into your crystal ball, do you see any one time gains out there on the horizon?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Nothing of the magnitude of the Vineyard acquisition.  And we tried to be pretty up front about that one by telling you we thought it would be well north of $100 million.  The one that we may see some more of is the swap.  I think the line item is non hedge derivative income and that was $58 million this quarter.  That's coming out of the termination of swaps which have become ineffective for FAS 131 purposes because each of the pools that we had has to be homogenous in terms of the pricing characteristics.  So it has to be a pool of LIBOR plus 200 loans or prime plus 50.  Everything in there has to be like that.  And those loans pay down in a pool and then are replaced \u2014 the new loans we are making are at wide spreads generally, than the loans that we hedged.  The hedges on those pools become ineffective and they're torn up.  ", "We have, today, I think it is $100 million roughly of unrealized gains on FAS 133 hedges, sitting out there, yet one portion of which could be realized in this quarter or next as long as interest rates stay low and spreads on new loans stay higher.  So that is the one source of potentially ongoing gains.  And $100 million today is about the amount.  I wouldn't think all of that would be realized in one quarter, but some of it could.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Securities Inc.", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Before we sign off here, I am going to let you do this, Geri, but there was  a question earlier that we were unable to answer that we will \u2014 why don't you try to restate the question, Geri, and give the answer.", "Gerald J. Dent", "It related to where the concentrations were in the real estate non accruals, and Doyle pretty well answers the question as it relates to owner occupied.  So the remaining question is with respect to term theory loans and what the source of that is.  Primarily the bulk of it is coming out of our Nevada banks.  The other banks are really a pretty small amount in that grant total.  So the answer would really be out of Nevada.  ", "James Abbott", "I was just going to add a little bit of color on that is it could be related to the gaming industry where we have seen some of the bigger problems out of term commercial real estate.", "Gerald J. Dent", "That is accurate.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Could be, would be, is be \u2014 all right, I think we are going to wrap it up today and James will sig us off here I guess.", "James Abbott", "All right.  Thanks, everyone for joining the call, and for those of you that were on the call that still had questions, we are going to try to keep it to an hour because we receive heavy complaints when we go over the hour so I will call you back in the hour that you had dialed in.  Thank you.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thanks, James.", "Operator", "Thank you.  That does conclude today's conference.

This call is being recorded. Now for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to James Abbot.", "James Abbott", "Thanks Anthony and good evening everyone. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2009 earnings. I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. If you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available at www.zionsbancorporation.com and can be easily downloaded and printed. We will limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q-and-A section, we ask you limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris", "Harris Simmons", "Thank you very much, James and good afternoon or good evening depending on your location. We\u2019re delighted to have you with us today to talk about our fourth quarter results. We will join others who have reported this quarter and generally in commenting that market conditions for our banking subsidiaries are starting in many cases to show some signs that are encouraging to us, but obviously it remains a very fragile recovery that we were in and we expect that we will continue to see some stress over the next couple of quarters or so.", "As you likely have seen, we reported a fourth quarter net loss to common shareholders of $1.26 per share. We believe that 2009 represents the trough in earnings for this credit cycle and we expect to see an improvement in profitability as we progress through 2010. While the economic environment remains fragile, there are signs that emerging it\u2019s stabilizing somewhat.", "We\u2019re consequently increasingly confident that loan losses have likely peaked and we believe we\u2019re on the down slope through net charge-offs and for provision expense for our loan loss reserves. It\u2019s unlikely that such items will decline in a straight line from the peak and certainly there remain some key areas that we\u2019re monitoring and working to reduce our risk profile, but in general we believe the credit cost will be significantly less in 2010 than they were in 2009.", "As we noted in the press release, net charge-offs declined significantly compared to the prior quarter, they were down 23%. We did recover most of our exposure on the Flying J loan. We typically don\u2019t mention loans by name, but this one has been publicly reported and so we would note that we sold our note to a third party and recovered about $0.83 on the dollar. Excluding that recovery, net charge-offs declined about 13%.", "During 2009, we built the allowance for credit losses by more than $900 million or about $4.75 per share. The allowance for credit losses to loans equaled 4.25% and exceeded our fourth quarter annualized net charge off ratio by a comfortable margin. Although, non-accrual loans increased modestly in the fourth quarter, the composition of these credits is much less concentrated in construction loans that typically have had much higher severity of loss rates and is more concentrated in loans that are better secured or often have better cash flows and thus typically have a lower loss severity.", "During the quarter, we resolved about 25% of our September 30, balance of classified assets, which about 70% resulted in a favorable resolution. In other words, without charge off or charge down and that said is a rate that is very similar to the rate we experienced in third quarter. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of these problems being worked out as we go through time here. However, classified loan levels were relatively flat with the prior quarter as loans were downgraded during the quarter to offset those being resolved.", "With the stabilization of classified loans, we believe the need to build the reserve in 2010 should be quite modest, if this trend continues. We\u2019re also pleased with the continued improvement in our equity ratios with our tangible common equity increasing to 6.1% from 5.8% in the prior quarter and our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 10.27%.", "During the full year 2009, we raised nearly $1 billion of Tier 1 capital through various capital transactions. We announced tonight that we expect to amend our second and third quarter 10-Q\u2019s primarily to reflect the higher tangible common equity value described to the value of the conversion feature we added to approximately $1.2 billion subordinated debt back in June.", "We\u2019ll discuss this issue later in the call, but the reassessment of the accounting treatment is expected to result in approximately $173 million of additional tangible common equity in the June quarter and subsequent quarters roughly similar amounts, but should also resulted in modestly lower earnings in the future.", "Our core pretax, pre-credit cost earnings remained strong at about $940 million annualized in the fourth quarter. This excludes the non-cash amortization of discount on the subordinated debt. This is moderately lower than in the prior quarter due to the decline in loan balances and the newly issued senior notes, which occurred late in September.", "Our average demand deposit account balance growth remains strong rising an annualized 25% from the prior quarter. This is consistent with the trends that we\u2019ve experienced over the last several quarters rising about 30% since the year ago period. We believe this is partially attributable to low absolute interest rates and the FDIC guarantee on demand deposits.", "Nevertheless, we are encouraged that our demand deposit growth rate has significantly exceeded that of the industry. Importantly, our customer base has organically increased since the beginning of this credit cycle. The number of business customers increased about 18% since 2007.", "With that overview, I\u2019ll now ask our Chief Financial Officer and Vice Chairman, Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly performance. Doyle.", "Doyle Arnold", "Thanks, Harris and good afternoon or good evening, everyone. I\u2019m going to start with a discussion of the amendments to which Harris referred. If you\u2019re not aware, this afternoon in addition to filing our earnings release, we filed a separate 8-K as such that our second quarter and third quarter 2009, Forms 10-Q will be amended. We have not yet filed those amendments and will do so within the next week or two we believe, but we have incorporated the results of amending and restating second and third quarter earnings capital, etc., into this release and restated all prior periods.", "Let me explain, why and how this is being done. As some of you may be aware it\u2019s fairly common practice for the SEC from time-to-time to review and comment on the financial statements of a publicly traded company and shortly after the beginning of this year, in January, the SEC submitted to us a comment letter with questions regarding the accounting treatment of the subordinated debt exchange that we completed in June of 2009.", "As a result of these questions, we initiated a detailed review of that transaction with a specific view toward how to value, what is called the beneficial conversion feature. As you may recall, we added to the sub debt the right to convert to Series A or Series C preferred stock either option at the choosing of the holder and those options are called the beneficial conversion feature.", "Because of this review, we now believe that we should have accounted for the transaction differently than we did at the time and as Harris mentioned ultimately, this result in a significant increase in the equity of the company and while modestly reducing perspective earnings subsequently. Essentially a larger value attributed to that feature will result in larger amortization expense than previously indicated as we go forward.", "Without going too much depth in the prepared remarks, I\u2019ll try to describe the main thing that we think we did incorrectly and how it will be corrected. We originally assigned a value to this beneficial conversion feature based on the change in the subordinated debt prices prior to and after announcement of the transaction or the difference between $0.66 and $0.71 par.", "We now believe that it\u2019s more accurate to use the difference between the prices of the subordinated debt on the commitment date that\u2019s the accounting term, you may think of it as the closing date. It\u2019s essentially when we no longer have the right to modify or terminate the offer.", "Anyway, the price of the debt on that date and the price of the more valuable of the preferred shares on that date, which were our preferred C-shares, because that\u2019s in the money instrument that the note holders most likely would have elected to convert into. So to illustrate the sub notes we\u2019re trading at 71% of par on that date and the preferred C-shares we\u2019re trading at about $.99.", "This difference of 28% should have been the intrinsic value of the option and on $1.2 billion results in an after tax amount of $201 million, not the $45 million previously reported, and as I mentioned this amount is recorded as a discount on the subordinated debt and is amortized back to par over the life of the securities and therefore earnings in future periods will be a bit lower than under the prior accounting interpretation.", "Just to clarify a point, this is in addition to recording the debt at a discount due to the price differential between the market value of the sub debt and its par value, which was the difference between the $0.71 and par or about 29%. The current interpretation has been reviewed extensively by specialists within Ernst & Young and as we believe it to be accurate. However, the SEC has not yet had a chance to review our corrected accounting treatment.", "Now let\u2019s shift to the quarterly results. As noted in the release we posted a net loss applicable to common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $176.5 million or $1.26 per diluted common share. James has suggested that we try something different this time that I\u2019ll not walk you page by page through the highlights of the financials, but rather we group things into a few major themes.", "So I won\u2019t be doing that this time. If you don\u2019t like this, take it up with James and we\u2019ll regroup and do it a different way next time, but hopefully this will help us get through the call quickly. I\u2019m going to highlight three key areas, revenue, credit, and capital and then we will turn to your questions.", "First, the revenue drivers, the GAAP net interest margin, which you can find on Page 22 declined to 3.81% from 3.91% in the previous quarter, the adverse impact of subordinated debt amortization and total 28 basis points. In addition, the NIM was pressured by more than 30 basis points due to the level of non-accrual assets and interest reversals as loans moved into non-accrual status.", "Core NIM was just about flat perhaps down one or two basis points, primarily due to the issuance of senior notes in late September, which had about eight points of negative impact in the fourth quarter, a loss of swap income compared to the third quarter, about seven basis points and to a lesser degree the excess cash balances about two. Takeaway is that the underlying dynamics of the lending business is still producing higher spreads and we have also been active in reducing costs on interest bearing deposit accounts, which declined 27 basis points during the quarter to 94 basis points.", "The other key component of revenue is our earning asset base average loans declined $1 billion, due to weak loan demand as well as payoffs on construction loans. Construction loans declined by about $560 million, commercial business loan demand remains weak, although the balance did decline less than in the previous few quarters.", "Line usage rates for commercial loans have declined to about 39% from the recent peak of 44% in the September 2008 quarter. Again, although in the last three months of the year, usage appears to have leveled off. We did extend $1.7 billion of new credits or draws on previous lines during the quarter as evidence that we\u2019re actively lending, but charge-offs and pay downs etc. continue to work the total portfolio down and I think that\u2019s a common theme you\u2019ve heard throughout the industry so far this earnings reporting season.", "The core components of non-interest income can be found on Page 14, such as service charges on deposit accounts and other service charges remain fairly stable. However, the overall non-interest income remains volatile due to changes in items like fair value and non-hedge derivative income and OTTI. If you have questions on those items we\u2019ll address them in the Q-and-A or you can contact us after this call.", "Finally, the other temporary impairment of the CDO portfolio was significantly higher than we have previously expected and continues to prove difficult to forecast. In part, we had several bank failures very late in the quarter to which we had exposure as well as some deferrals late in the quarter and those drove the OTTI up, a little more than we had expected.", "I\u2019ll say overall, our estimate of fair value in OCI now appear to us to be a lot more stable and we have increased confidence in our valuation models. We note as we discussed in more detail on Page six of the text that most of the OTTI taken through income this quarter came from the original BBB and A rated bank CDOs and most of the OTTI had already been reflected in tangible equity through OCI.", "Moving to credit quality, as Harris mentioned we\u2019re encouraged by the lower level of net charge-offs. Gross charge-offs also declined, but somewhat more modestly. We provided a new chart on Page 21 to give you net charge-offs by loan type, something that many of you have asked for, so you can see the detailed quarterly same level of detail as we give you the other credit numbers there.", "We believe that a key take away from this page is that by examining the concentration of losses and non-accrual loans you can see the shift we\u2019ve been talking away from losses in high severity loans like commercial real estate, residential real estate, construction and development into loan types with lower loss severity rates.", "Construction loan losses accounted for just under half the total charge-offs, which is down from about 70% of the total a year ago. You can see that total commercial real estate charge-offs declined $52 million for the quarter and construction and land development were down by a much larger amount.", "Construction losses declined 36% sequentially and loss relative to non-accrual construction loans has improved significantly. We are still experiencing a relatively moderate increase on owner occupied loans, which account for 22% of total loans, 24% of non-accruals, but only 9% of quarterly net charge-offs. The loss rate is growing, in fact it was just under 1.25% annualized for the most recent quarter, but growing at a more modest pace than we saw in the previous quarter.", "Term commercial real estate loans, which account for 18% of total loans, experienced an increase in the loss rate similar to the prior quarter\u2019s rate. Net charge-offs from this portfolio were approximately 3.1% annualized. Note that a portion of the higher levels of loss from within this portfolio are due to credits in the gaming industry that were real estate collateralized and we had only a few exposures to that industry and we think there\u2019s stabilization occurring both within that industry and in the rest of our exposure.", "Within the C&I portfolio, which accounts for 25% of loans, net losses excluding the large recovery that Harris mentioned were only slightly higher than the prior quarter of a net charge off rate of about 3.0%. Relatively stabilizing rate of change in the last two quarters is we think is somewhat a light at the end of the tunnel. Finally, I\u2019ll note that the actual dollars lost to consumer charge-offs declined for the second straight quarter looking at this point like the peak may have been the June 2009 quarter.", "On the top of Page 21, non-accrual loans by type, I\u2019ll note that construction loans now account for 39% of non-accruals down from 51%, just two quarters ago. The largest increases in NALs came from the owner occupied portion of the portfolio, which accounts for two thirds of the link quarter increase in non-accruals.", "While there\u2019s some risk in this portfolio, I\u2019d note that the long history of loss content including the present within the portfolio and with the loss content in recent months running at only a fraction of C&I or construction. The next largest increase in non-accruals came from Amegy Bank, which also has had lower loss rates emerging thus far in the cycle.", "Restructured loans increased significantly for both accruing and non-accruing loans. The accruing, but restructured balance increased $91 million as loans have seasoned and equal about one half of 1% of loans excluding the FDIC guaranteed loans. We\u2019re tracking the performance of these restructured loans and in the future, we\u2019ll be able to provide you meaningful statistics on redefault rates, but so far those redefault rates are very low and we believe we\u2019ve been cautious on restructuring and subsequently allowing a loan to return to performing status, and there for we do not expect higher redefault rates in the future.", "Non-accrual, but restructured loans increased to $192 million and such loans account for 15% of non-accrual loan totals. The overall economic stabilization maybe contributing to some favorable trends within the non-accrual and OREO categories, you can look on Page 19, total non-performing loans actually declined slightly, OREO declined slightly, non-accruals were up slightly.", "Within non-accruals, we experienced total new NALs of about $860 million, similar to the prior quarter. However, we experienced about $310 million of favorable resolutions, which was up from about $255 million last quarter. Correspondingly, unfavorable resolutions dropped to just shy of $400 million from a number above $450 million in the prior quarter.", "A similar pattern is evident on other real estate owned. There was a similar in flow of about $150 million during the quarter, but favorable resolutions doubled to $130 million from about $63 million in the prior quarter. As I mentioned the OREO balance as you can see declined meaningfully.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to discuss the third topic, capital. As we\u2019ve already discussed due to the change in accounting treatment for the sub debt modification, we picked up a significant amount of common equity back in the second quarter and third quarter and flowing through to the fourth quarter of this year.", "Net of commissions, we also issued about $153 million of common stock during the quarter under our ongoing distribution program. In addition, we resulted in the exchange of $72 million of preferred shares for new common shares and both added to common equity during the quarter.", "We also experienced an improvement in other comprehensive equity of about $30 million in the quarter due to improvements in spreads in the debt markets. We were also successful in reducing end of period cash balances by $1.2 billion and the total balance sheet contracted by about $2.2 billion, compared to the last quarter and the smaller denominator, therefore, also helps improve the various capital ratios.", "Partially offsetting the effects of these items was the $176 million net loss for the quarter, but net-net, the result of these items was an increase intangible common equity, the 6.12% from a revised 5.76% in the third quarter. For those who don\u2019t remember the original reported amount was 5.43% third quarter and now we are at 6.12%.", "I\u2019d like to kind of summarize the guidance. A little bit of guidance for the next few quarters. It appears to us that there are no signs of loan demand at this point rebounding and therefore, we do expect loan balances to continue to decline and we also will try not to let our cash balances with the fed build as those earning assets decline.", "So the balance sheet may continue to shrink a bit for the next couple of quarters. We expect the core margin to be stable to improving in the next quarter as the cost of money market accounts at the end of the year remain high relative to benchmark indices. As a general statement, the balance sheet remains fairly asset sensitive.", "Turning to credit quality, everything we see says that the trend in gross and net charge-offs should continue to decline, probably be a bit uneven, but we think the trend is now downward and as Harris mentioned, we expect the reserve build to be very modest if any in the first quarter and in future quarters.", "We do think that the OTTI charges may remain more elevated for several quarters as previous bank failures have depleted the over collateral station of many of our original A and Triple BBB rated bank CDOs. However, we think the impact on tangible common equity will be relatively modest as we believe it\u2019s already been reflected in other comprehensive income through fair value marks.", "We do expect to issue some additional common shares to keep capital ratios reasonably stable until we return to profitability. Therefore, we do expect to announce one more common equity distribution program after the completion of the current one, which has about $27 million remaining in it.", "However, we expect the size of that program to be less than the $250 million that the previous ones have been. Beyond that, I\u2019d just note the regulatory and political and economic climate remain highly uncertain and difficult to forecast so, we\u2019re focused on just keeping the capital ratios reasonably in line for the next few quarters.", "With that, Anthony, would you open up the line for questions and I think we\u2019re ready for your questions at this point.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "First question I had was on non-performing loans and how we should think about the reserve build. I know you said basically reserve build is going to be very modest in first quarter, but if we continued to see the pace of increase in C&I and CRE non-performing loans. Is that baked into your guidance in any way? Would the reserve build change if the pace of increase in NPLs continues to go up?", "Harris Simmons", "The comment on reserve bill was predicated more on what we\u2019re seeing in our internal criticized and classified levels, which have flattened. We saw very little increase in the total graded credits as we called them special mention substandard and doubtful during the quarter.", "The trend had been beginning to level off the prior quarter, but it was really virtually flat and it\u2019s really those classification levels in combination with loss rates realized out of those levels that drives the reserves. The correlation to non-accruals is actually much looser so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the comment.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "My follow-up unrelated add definitely is in terms of the tough profile, it sounds like you\u2019re sort of backing away from the $50 million of OTTI per quarter and taking that up a little bit. Maybe did you have anything in mind like internally in terms of what you expect for OTTI losses and also if you can comment the difference between sort of the fair value and the carrying value so to speak? How should we be thinking about that change over time as you reduce your discount rates on the carrying value?", "Harris Simmons", "We struggled with what to say about the OTTI going forward, other than we\u2019re not sure, but we think the impact on capital is relatively modest. The $100 million was higher than we expected. I will note that so far this year, there have been nine bank failures we had exposure of one of the nine.", "We had ascribed 100% default probability at year end to that failure so far we\u2019re essentially un-impacted by bank failures this year. I don\u2019t know if the $50 million is right, it\u2019s going to be somewhat volatile I suspect and it could again be higher in some quarters, but I think the overall notion that there could be a couple $100 million more OTTI to come over the next few quarters is not out of line.", "Again, I think the capital impact from a tangible common equity perspective will be much more modest. I will note in response to the second part of your unrelated follow-up question, on page six of the press release, we have given you a little bit of additional info on the bank trust preferred, which is a portfolio which is I think $2.2 billion out of $2.7 billion of the total bank and insurance portfolio.", "We\u2019ve noted a couple things that 86% of the impairment charges came out of the original A and original BBB rated securities. We\u2019ve inserted the amortized cost values for all of the securities there in the middle of the chart and so, you can see the total OCI I guess, hasn\u2019t been reflected in income is the difference between 807 and 324 on the single A\u2019s and 40 and 15 on the BBBs and what we\u2019re suggesting is, we think most of the future impairments were going to come out of those two differences.", "There\u2019ll probably be some additional OCI taken along the way, but most of it we think is just going to be converting OCI and OTTI and will be some portion of that difference. I don\u2019t know if David, you have any other thoughts on that?", "David Hemingway", "The only other thoughts as far as we\u2019re concerned that, carrying value is the fair value under FASB 157, and they\u2019re synonymous; we\u2019ve recognized that there are trades in the marketplace, which are force trades, which are at different prices, but under the accounting guidance, the carrying value would be synonymous with the fair value.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan", "Doyle, putting all of your comments on guidance together, particularly on the reserve, what\u2019s your best guess as to when you\u2019re again profitable and is there any chance it\u2019s not a 2010 event?", "Doyle Arnold", "Best guess remains sometime in the second half of this year, and I guess is there a chance that it\u2019s not this year? Yes, I don\u2019t know how big a chance. I would actually guess that the OTTI volatility may be the swing factor in just when GAAP reported net income turns positive. The credit trends we think are reasonably foreseeable at this point, but that\u2019s the one that just from a reported bottom line may swing the difference between it being a third quarter event, a fourth quarter event or maybe a little after that.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan", "Just one follow-up, is the reported NIM going to be impacted by the restatement for the debt modification? I don\u2019t know if that runs for the NIM or not?", "Doyle Arnold", "Yes, it does and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to describe that in the text and it is reflected in the restated NIMs for the, well mostly third quarter because, the second quarter wasn\u2019t impacted much, but restated NIM does have the debt effect for the third quarter and then this announcement for the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hecht - JMP Securities.", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "First question is related to the restructured loans. I wonder if you can characterize the required conditions in order to engage in loan restructuring and maybe characterize the type of modification whether it\u2019s a rate or a maturity change at this point.", "David Hemingway", "Gerry Dent, our Chief Credit Officer is going to take that one.", "Gerry Dent", "The majority of our restructures is really relate to rate; however terms also play into the scenario and as far as placing them back on accrual goes we\u2019re really guided by the call reporting instructions from the regulators and by GAAP. In order to place a loan back on accrual we need to have evidence in our file that the borrower has the capability to continue to perform and then also they need to have performed for a period of at least six months if they\u2019re on a monthly amortizing basis and possibly longer if the amortizing basis is a quarterly or a semi annual payment.", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "Second question mixed related to your asset sensitivity. Can you just give us an updated sense for how many of your loans are through there? What percentage of your loans are through their floor, and what maybe 100 basis point change in short term rates would do to loans that are through the floor?", "Gerry Dent", "Our most recent guidance on that was published in a couple of IR Presentations that we did in the fourth quarter. We have not updated those, a significant portion of the new loans we do each quarter have floors on them that are in the money, it changed a lot since that picture. We\u2019ll update that chart for our hosted IR Conference coming up in about three weeks for those of you either attend or want to dial-in.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "First question was really, if you had any color on the loan balances by State, I was just curious if there\u2019s any kind of geographic concentrations where you\u2019re seeing more run off or subside maybe a little better demand at all?", "Doyle Arnold", "I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to be able to respond very well to that question, Joe. Anyhow, we\u2019ll look around near at what we\u2019ve got with us and maybe we\u2019ll come back if we can. We\u2019ll give you a second question since we couldn\u2019t do that one. It\u2019s like a call for a replay review. You didn\u2019t use up a time out.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "In the past you\u2019ve said the FDIC deal flow hasn\u2019t been that attractive. I was just curious, if you all actually did bid on any transactions in the past three months and, if you\u2019re current view on these kinds of transactions has changed at all?", "Doyle Arnold", "It really hasn\u2019t changed. I mean, the stuff that we\u2019ve seen from an asset standpoint is very undesirable in the markets, where we actually have management depth that we could take on just a lot of problem real estate and if you look back on Page 19, I think you\u2019ll see that our own for example, non-accrual loans have increased about a third since the end of June, about the last time we did those. So no, we haven\u2019t really been tempted to bid on anything.", "On a deposits only basis, it\u2019s really rather interesting. We\u2019re kind of a wash in deposits. We\u2019ve got lots of liquidity as we\u2019ve discussed previously, and we\u2019ve now done two deals where we paid no premium for the deposits. We served as a paying agent, where the expenses are covered by the FDIC and we\u2019ve booked, I mean we are opening deposit accounts in all of the Barnes Bank branches about as fast as we can open them. Again without incurring any conversion expense and that was our experience in Nevada as well.", "So we think, basically we\u2019re getting virtually all of the core deposits with no costs whatsoever doing it this way. So we\u2019ll probably stay based on what we\u2019re seeing and our own issues to deal with as we said we\u2019re going to continue to stay largely on the sidelines for the next quarter or two at least, but we may opportunistically do these paying agent deals or opportunities if they come along.", "Joe, I can answer maybe kind of generally your question about loan run-off in various subsidiaries. The largest run-off was in Nevada, but that\u2019s also market where we have the largest proportion of FDIC supported assets, which are running off at a higher rate as we generally work those off, but they\u2019re including those FDIC covered assets we were down annualized in the fourth quarter about 24%.", "So that was the most severe in Zions Bank, Utah and Idaho were down about 10% in California were down 11.5% there again including some FDIC, a lot of FDIC covered assets and excluding those, I\u2019m guessing it would have been closer to about 5% or 6%, something like that, Texas down 6.9%, Arizona down 10.2%, Colorado 4%. All those annualized.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Pancari - Macquarie.", "John Pancari - Macquarie", "Can you talk a little bit about the DTA? Can you just quantify it for this quarter and then just give us your updated view on the need for the allowance?", "Harris Simmons", "I\u2019ll give you two numbers. The GAAP net DTA, that\u2019s DTAs minus DTLs was $475 million at year end and that\u2019s down from a restated $582 million third quarter and restated $537 million second quarter. We did not take a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. On a regulatory basis, we basically start with the same number, but we did on a consolidated basis have disallowed DTA for regulatory capital purposes of $170 million and I don\u2019t have the breakdown yet by State for those.", "John Pancari - Macquarie", "How did that $170 million compared to last quarter?", "Harris Simmons", "Zero.", "Doyle Arnold", "Last quarter it was zero. I might add that $170 million was reflected in the estimated regulatory capital ratios that are on the very last page of the earnings release, page 24.", "John Pancari - Macquarie", "Then separately, do you have your dollar amount of TDRs in the quarter and the change in that amount?", "Doyle Arnold", "On the very bottom of page 19, you have restructured loans and non-accrual $298.8 million, restructured loans accruing $206.7 million.", "John Pancari - Macquarie", "Then last question is, can you talked a little bit about some of the credit pressure geographically. Can you talk about where you had to funnel capital down on the sub level? What subsidiaries got the most capital infusions?", "Doyle Arnold", "That will be available in the call report. Let\u2019s take another question and again we\u2019ll try to come up with an answer before the call is over on that one.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Hagerman - Collins Stuart.", "Todd Hagerman - Collins Stuart", "Doyle, just wondering, the comment that you made in terms as you were talking about kind of return to profitability if you will, you mentioned just kind of the visibility on credit. I\u2019m just curious kind of from a high level, as you look at the results this quarter, obviously a little bit better than I think what many people would have expected.", "I guess in general, if you talk about kind of the favorable versus unfavorable variances in the quarter, was there one or two things that kind of came in much better than expected as you guys kind of went through the credit process again this quarter and gives you more visibility in terms of the credit outlook?", "Doyle Arnold", "No, I mean I think if you go back to guidance earlier in the quarter that we gave and any commentary and IR conferences, we were saying that we thought that the provision number would probably start with a four, but in any event that would be down materially from the $565 million, I think last period. Of course the provision for loan losses was actually just under $400 million. The unfunded commitments in reserve increase brought it up to over $400 million.", "I think net charge-offs were probably a little better than we thought, even excluding the Flying J, if you look at the reconciliations on page 20, there were $61 million of total recoveries up from $7.8 million in the prior quarter and that\u2019s quite an increase even allowing $39 million for Flying J.", "So just in general, I guess the stabilization in criticized and classified the fact that within that stabilization, there were declines in Arizona, Nevada, in real estate construction some of the things that had been the major source of loss and the offsetting increases that got you the stability were in things like owner occupied real estate or commercial and some of the loans in Texas that seem to have lower loss content. So it\u2019s kind of those kinds of things that leads us to continue to guide to a general downward trend for both charge-offs and provisions.", "Todd Hagerman - Collins Stuart", "Then just maybe as a follow-up, could you just give a little bit more color in terms of you mentioned kind of the NPA inflow was relatively flat in the quarter, but I\u2019m a little curious in terms of kind of the favorable delta or variance specifically as it relates to the commercial real estate and the C&I bucket?", "Gerry Dent", "I don\u2019t know if we have a whole lot more detail on that one available to us right now, Todd.", "Harris Simmons", "We\u2019ll put a plug out for you Todd. We\u2019re actually going to show a little bit of that information at the Investor Day, so we\u2019ll hopefully see you there. Let me just cover off the previous question. The biggest slug of capital this quarter went into Nevada State Bank, about $100 million. We also put about $65 million into Texas and we did some other shuffling around converting Tier 2 to Tier 1 or what have you or preferred to common in smaller amounts, but those are the two net inflows or from parent down to subs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "With respect to I guess the increase in TDRs correlate somewhat with the improvement that we saw in 90 days past due, I was wondering if those two are correlated and then as a related question just maybe more color in terms of what you\u2019re actually restructuring of these commercial real estate loans and what kind of modifications you\u2019re doing?", "Gerry Dent", "The majority of the restructures are in the commercial loan arena although a few in the consumer, not very much, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s mainly in the commercial real estate area.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "Gerry, the other part of the question is there any correlation between the facts that the restructured loans increased quite a bit in the 90 days past due and accruing came down?", "Gerry Dent", "No, there will be some correlation there of course. I\u2019m not sure that we could quantify it, but obviously the loans that your best candidates so to speak for a TDR are those loans that are seriously delinquent.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "I guess as an unrelated question, you mentioned, you had the majority of the CDO trust preferred CDO hit this quarter was one you recognized in OCI of about $90 million somewhat, yet OCI only improved by $32 million, so I guess we already kind of refilling that unrealized loss bucket tied to those CDOs?", "Gerry Dent", "Yes, there were some new OCI taken in addition to the OCI that was related to the OTTI that had previously been taken. Yes, there is still some inflow into OCI. I mean, there was this quarter. James, we\u2019ve got a lot of questions left. We\u2019ve got about 10 minutes left and then if we try to hold it to an hour, how do you want to do this? Or let it run over a little?", "James Abbott", "We\u2019ll just go to one question and I\u2019ll call you back if we don\u2019t make it in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Just looking at the difference in the growth rates between the C&I non-accruals and net charge-offs. Basically with non-accruals up a lot and charge-offs down, and we know how timing can sometimes be skewed, but I\u2019m wondering; where is the average C&I non-accrual now marked relative to par?", "David Hemingway", "I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but I\u2019ll find out that most of the non-accrual increase is coming out of that owner occupied portfolio that has very little loss content in it. The loss rate as I mentioned, did tick up this quarter to about just less than 1.25%. We think there was a little bit of aberration in that, but there\u2019s the non-accrual pick up there does not have as much loss content as you might think.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "I was actually just referring to C&I within the commercial lending bucket and within that bucket, non-accruals were up and net charge-offs were down with the owner occupied and that bucket the losses did tick up.", "David Hemingway", "I don\u2019t think right here we have the\u2026", "Gerry Dent", "Where we don\u2019t have the average reserve balance against the C&I again I can\u2019t help you with that one.

I don\u2019t know if we have, do we have, I think, it\u2019s on page 19, fourth line from the bottom, accruing loans 30 to 89 days excluding the FDIC supported assets was down from $571 million to $428 million from quarter-over-quarter.

Does that help or does the disallowance just look at full year fiscal profitability?", "Harris Simmons", "It\u2019s actually for regulatory purposes it\u2019s a quarter-by-quarter calculation. It\u2019s not a full year. We do think that disallowed DTA for regulatory purposes will tick up again first quarter, when we\u2019re no longer allowed to look back to the remainder of the taxes paid in 2007 that we were not able to reclaim.", "The numbers probably going to go up to around $300 million, I believe is our estimate for regulatory DTA purposes and then we\u2019ll flatten out and begin to trend down from there as we can look forward four quarters and begin to pickup more quarters that have breakeven to profitable numbers in them.", "Erica Pannella - UBS", "How quickly can you recapture anything that\u2019s disallowed as you report profitable quarters?", "Harris Simmons", "Every quarter, I mean you eat into it every quarter that you report a profit at that point or can look ahead to a profitable quarter. So the rule for regulatory DTA, as you can look back to taxes paid if you can reclaim them, you can look backwards two years, and ahead four quarters, and that\u2019s every quarter you look ahead a new quarter. So if you\u2019re looking ahead to a profitable quarter you begin to eat into that disallowed DTA.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Patten - Morgan, Keegan.", ".", "Bob Patten - Morgan, Keegan", "Gerry, just a quick question on the loan sale market, what kind of activity, what kind of discounts you guys are seeing? How active where you in the fourth quarter and do you expect that activity to pickup?", "Gerry Dent", "As we\u2019ve stated in the past we really haven\u2019t been bulk sailing credits in large amounts, but primarily on a one off basis been selling loans and the total that we\u2019ve sold during the fourth quarter was $204 million, actually $205 million and they were sold at about $0.72 on the dollar.", "Bob Patten - Morgan, Keegan", "Jim, if I\u2019ve only got one question, I just want to ask Gerry about the restructured activity. Did the whitepaper or the CRE guidelines, did that help pickup an activity at all?", "Gerry Dent", "Pickup an activity as far as TDRs in the whitepaper they\u2019re referring to. Actually, it did have somewhat of an impact because it opened up a couple new avenues that we hadn\u2019t really been using previously, primarily the A note, B note situation, which helps us quite frankly to be able to restructure loans and put them in a position where although they become TDRs. We have the ability to in the future eliminate the TDR status and of course, that\u2019s for those that we\u2019ve structured into that method is down the road a little ways.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Marty Mosby - FTN Financial.", "Marty Mosby - FTN Financial", "A question on deposit growth, we had a lot of non-interest bearing deposit growth, but in total deposit growth we really saw a decline both period end-to-period end and also average-to-average. What\u2019s driving the loss in total deposits? Can you explain how you might see that going forward?", "Doyle Arnold", "As we\u2019ve mentioned before, we were selling $2 billion and at the peak nearly $3 billion a night to the Fed and it\u2019s basically a negative spread. So we have consciously runoff more expensive kinds of term CDs that we had put on and when liquidity was scarce aid year and a half ago, some broker deposits, cedars etc., so we have been consciously trying to shrink non-core interest bearing deposits and we\u2019re happy to have the non-interest bearing deposit growth. It\u2019s really as simple as that.", "Marty Mosby - FTN Financial", "What about pipeline for recoveries and I\u2019ll end with that, thanks.", "David Hemingway", "You mean loan recoveries?", "Marty Mosby - FTN Financial", "Yes, since we had the $61 million this quarter and $39 million of it related to one loan, how much do you think we might have going forward?", "David Hemingway", "I think we were positively surprised by the take out the $39 million, the other $25 million or $30 million, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a big pipeline yet that we\u2019re counting on for recoveries.", "Doyle Arnold", "I think it\u2019s too early in the cycle to really be able to say that.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Dave Rochester - FBR Capital Markets.", "Dave Rochester - FBR Capital Markets", "So regarding capital, you talked earlier about issuing an additional smaller ATM to keep the capital ratios fairly stable. Is this something that\u2019s been suggested that you do by the regulators, or is this something you just feel is prudent from a capital perspective as well as the holding company and liquidity perspective?", "Doyle Arnold", "Prudent, it\u2019s not been suggested. Some people probably listening into this call have suggested that we need to do $500 million to $1 billion, that would be more prudent and we\u2019re continuing to disagree with that point of view. We think we\u2019ll do a little more to make sure that we just don\u2019t want those ratios to get so low that people see a short selling opportunity or otherwise get nervous about us and that\u2019s as simple as that.", "Dave Rochester - FBR Capital Markets", "What\u2019s the liquidity position at this point at the holding company?", "Doyle Arnold", "I don\u2019t remember the exact number, but after repaying the $295 million maturing senior notes at year end, we ended up with around $550 million of cash at the parent and no major debt maturities now until June of 2012.", "All right, I think that\u2019s it, Anthony. Do you want to wrap it up, James?", "James Abbott", "Sure. Thank you, everyone for joining. I will be around for further questions or calls for those of you that were in the queue, I will go ahead and give you a call back. We appreciate you joining us today. We\u2019ll talk to you at our Investor Conference on February 10, 11 and 12. We look forward to having you here.", "Doyle Arnold", "Thank you all for your attention tonight.

(Operator Instructions)", "And now I\u2019d like to turn the program over to our speaker, Mr. James Abbott. Sir, please go ahead.", "James Abbott", "", "Thank you and good afternoon. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our first quarter 2010 earnings. ", "I would like to remind you during this call we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call. We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. If you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available as an Adobe Acrobat file at zionsbancorporation.com and can easily be downloaded and printed. ", "We will limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include the time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section we will ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one follow up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "With that, I will turn the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris?", "Harris Simmons", "", "Thanks very much, James, and to all of you for joining us and welcome to the call. The situation that we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter is continuing to underscore the fact that credit conditions in our franchise, and I think you see it generally across the industry, are improving. We are very pleased with the strong margin that we\u2019ve shown and the underlying strong core earnings picture. It came despite an awfully sluggish loan demand. We\u2019ve seen shrinkage as so many have. But the results this quarter have strengthened our view that we should return to profitability on a pretax basis later this year, and we are encouraged that the debt and the equity markets seem to be coming to a similar view.", "As we turn to our results, we reported a significant improvement in our quarterly results, although we reported a loss of $0.57 per share available to common shareholders in the first quarter. That\u2019s obviously a strong improvement compared to the net loss of $1.26 per share in the fourth quarter. Additionally as noted in the release there were two items related to capital and tax strategies that were unusual in nature and which netted to adversely impact earnings by about $0.17 per share.", "We also boosted the allowance for credit losses by a net of about 20 basis points on total loans which adversely impacted earnings by an additional $0.32 a share. Given the trends in losses and problem credits, we don\u2019t expect further material additions to the allowance in the near term. Doyle will speak more to that as we get into the detail.", "We\u2019re encouraged by the significant improvement in gross charge-offs, which were down 30% compared to the prior quarter, $248 million as compared to $356 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. In previous investor conference calls and presentations we have noted that the loss severity of substandard and non-accrual loans was likely to decline and indeed that forecast is playing out. Our allowance looks particularly strong when you compare our annualized first quarter net charge-offs, which had about 1.8 times coverage to our peer group, which is at about 1.1 times coverage.", "If you look at the total provision for both loan losses and unfunded commitments relative to net charge-offs, the excess provisioning peaked in the second quarter 2009 at 122% of net charge-offs, in terms of excess provision; 58% in the third quarter; 40% in the fourth quarter and 8% this quarter, so its been kind of trajectory that we have been suggesting was likely to occur for the last few quarters. Non-accrual loan growth continued to slow, rising 3% compared to the fourth quarter. As a result of the slowing as well as our frequent reviews of our largest problem credits, we believe the credit trends will continue to improve and that credit costs will continue to trend lower, although the rate of improvement we would expect would be more moderate than we saw in the first quarter.", "We\u2019re also very pleased with the continued improvement in both our GAAP and regulatory capital ratios, as well as for the strengthening of the allowance for credit loss ratio. We look back at what we have accomplished during the past year, our tangible common equity ratio has increased a full percentage point from 5.3% a year ago to 6.3% currently, despite absorbing $1.25 billion of net charge-offs, providing $780 million for loan losses in excess of net charge-offs. Taking roughly $465 million of securities impairments, including what has come through both OCI and OTTI, and $125 million of real estate owned expense. So to be able to build capital without viewing more dilutive damage than has [inaudible] so far, we think given what\u2019s happened in the last year has been an achievement.", "Initially the allowance for credit loss ratios improved by 2.3 percentage points during that period, and our Tier One capital plus reserves now equals 19% of total loans compared to a regional bank peer group average of about 16.5%. That places us in about the 75th percentile.", "We remain very pleased with the performance of our core deposit franchise, average DDA growth and our balances remain strong, rose an additional 13% from the prior quarter, partly attributable I\u2019m sure to the absolute level of interest rates, which remains very low, as well as the FDIC guarantees on these deposits. Nevertheless we are encouraged that our growth rate has significantly exceeded that of the industry and helped to produce a very strong margin performance this quarter.", "With that overview, I\u2019m going to ask Doyle to go through the detail of our performance. Doyle?", "Doyle Arnold", "", "Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, good evening everyone. As noted in the release and by Harris we posted a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $86.5 million or $0.57 a diluted share, which included a special tax item related to the cancellation of some BOLI policies as well as a modest gain on the exchange of subordinated debt for common stock that we did during the quarter.", "I\u2019m going to talk about three key areas this call, revenue, credit and capital, and then we\u2019ll turn it over for Q&A. First the revenue drivers. GAAP net interest margin expanded 22 basis points to 4.03% from 3.81 the prior quarter. The adverse impact of subordinated debt amortization on the modified sub-debt was 23 basis points this quarter, about 5 basis points less than in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the NIM is pressured by more than 30 basis points by our calculation due to the level of non-accrual assets and interest reversals, as well as move into non-accrual status.", "The primary driver of the NIM improvement was decline in both the rate paid and the balance of higher cost deposits, which accounted for about three-fifths of the NIM expansion. ", "The other key component of revenue is the earning asset base. The picture here isn\u2019t quite as bright. Period end loans declined $1.2 billion from end of year to end of first quarter. Average loans declined about $1 billion. We just continue to see very weak loan demand. The biggest piece of the decline was in construction loans, which declined by about $550 million, which was a roughly similar amount to the runoff in the prior quarter. And this does include owner and builder homes. We would expect that we\u2019ll continue to see runoff in construction as projects are completed and sell throughs continue while there is limited demand for new construction and development loans.", "C&I loan shrinkage drove about a third of the total portfolio contraction, although we had seen some tentative hints that C&I was stabilizing in the last couple of months of 2009. Line usage rates for commercial loans declined during the quarter from 39.3% to 37.8%, on average. We note that others have been experiencing similar declines at C&I lending. In fact, our results are, we think, somewhat better than we have seen nationally.", "The components of non-interest income and non-interest expense contained significantly less noise than in the fourth quarter. Fair value of non-hedged derivative income declined significantly to $2 million from $31 million in the fourth quarter. We would expect it to remain at a moderately positive level in the near term. This income is related to interest rate swaps, some pools of loans, floating rape pools swapped for received fixed. And over time the invented gain has declined such that when a loan matures or is renewed, the swap gain is relatively small at this point. These gains are already recognized in accumulated OCI and thus gains on the P&L are not impacting GAAP equity.", "On expenses, the primary thing to note is that salary expense declined during the quarter, although the amount of decline was masked a bit due to the seasonal expenses related to payroll taxes, which are always higher in the first quarter. ", "Provision for unfunded lending commitments was a negative $20.1 million. This is due essentially to shrinking unfunded loan commitments that are outstanding, particularly for construction loans, but also C&I as well as lower loss severity factors or reserve severity factors on these loan types. While we did release $20 million of reserves from the unfunded commitment reserve, we actually built the overall allowance for credit losses by $30 million, we over provided about $50 million in the A Triple F. ", "Also of note is that the other than temporary impairment of the CDOs was significantly better than the prior quarter\u2019s levels. This is due to two drivers. The vast majority of the banks that failed during the quarter had previously been modeled as of December 31 at a very high probability of default. In fact, going back to the prior quarter end, when we last computed OTTI, the average default probability assigned then to banks that failed in our pool this quarter was 89%. Also, the dollar amount of defaults for the quarter were about a tenth of the amount experienced in prior quarters, as mostly we are seeing much smaller bank failures now and we generally have had less exposure. In fact, year-to-date we have had exposure to 30% of bank failures nationally which compared to about 44% exposure rate in 2009. So far this year the bank failures have been smaller, we\u2019ve been exposed to fewer of them and our modeling has modeled those that did fail at a very high default probability which leads to lower OTTI.", "Now moving to loan credit quality, as Harris mentioned we are encouraged by the lower level of loan losses. The overall net charge-offs to loan ratio fell to 2.4% from 3% in the prior quarter. And on Page 15, which I won\u2019t go through here in detail, but you can see net charge-offs by loan type. ", "Construction and land development loan losses fell nearly 40% sequentially and accounted for less than 40% of total net charge-offs. That was down from about 60% of charge-offs six months ago. The annualized net charge-off rate for this particular loan category was about 6.5% in the first quarter compared to 9.6% fourth quarter, and a peak of 13.5% in the third quarter of last year. ", "As many of you know we track losses given classified status a bit more comprehensive than a loss given default ratio. For residential construction lending, that rate during the first quarter was roughly similar to the fourth quarter, although there were fewer loans in that category, leading to lower overall charge-offs. For commercial construction, the severity fell nearly 40% compared to the fourth quarter.", "Owner occupied loans account for 22% of total loans, 22% of non-accrual loans, but about 16% of quarterly charge-offs. The loss rate continues to increase at a modest but steady pace and may continue to rise in the near future. However, we are encouraged by the fact that we\u2019ve seen a flattening in the non-accrual ratio for this particular loan category.", "Term commercial real estate loans, which account for 19% of all loans, experienced a decline in the net charge-off ratio to approximately 1.25% compared to the prior two quarters and the 1.5 to 1.6% range, if you exclude two casino credits that had C&I characteristics as much as they had CRE characteristics. So we are not seeing at this point a rise in the charge-off ratio in term CRE lending.", "The C&I portfolio accounts for 24% of total loans. It experienced a net charge-off rate near 2%, down from a normalized rate near 3% in the prior quarter. And then finally consumer net charge-offs were stable compared to the prior quarter.", "Also note that there\u2019s non-accrual loan information on Page 15. We are encouraged by the continued slowing rate of increase for non-accrual loans, which rose only 5% sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter in which that has slowed. Owner occupied non-accrual loans declined about $14 million, a reversal from the previous trend. One quarter is no guarantee that we will continue to experience declines but it\u2019s encouraging that the upper trajectory did not continue in the first quarter.", "Term CRE loans increased $95 million, which was largely attributable SBA 504 loans or similar type loans which have lower loss content. Note that the net charge-off ratio on that portfolio declined to a 1.25% annualized rate, which is better than the industry\u2019s rate of 1.5% in the fourth quarter of \u201909.", "We\u2019ll now talk about migration trends, something that I know some of you are interested in within the non-accrual loan and OREO categories. Within non-accrual loans we experienced total, new non-accrual loans of about $600 million during the quarter, and that is down significantly from about $860 million in the prior quarter. We experienced about $270 million of favorable resolutions, which would include pay downs, payoffs and upgrades, compared to $310 million last quarter, so favorable resolutions down a bit. But unfavorable resolutions which include charge-offs and charge downs, OREO transfers, etc., dropped to approximately $267 million this quarter from nearly $400 million in the prior quarter. So fewer net new non-accruals and again an improving ratio of favorable resolutions to unfavorable resolutions.", "Although other real estate owned increased, it did so at a significantly slower rate than the prior quarter. It was up about 9% sequentially.", "We will briefly discuss capital. During the quarter we raised more than $200 million of common equity, both in the common equity distribution program and the exchange of sub-debt for common stock. As noted in the release, our tangible common equity ratio increased to 6.30% from 6.12% in the fourth quarter. Not included in the release, if cash had remained at a similar proportion to last quarter\u2019s loans, the TCE ratio would have improved to 6.5%. The higher concentration of cash is the primary reason that the regulatory ratios improved at a faster rate or more than the TCE ratio. Our Tier One ratio improved about 50 basis points from 11% to 10.5%. ", "Net of commissions we raised about $150 million of common stock during the quarter. That includes the close-out of a previous dribble program and issuance of about half of the currently authorized dribble program. We also exchanged about $55 million of subordinated debt for common stock. Both added to the common equity ratio.", "Summary of guidance for the next few quarters. Regarding the balance sheet, we expect loan balances to decline in the second quarter. Again, there is very little data to suggest otherwise at this point. We would expect NIM stability in the near term as pressure from excess cash balances will likely offset much of the effect from further rate declines in interest bearing deposits. Long-term, we remain well positioned for rising rates, as our cash to tangible asset ratio of 9% is approximately twice that of our peers.", "Organic loan production, including renewals, continues to be done at very accretive spreads, but cash is now a significant component of earning assets. Such assets have a negative spread. As a general statement, the balance sheet remains asset sensitive. We do continue to try to shrink the overall size of the balance sheet. We have identified about $1 billion of non-core funding that we believe we can reduce or eliminate in the second quarter, but we are also still experiencing very strong growth in DVA and other balances. And it is basically deposits that are driving the total size of our balance sheet at this point. So whether or not we can actually shrink the balance sheet or not or just sort of hold our own is something we really can\u2019t forecast at this point.", "Our trend to credit quality, we expect the trend in gross charge-offs and net charge-offs to continue to decline although at a more moderate pace than in the first quarter compared to the fourth. We would expect provisions to approximately match net charge-offs in the near term. Probably just a bit too early to start forecasting reserve releases.", "Securities portfolio, although our model was more accurate in predicting failures in the first quarter, we expect that we may continue to experience some OTTI charges for the next several quarters, as previous failures have depleted the over-collateralization of many of our regional A and Triple B rated bank CDOs. However, we believe that most of the impact on tangible common equity has already been reflected in other comprehensive income, through fair value marks, and indeed that was the case this quarter.", "Finally a comment on capital. As credit fundamentals continue to show improvement, and pretax profitability some time in the next couple of quarters looks a bit more certain, the need to raise equity just to maintain and incrementally grow our capital ratios is becoming a lesser issue. We\u2019ve begun to turn our thoughts toward the eventual goal of repaying TARP and what our normalized capital ratio should be in a post crisis, post TARP environment. We don\u2019t have any specific plans for imminent TARP repayment, but we are considering various strategies that would eventually facilitate such repayment including actions that would affect both the numerator and the denominator of our regulatory capital ratios.", "And whatever we do, the higher stock price we have today certainly makes any additional capital raises less diluted to earnings and to TCE per share than they would have been even just a few months ago. ", "With that, I think we will conclude our opening remarks and operator, if you would open the lines for questions please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets.", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets", "Could you just quickly talk about the driver of the reduction and the severities? I know you mentioned you didn\u2019t have the hotel credits you had to worry about, but is there anything else going on? Better pricing, anything like that? And then what kind of steps you\u2019re taking in terms of modifications that will help keep that solid in the future.", "Doyle Arnold", "If I could ask for a clarify \u2013 I didn\u2019t get the connection or maybe there wasn\u2019t one between pricing and severity. I\u2019m sorry. Did anybody else?", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets", "", "In terms of basically where you\u2019re marking these things. Where you\u2019re marking the collateral.", "Doyle Arnold", "For real estate?", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets", "", "Yes, for your charge-offs, for real estate credits whether its construction, CRE.", "Harris Simmons", "Let me offer an observation and that is as you, which I really believe applies across the industry, as you get further into this recession or this cycle you had a lot of charge downs. I mean since the end of 2008 we\u2019ve charged off and charged down $1.4 billion. And a lot of the loans which had been subject to charge downs are still on the books as classified loans, but I mean you\u2019ve kind of run the loss out of them. And so almost by definition as you get further into a cycle, you\u2019re going to see less severity as you\u2019ve taken some of those early hits, particularly given the fact that a lot of these markets are in fact stabilizing. You\u2019ve seen some stabilization in both residential and commercial values. And so the combination of what we\u2019ve done here for and what the markets are doing is a lot of that. ", "I think in terms of where we have them marked, we continue to get new appraisals as the loan remains classified. We update those appraisals every 90 to 120 days. I mean they\u2019re frequently updated. And we mark them at a discount to the appraisals. So all of that is starting to bear fruit.", "James Abbott", "David, this is James. One thing I might chime in is we\u2019ve heard a little bit anecdotally recently of some of the other participants on the buy side, property REITs, etc., coming in to buy properties and we\u2019re hearing that cap rates are falling a little bit as a result of that cash sitting in the marketplace as we talk to the lending officers.", "David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets", "", "I would imagine the parent company at liquidity is in a better position now even than it was last quarter. Can you update us on that and then talk about how much capital you actually had to push down into sales this quarter?", "Harris Simmons", "Yes. Total parent cash was $600 million and change at quarter end, and I believe that\u2019s similar to or up a bit from year end. So I would agree with your statement. We\u2019ve basically pushed about $100 million down to M&G Bank this quarter and currently don\u2019t anticipate pushing much if any capital to the banks from here on out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "First question, and I just wanted to see if you could clarify your comments a little bit around these higher cash balances. I\u2019m just wondering, have you started to deploy some of this excess cash into higher yielding assets just yet in the second quarter or should we think about higher cash for longer? Potentially is this cash set aside for TARP repayment? And will that also continue to benefit your capital ratios?", "Harris Simmons", " ", "Well, the answer is no, we\u2019ve not deployed it into any higher yielding assets. We are very loathe to buy longer day of securities given the prospect of rising interest rates. So what we\u2019re basically trying to do is continue to run off higher costs of deposits to keep that excess cash balance from building as opposed to trying to deploy it in any particular way. We continue to revisit that. At this stage, most of that cash, I mean there\u2019s $600 million of it that is at the parent. The other $3 billion or so is at the bank level and would not immediately be available to repay TARP. That\u2019s not kind of the way we\u2019re thinking of it at this point.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "", "Just a follow up question on the commercial real estate portfolio. Your charge-offs has really improved a lot here, you know, both in the term portfolio and in the construction portfolio. And when you think about the drivers here, maybe you could identify some of them. Is this new run rate sustainable? And you did say term you expect to get better from here, but construction? I\u2019m guessing you also expect to see improvement there. And do you also think restructuring activity has been one of the drivers? And we don\u2019t actually have the mix of restructuring in the commercial real estate, but if you have that number, that would be pretty helpful.", "Harris Simmons", "Well, first of all thank you for noticing that the severity did decline. Second, you cheated. That was one question and four follow ups, and we weren\u2019t taking notes. I mean I guess his underlying question is do we think the general trend and severity of construction is sustainable and whether or not we see indication that term severities going to uptick. Is that a fair?", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "", "That\u2019s fair.", "Doyle Arnold", " ", "Well, I think as we said during the early part of the call, I think we would expect to continue to see improvement as we go along but not at the same pace as we saw in the first quarter. And I think that was a significant improvement from the fourth quarter. We think it probably gets better from here. It looks to me, personally, as though we\u2019re getting some kind of positive feedback where it\u2019s going in the economy, consumers are starting to spend, etc., etc., and that that will help over time. And that\u2019s how these cycles run. And that that will lead to continuing improvements in severity, but it may not be totally linear. I think we\u2019ve seen the worst of it.", "Harris Simmons", "And I\u2019d say, to repeat something we\u2019ve said before was that by far our biggest severity issues were with land and development loans in Arizona and Nevada, and those are now charged down or paid down to such a relatively low level of total balances that the continuing charge-offs coming out of there will be much more modest. And the charge-offs coming out of even the same categories in other geographies are just not as severe as they were in those markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "It seems that most of the prepared comments focused on profitability on a pretax basis. I just wanted to confirm, are you guiding to expect profitability later in the year inclusive of the TARP dividend?", "Doyle Arnold", "You\u2019re getting us back into earnings guidance, aren\u2019t you?", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "", "Well, I just want to make sure there\u2019s not a difference between after tax expectations and pretax expectations.", "Harris Simmons", "I don\u2019t want to refine that to that degree. The preferred dividends are running about $25 million, and I think we wouldn\u2019t slice it that thin yet.", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "", "I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t get that, Harris. ", "Harris Simmons", "I\u2019m just saying I think that we\u2019re reasonably comfortable in saying that we probably think that pretax we\u2019re probably going to get to profitable. I don\u2019t know if we really have developed a view on how the dividend affects it. I would hope to get there, but I don\u2019t know.", "Doyle Arnold", "I think it\u2019s fair to say, Steve, that even we are a bit pleasantly surprised by this quarter turning out a bit better than we would have expected, even a month or two ago. And trying to figure out what and we are confident that the fundamental trends that drove that are real, but exactly when the lines cross and how strongly they cross, we\u2019re not yet.", "Harris Simmons", "I mean, among other things for example, and I know we talked a lot about these CDOs and depending on which banks fail, etc., that could affect earnings, though not capital, very severely. And that could make all the difference in the answer to the question that you\u2019re asking. ", "Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan", "", "Given the drop we saw in the severity of losses on the C&D, how much loss content do you think is roughly left on that $5 billion book? I mean, is it $500 million? You\u2019re at $86 million in charge-offs this quarter. Just wondering how much is left there.", "Doyle Arnold", " ", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to try to forecast that yet.", "Harris Simmons", " ", "The annualized net charge-off rate in the quarter was about 6.2%, I think, 6.5% and that\u2019s going to remain elevated here for another two or three quarters. But the size of the portfolio is certainly coming down, but there\u2019s still problems in there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "I guess from your comments it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re seeing core improvement, but is there any kind of gauging you can give us of seasonality this quarter? You know historically we\u2019ve seen lower charge-offs in the first quarter versus the fourth. You know, especially in the construction book how much of it is seasonal improvement? And is that factoring into kind of some of your comments around the second quarter also being better, but maybe not better as quickly as the first?", "Harris Simmons", "I don\u2019t think we would agree that there was any seasonality to those numbers to speak of. I think it\u2019s all driven by the economy and fundamentals. And no, I mean I think our first versus second quarter guidance is maybe just a note of caution. We\u2019ve had a pretty steep decline in gross charge-offs from $392 to $350 to, you know, it\u2019s just been coming down pretty precipitously. Until the economy really starts to generate jobs and so forth, it\u2019s hard for us to believe that that pace of decline can continue. We\u2019re confident that the trends are stable to improving, but that pace, particularly first quarter compared to fourth strikes us as unsustainable. We\u2019d have zero charge-offs in two more quarters if it did.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "", "And if I could ask one follow up on loan pricing. At your analyst day you had a helpful Slide showing that spreads on new loan originations month by month for the past two years or so. How does that look now, I guess, if we updated that chart for March?", "Harris Simmons", "I haven\u2019t actually seen the March numbers yet but it was pretty stable through February. Anecdotally we\u2019re hearing about a little more price competition out there, because everybody has got the same issue that we have, to a more less degree. That issue being lots of liquidity and very limited loan demands, so everybody\u2019s chasing the good customers now.", "Our overall spread, that chart would be relatively flattish through at least most of the quarter compared to what you saw.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Doyle, you made a comment about TARP repayment saying that you wanted to do something or you would consider doing something that affected both the numerator and denominator. Numerator I get, but in terms of the denominator, can you elaborate on that comment?", "Doyle Arnold", "Not now. Stay tuned. I mean it\u2019s one of those things. There\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat is all and for those who are trying to project, you know, $1 billion of capital raises to repay TARP, be careful as a ratio has two numbers in it and we\u2019re going to work on both. And I\u2019ve said this before, it\u2019s too early to say for sure but some of the strategies that we\u2019ve been working on, whether or not they will come to fruition, but nothing that we\u2019ve been working on has fallen off the wagon yet. And we\u2019re growing increasingly confident that we might be able to take a whack at some things. The only thing I\u2019ll say is we\u2019re trying to address risk weightings of certain assets, not the fact that we have certain assets on our books. That\u2019s the only hint I\u2019ll give you.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "", "Just in terms of broader capital position, obviously the Tier One comment and TCE over the last several quarters, you mentioned that the equity issuance that you\u2019re doing is becoming lesser of an issue I think your words were. Are you guys targeting any informal capital levels? You know, what\u2019s driving you to increase it say, 20 basis points versus 40 basis points in any given quarter?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, I wish we could hit the bullseye as accurately as you maybe try and give us credit for there, but our general thought is that we didn\u2019t want to see them drop. We wanted to see them increase. If you look at our risk based capital ratio particular compared to a number of banks that have repaid TARP, ours are still light by some measures against some of those people. So we think there\u2019s probably some additional capital build that needs to occur. But quite frankly I don\u2019t know what and when yet. There\u2019s no particular number that I can give you, in part because the regulators to my knowledge have not given anybody a particular ratio or target that is the magic bullseye.", "Doyle Arnold", "I think it\u2019s also really affected by again, what happens with transient charge-offs. We\u2019ve indicated we think we\u2019re probably reasonably close, at least to the peak in terms of the coverage we\u2019re likely to need in reserves. The other question is, what happens to the absolute levels of charge-offs as they come down and that starts actually to replenish capital? That\u2019s going to help because like I say over the course of the last year, January 1 of 2009 we\u2019ve built our reserves by $940 million. If you don\u2019t have that kind of drag and you see charge-offs coming down, then the picture really could change a lot. And particularly in an environment where you have reasonably weak loan demand. ", "Harris Simmons", "I don\u2019t want anybody on the call to sort of get ahead of us here. I think it\u2019s a fair observation that most of the banks that have repaid TARP have either lower problem credit ratios than Zions and/or declining ones, and they also have either been profitable or within striking distance of being profitable. While we\u2019re very encouraged by what happened this quarter, its probably going to take another quarter or two of moving toward striking distance of profitable and seeing the credit metrics, particularly classifieds and non-accruals, things like that, not just stabilize but begin to actually come down before we\u2019ll have a clearer picture. And that may be a quarter or two away, and maybe second half of this year is probably when we get more serious about what does it take to repay TARP.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Jennifer Demba - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Two questions. One, with loan demand being as weak as it is, where do you see the loan portfolio troughing? And two, Doyle you typically give us some more color about what\u2019s going on credit quality wise and economically in the various markets. Can you give us an idea there?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, I\u2019ll take the second one first. We\u2019ve probably seen a, I guess in almost all geographies and loan types we\u2019ve seen a meaningful decline in special mention loans and in earlier stage delinquencies. We have seen a flattening or decline in classified loans and non-accrual loans and a lot of markets, but probably the most notable exception would be in Zions Bank where classified loans continue to trend upward. A lot of that is being driven again out of the owner occupied real estate portfolio and we continue to see significant increase in non-accruals although not graded or classified in substandard, special mention loans in [amage]. We saw probably if you look at non-accruals, which were more or less flattish for the quarter, up a little bit, if you kind of go around the geographies the biggest increase by some margin was at amage, the biggest decline was in Arizona and all of the other banks were ups and downs a little bit.", "But the general plateauing or improvement was fairly widespread. I guess in terms of geography in terms of categories, the improvement in construction of both types was pretty widespread. Where we\u2019ve seen some continued deterioration, increasing classifieds, etc. at a modest rate is in term CRE and in C&I. That\u2019s a broad characterization.", "Harris Simmons", "I\u2019d just add to that. I think with respect to amage, though we had an increase in non-accruals they also probably, as we go through deals and look at what\u2019s on the calendar for resolution in the second quarter that probably looks like where we\u2019re going to see probably the biggest pace of problem resolution. And we\u2019ve seen actually some good reduction in sort of the special mention categories, sort of the front end of the pipeline, and we have a lot of things being resolved at amage, so as not to read too much into that [situation].", "Unidentified Executive", "As for where does loan demand bottom, that\u2019s really hard to forecast at this point. We all have our gut feels about it. If the economy continues to recover, let me just say I\u2019d be very surprised to see this rate of runoff that we\u2019ve had in the last couple of quarters continue for more than another quarter or so. I think it\u2019s tough to believe that by mid-year we\u2019ll start to see that attenuate, but that is just my gut feel. I can\u2019t point to much evidence to support that right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Erika Penala \u2013 UBS.", "Erika Penala \u2013 UBS", "", "My first question has to do with the OTTI run rate on the [tropic] portfolio. So I guess if the bank failure rate in both number and size accelerates later in the year, do we expect the OTTI to increase from this quarter\u2019s run rate? Or has that acceleration already been recaptured in the dividend deferment part of your model?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, our model has embedded in it an expectation of the number of failures that we will experience not only this year but for the remaining life of the securities. We\u2019ve got one year, two year, five year and LIFO, life of the security default probabilities modeled in. I\u2019m trying to think, David, do we have a? I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve got. I haven\u2019t tried to mentally adjust for kind of what\u2019s the rate first quarter, but we had built into our OTTI last quarter and this a significantly higher rate of failures than occurred last year. Now I haven\u2019t tried to extrapolate from first quarter. Well, there\u2019s 50 year-to-date nationwide of which we had exposure to 15. So that would imply almost 200 for the year. Is that right? ", "I think that\u2019s roughly where we\u2019re modeled.", "Unidentified Executive", "", "If it increases, it will have an effect on OTTI. It\u2019s just that it will be less severe in terms of impact on capital, because probabilistically we do have a lot of that modeled into our GAAP capital. ", "Doyle Arnold", "It affects regulatory but not GAAP as much. I\u2019m sorry. If you want to go, one of the things if you haven\u2019t seen it, Erika, I believe we\u2019ve disclosed some stress testing scenarios of that portfolio to give you. You can sort of pick your own poison as to how much more severe default probabilities get and deferral, lack of recoveries get, and we show you. And if you look at our presentation at the Citi conference about a month ago.", "Unidentified Executive", "", "Erika, just looking at Slide 25 from the Citigroup presentation, it would be a run rate of about 220 bank failures this year. That assumes a 45% exposure ratio and our exposure ratio as we mentioned on the call earlier is about 30%. So it would be a closer number to maybe 300, perhaps 275 would be the annual number that our OTTI implies right now.", "Unidentified Executive", "", "Or what\u2019s more important than the number of banks is the amount of exposure that we have to them, and what probability of default that we\u2019ve already taken the loss. And as they continue to close, smaller banks, it\u2019s important to remember we have less exposures as a percentage to smaller banks. And if we do have exposure, the amount of exposure tends to be a smaller amount which will lead to lower OTTI.", "Doyle Arnold", "I guess final comment would be, if there\u2019s a large bank out there that we have somehow missed and modeled at a low default probability, that would have an impact. But the last time that occurred was UCBH which committed accounting fraud by allegation at least, and that\u2019s hard for us to work around. But short of somebody else out there doing that, we think the modeling is increasingly honing in on reality here for us. Sorry, that\u2019s probably too long an answer.", "Erika Penala \u2013 UBS", "", "My follow up question was on strategies for TARP repayment. I hear you loud and clear that it\u2019s not necessarily something that you\u2019re looking to do over the next few quarters, but have you actually had in depth conversations with your regulators in terms of I guess different past inning strategies? Because it seems like the folks that have already gone and paid haven\u2019t necessarily gotten full credit for asset disposals or denominator reworking.", "Harris Simmons", "I think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019ve had discussions. Whether I\u2019d characterize them as in depth, I don\u2019t know. I would characterize them as certainly unclear at this point, and including all the points you\u2019ve raised. How much credit do we get for the well over $1 billion of capital we\u2019ve already raised, whether or not we get credit for denominator reduction, how much? But there does come a point when the ratios, if they\u2019re built strong enough, they sort of speak for themselves. We have not engaged, and it\u2019s premature to really totally engage on that point, so I just can\u2019t. But we\u2019ve started having discussions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hecht - JMP Securities.", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "Doyle, you did touch a little bit on the classified assets in various parts of the discussion, but I guess just to summarize the classified asset trends, is it fair to say that migration trends in classified assets was similar to the migration trends in the non-accrual category?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, yes, I think it probably is fair to say. What I don\u2019t know is how it compared to last quarter, but you know overall classified assets were up only about 2% and that\u2019s by far the smallest increase that we\u2019ve had. We\u2019ve just had pretty good upgrade and payoff activity compared to, and certainly charge-offs were a lot lower this quarter. So while I haven\u2019t really tried to tie that all out, I don\u2019t know of any reason to think that the pattern isn\u2019t similar to the non-accrual.", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "", "And then a follow up question. Harris, both you and Doyle talked about that you would probably keep a provision level that mirrored your charge-off levels for the foreseeable future. The question is, what would set the stage for you guys to be able to begin to pull back on your allowance level? And what level, if you look through the cycles, is a good level to think where it would normalize out to as you pull it back?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, first of all there\u2019s a methodology in place that you must cue to. And so there\u2019s a limited amount of discretion that you have around sort of the qualitative adjustments you make to a quantitative approach to this. I think the reason that we have said what we\u2019ve said is because the loss severity is decreasing, the loss factors as we look back over time, you know, we think we\u2019ve seen the peak of those loss factors in classified, criticized, problem assets are also reasonably stable. And so that would lead one to believe that probably the pressure on the reserve starts to come down. And I do think that going forward probably most outside the industry and most inside the industry are interested in not running reserves way down. We really need to get, I think, from the loss incurred to more of a forward-looking approach to reserving. And I think regulators are reasonably intent on that. And so there are question marks, I think, around how this will play out and what kind of guidance the industry will see from regulators. But I think we would hope that we will all see methodologies employed that will not introduce the kind of cyclicality to this process that became so ruinous during this cycle.", "James Abbott", "We have time for maybe a couple more questions and maybe just one question each. And then we\u2019re going to have to cut it off. But I will get back to anyone who is on the line who doesn\u2019t get addressed afterwards.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kenneth Usdin - BofA Merrill Lynch.", "Kenneth Usdin - BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "My question is really to net interest margin. Doyle, I think I got your context that kind of pluses or minuses pretty much wash out near term with a couple of the moving parts. But I was wondering if you can just kind of give us some thoughts around future direction of the margin and how much lift do you think you can get in the margin once rates actually do go up? Maybe in the context of where it needs to sit, at the last peak was $470 or so. I don\u2019t know if you think that\u2019s attainable, but any comments you could help us understand that magnitude and potential would be appreciated.", "Doyle Arnold", "Hi Ken. Good question. Well, there\u2019s a couple of things. One is, if rates tighten, yes we do think we have margin expansion. A second comment would be a rate tightening scenario is probably also consistent with a non-accruals coming down scenario, which also helps the margin. In other words, the Fed is not likely to tighten unless there\u2019s real strength in the economy which would imply low credit quality continues to improve. So I have not tried to quantify it, but I think you get lift from both of those things. In our present capital structure I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide whether you want to model and if so how you want to model. ", "The third thing that could happen in that scenario which is that current holders of sub-debt can be exchanged for preferred might choose to do that, and as we\u2019ve discussed many, many times if and as that happens that\u2019s a one time hit to the margin at the time it happens. But the fundamental margin probably has many tens of basis points of potential lift in it and the scenario you were describing.", "Kenneth Usdin - BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "One little clarification. The 23 basis points of drag from the sub-debt now, does that run rate from here or does that alleviator get worse from here? Can you just describe that? The 13 and the 10 that were in this quarter\u2019s numbers?", "Doyle Arnold", "", "Ken, it will probably accelerate somewhat. The accelerated amortization will be relatively volatile. That\u2019s what we can\u2019t predict. And in the second quarter there are two issues that can convert, so that actually exacerbates it in the second quarter or in the fourth quarters as well. In the other, what we call normal amortization that actually can accelerate or increase a little bit over time because it\u2019s done on the effective yield method. And I can go over that with you offline, but it\u2019ll slowly creep up over time because of that methodology.", "Kenneth Usdin - BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "So directionally they both could creep up in terms of basis points impact in the second?", "Doyle Arnold", "That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays Capital", "", "Looking at the loan numbers, it looked like I think construction came down about $500 million but term went up about $300 million in the quarter. Were there any kind of I guess financing some of the construction products were overturned, given they don\u2019t have access to the permanent market and maybe just talk about that. And then secondly, unrelated but your security deals went up like 50 bits lean quarter and your healthy maturities are up over 200 bits. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on there as well as any impact from purchase accounting adjustments tied to prior acquisitions?", "Doyle Arnold", "I\u2019ll address the second question real quick. The security deal we had a contra interest expense last quarter that pushed the, you\u2019ll notice it most in the P&L. You\u2019ll see that there was a negative interest income line item last quarter. That was a true up of about $4.5 million. That went away and so we\u2019re kind of back to a normal. So it was the fourth quarter that was the aberration not first quarter. And Jerry, do you want to talk about the other?", "Unidentified Executive", "", "The increase in the term commercial real estate loans is only partially a result of the decrease in the construction loans. We do have some construction loans that are moving to term loan because the properties are leasing up and they are qualifying. We have fairly strict standards for moving a loan from construction to term. They basically need to qualify as though they were being originally underwritten as a term loan before we move them into that category.", "Doyle Arnold", " ", "And just Jason, in general some people have asked what does that mean? And it\u2019s generally a 1.25 debt service coverage and a very solid loan to value ratio.", "James Abbott", "Okay. Thanks everyone. That will do it for today\u2019s Q&A session and there are a handful of people, we\u2019ve taken down your names and so I will give you a call back as soon as I can tonight.

Sir, please go ahead.", "James Abbott", "Good evening and thank you. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our second quarter 2010 earnings.", "I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to the statements made in this call.

Harris?", "Harris Simmons", "Thanks very much, James, and welcome all of you. This quarter is one in which we have continued to see some progress generally in credit quality trends, but it remains somewhat choppy in terms of the economy and the outlook for the economy in the near term.", "We're seeing decidedly improved trends in some of our markets, Utah, Texas, perhaps most notably, but contain challenges in some of the southwestern markets, Nevada most especially, and California, Arizona as well.", "We view the quarter as one in which we made reasonably good progress on credit quality and we believe our visibility continues to improve in that area. We were able to reduce non-accrual loans for the first time since the financial crisis began, and we believe that the improvement will continue into the third quarter, as other measures of problem credits also declined at encouraging rates during the quarter.", "This quarter wasn't without its challenges, as loan balances continued to decline at a strong rate. Though the largest portion of that decrease came in construction and land development elements of the portfolio where we are actually encouraged to see them coming down and reducing our exposure in those areas.", "We are encouraged with a significant increase in gross loan originations and renewables compared to the first quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset paydowns, and to a smaller extent charge-offs, and we expect that net loan growth is going to remain a challenge in the near term, and particularly as a result as we've indicated before, the continued shrinkage in the construction and development portfolio.", "Turning to our results, there were several noisy items that obscure some positive trends which we'll review on this call. We reported a loss of $0.84 per share to common shareholders in the second quarter. Net income before taxes fell to a loss of a $136 million, which was down $44 million from the first quarter. This decline can be primarily attributed to the conversion of subordinated debt into preferred stock, which was a $49 million increase in expense from the second quarter compared to the prior quarter.", "As we said in the prior quarter's call, we didn't expect to add significantly to the allowance for credit losses and during the quarter we note that the ratio, the allowance for credit losses to total loans only increased 6 basis points compared to a 24 basis point increase last quarter, an increase of more than 200 basis points in 2009.", "As you are aware, we raised about $600 million of capital during the quarter, which is responsible for a significant improvement in our GAAP and regulatory capital ratios. Looking back at what has been accomplished during the past several quarters, the tangible common equity ratio increased 160 basis points from March 31, 2009 through the end of the second quarter of this year despite absorbing $1.5 billion of that charge-offs, $339 million of securities impairments, including both OCI and OTTI, $168 million of other real estate owned expense and enhancing the allowance for credit losses ratio by 200 basis points or the equivalent of $850 million.", "With these actions, our capital ratios have moved above the peer median. We remain pleased with the performance of our core deposit franchise, which we continue to believe is among the best in the industry. Average noninterest bearing demand deposit balance growth remained very strong, rising an annualized 25% from the prior quarter. It is up 25% compared to the year-ago level.", "We believe this is partially attributable to low absolute interest rates and the FDIC guarantee on demand deposits. Nevertheless, we are encouraged that our demand deposit growth rate has significantly exceeded that of the industry.", "With that general overview, I'll ask Doyle Arnold, our Chief Financial Officer and Vice Chairman to review the quarterly performance in more detail. Doyle?", "Doyle Arnold", "Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. As noted in the release, we posted a net loss applicable to common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $135.2 million or $0.84 loss per diluted common share.", "I'll highlight three main areas that drove that result. Revenue, credit quality and cost, and capital, and then we\u2019ll turn to your questions. First revenue drivers; the reported GAAP net interest margin compressed 45 basis points to 3.58% from 4.03% the prior quarter. The core NIM, which excludes amortization of sub-debt and items related to FDIC loan outperformance fell 12 basis points to 4.14% from 4.26% due primarily to the increase in average cash balances on our balance sheet.", "So there was an incredibly wide range of estimates for the NIM as we look at some of your reports. The low we found was 3.51 and the high was 4.10. We published the impact of the sub-debt amortization in May in an 8-K and we do that every quarter, and I said both publicly and in a number of one-on-ones that all else being equal you should expect a NIM of 3.5% to 3.6% this quarter on a reported basis.", "And on a core basis, comfortably above 4% still. Just the difference being \u2013 so I would really encourage you all to watch for our next 8-K, which will be in September in which time we will announce the amount of sub-debt that has converted into preferred and what the impact of that will be on the NIM.", "We try to be as clear as we possibly can and it does appear that some of you have missed that or publishing numbers that are on a core basis and what have you. So I guess the bottom line from our perspective and, but for the growth and cash balances on the balance sheet, the NIM was fairly stable on a core run rate basis as we suggested I think last quarter that it would be.", "We also \u2013 we did have couple of offsetting movements. We moved more than $1.1 billion of higher rate money market accounts out of the bank, and attempting to manage down cash. But as you will note on the balance sheet disclosures we have strong inflows of nearly $1.3 billion in DDA, and this combined with loan runoff of nearly $1 billion basically prevented us from achieving a reduction in cash balances instead they grew \u2013 I would note prevented us from shrinking the balance sheet further this quarter, it also grew slightly with a negative impact on tangible common equity ratio, not so much on regulatory risk-based measures but on that.", "Yield on loans, excluding the effect of a writeup on FDIC loans due to favorable performance was stable at about 5.59%, but the yield on incremental loan production and renewals during the quarter was about 5.2%, somewhat lower than the average and I will talk a little bit more about that in a moment.", "As a reminder for those who are contemplating potential levels of our long-term net interest margin, depending on how you want to calculate it, it is pressured by more than 30 basis points due to the level of nonaccrual assets and interest reversals as loans moves into non-accrual status.", "Other key component of revenues, the earning asset base. As I mentioned, period end loans declined $977 million, or 2.5% from March 31 and average loans declined about $1.1 billion primarily due to continued soft loan demands although as Harris indicated we saw a little bit of a pickup in new originations, first time draws on lines, etcetera. Excluding construction, FDIC insured loans, end of period loans declined 1.1% sequentially. So I think those numbers as a percentage declines are roughly in line with what I\u2019ve seen so far at least around the industry and probably don\u2019t come as a big surprise to you.", "What we have seen in the last couple of months is a fairly significant increase in price competition for better quality, larger commercial loans and perhaps more modest increase in competition for more typical smaller business funds.", "We\u2019ve been cautious in meeting those pricing in terms which probably has affected loan balances, but seems pretty clear that this price competition is real and that we have, as you can tell by the marginal pricing of new loans, begun to meet it in some instances and we will expect that we may have to continue to selectively meet that price competition again on larger, better quality commercial credits.", "The primary component of the loan attrition was construction loans, as it has been for a number of quarters now, which declined about $600 million and accounted for more than 60% of the total attrition in the quarter, and we do expect that that category will continue to decline due to charge-offs, completion of projects and little demand for new construction and development loans.", "Commercial loans attrition slowed compared to the prior quarter falling $282 million compared with $663 million in the first quarter. The loan approval rates have improved meaningfully during the last few months as borrowers' financial health, commercial borrowers has begun to improve. In general, however, we hear from our lenders that businesses remain skittish about expansion and hiring plans, taking a wait and see approach.", "The components of non-interest income and non-interest expense contain less noise than in the prior quarters. The increase in other service charges and the fee income line as a result of several items improving many of which were related to higher transaction volume and interest rate risk management services that we provide to our borrowers. This quarter\u2019s levels are more similar to the 2006 and 2007 period before the crisis.", "In non-interest expense, OREO expense did increase meaningfully this quarter, while several of the banks within our franchise experienced a decline in OREO expense, Utah and Arizona in particular resolved significantly higher volumes of OREO during the quarter and took higher OREO expense in doing so.", "Finally, I'd note that for about I think the fourth quarter in a row had a meaningful decline in other than temporary impairment in the CDO portfolio. It was down to $18 million from $31 million prior quarter and about $100 million if you go back a few more quarters. Barring a significant double dip recession, we would expect this expense to continue to be at very moderate levels and in general continue a declining trend.", "Moving back to credit quality in the loan portfolio. We are encouraged by the lower level of non-accrual loans, down about 6% sequentially. This order of magnitude of improvement is also true when examining our more adversely graded loans, and our delinquent loan level has also improved dropping by 14% or 20% depending upon whether you exclude or include the FDIC supported assets that we acquired last year.", "Construction and land development non-accrual loans fell by 7%. Within construction, we experienced a fairly rapid decline in the commercial construction problem loans and a continued trend of declining residential construction problem loans. Term commercial real estate non-accrual loans fell by 13% compared to the March level and owner occupied commercial real estate non-accruals also fell but by more modest 5%. In general, we continued to see a fairly strong market for term CRE with multiple bidders on properties and properties pricing at healthier levels.", "C&I non-accrual loans have been holding steady at about 3.3% of total C&I loans outstanding. Net charge-offs increased $28 million compared to the prior quarter. Charge-offs are somewhat lumpy. The five largest loan charge-offs in second quarter were $48 million compared to $25 million for the top five in the prior quarter. And we\u2019ve noted that it\u2019s \u2013 charge-offs are probably not going to be a straight line down and perhaps the provision numbers will be more consistently stable to declining.", "But I would say the other way to look at the charge-offs is that most of the increase occurred again in the commercial real categories, both construction and development and in term CRE and there was no one category of term CRE or one geography that showed consistent deterioration. It just was a handful of $1.4 million [ph] and $2 million charge-offs.", "I guess the general picture is we had a consistent decline in problem credits across most of our banks and most of the various loan types, and therefore we do expect losses to continue to trend lower over time. A related note, our provision for credit losses was about 90% of our net charge-off level. However, because of the declines in loan balances, the allowance ratio actually increased and we maintain one of the highest ratios of all regional banks.", "Our quantitative models continue to show declining need for reserves but we actually are viewing with some degree of caution the possibility of an economic indicators deteriorating, possibility of double dip recession etcetera. So we are still holding up the overall reserve in light of that possibility, although there's no indicators in our loan portfolio itself of that at this point.", "Next, migration; I'll review migration trends within the non-accrual loan and OREO categories. Within non-accruals, we expected total new non-accruals of $590 million, down just slightly from $600 million in the prior quarter. We also experienced about $350 million of favorable resolutions, including paydowns, payoffs and upgrades compared to approximately $270 million in the past quarter. Main difference came from payoffs which more than doubled from the first quarter.", "Let me briefly discuss capital. During the quarter, we raised gross $615 million of tier 1 capital, the vast majority of that was common. Net of fees, we added just over $600 million of common and preferred through three methods that are delineated in the earnings release. Our common equity distribution program, an offering of warrants to purchase common stock and a new Series E preferred shares.", "As noted in the release, our tangible equity ratio increased 56 basis points to 6.86% from 6.30% in the prior quarter. That number would have increased significantly more except for the buildup of cash which held up the overall size of the balance sheet. If cash were more in line with historical proportions to loans, the TCE ratio would have been comfortably over 7%, probably around 7.3%.", "So the higher concentration of cash is the primary reason that the regulatory ratios improved at a faster rate than the TCE ratio. Tier 1 common, for example, improved 77 basis points from the prior quarter to 7.91% from 7.14%.", "Summary of guidance for the next quarter and then we'll turn to your questions. We do expect some continued but hopefully moderating somewhat decline in loan balances during the third quarter. But I don\u2019t know that that is going to translate into any change in the overall balance sheet size because we do continue even post quarter end to an experience an increase in DDA balances and in general an increase in deposits.", "So our ability to shrink the balance sheet a whole lot further is questionable at this point. We therefore might expect a core NIM to decline a bit, due to those increased cash balances. And continued loan runoff, which basically converts loan balances earning between 5% and 6% into cash balances earning 25 basis points. We continue to be positioned in a very asset-sensitive position on our interest rate risk management posture, which means we may well positioned for rising interest rates.", "With regard to credit quality, we expect charge-offs to follow a generally declining trend, but with some lumps and based on everything we are seeing now we do expect continued improvement in non-accrual loans and adversely graded loans in the coming quarters. We may experience some modest decline in the allowance in part because loans are shrinking but a major reserve release is still not probably being contemplated until we get significantly more clarity on the outlook for the economy over the remainder of this year and into 2011 in particular, whether or not a double dip recession is on the table or off the table.", "With that I will I think turn it over to the operator to queue up your questions, which those of us in the room here will do our best to answer.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) Our first question in queue comes from David Rochester with FBR Capital Markets. Your question please.", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hi, good evening guys.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Dave.", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Doyle, it seems like you can get a decent amount of margin lift by running off CDs in the back half and shrinking those cash balances. Can you talk about your ability to do that?", "Doyle Arnold", "I don't dispute your point. We are going to be talking with our Executive Management team day after tomorrow about rates paid on CDs and the balances in CDs. There is probably still about $0.5 billion of CDs around the company where that appears to be the only relationship and I'll put that in quotes that we have with that customer. So we're going to be taking a very close look at those. But yes, there is still I think some incremental progress we can make both in deposit balances and in rates paid on deposits. But I have not attempted to quantify that. But I don't disagree with your point.", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks for that. And just one follow-up, can you update us on your risk rated asset reduction strategy and remind us how much benefit you think you may be able to get on that on the right capital ratios if that unfolds favorably?", "Doyle Arnold", "I am not going to give you a detailed update. I think you're referring to \u2013 we've talked about that the significant portions of the CDO portfolio carry very punitive risk weights. Is that basically your question?", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Yes, that\u2019s it.", "Doyle Arnold", "We do continue to work on that and I think it\u2019s increasingly likely that we will have something to say this quarter, probably in the first quarter of this quarter about that. And I think the improvement ratios will be quite noticeable if we pull it off, and I think we will. And with that, I'd ask for your patience because I don't have anything to announce yet but I think we are on track to get something done.", "David Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "All right, great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our next question in queue comes from Bob Patten with Morgan Keegan. Your line is now open.", "Bob Patten \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Good morning, guys.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Bob.", "Bob Patten \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Doyle, just on credit, can you give a little color on the grade migration on the worst part of the portfolio, only for the fact that the criticism isn't for the stuff we know about, it's for the stuff that we don't know, so I just wanted to get a feel for the performing portfolio, maybe a little change in the worst grading portfolio and so forth.", "Doyle Arnold", "I'll take a stab at what I think you're asking, but if I am not we will certainly give you an extra follow up for that. We have seen an actual significant decline over the last six months or so in special mention loans going to classified. We\u2019ve seen a pretty significant decline in the, sort of just in general but rate of new loans being downgraded to a classified status. So basically the healthier part of the portfolio at this point seems to be staying healthy and less and less of it each quarter is deteriorating. I don\u2019t happen to have specific numbers to give you but basically special mentioned loans are declining significantly around the franchise as a whole. Classified loans were down slightly, but they clearly appear to have peaked and the rate of in-flows of new problems is slowing a lot. Is that directionally what you wanted to know?", "Bob Patten \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "That's exactly what I wanted to hear. And the other point was at what point do we see the reported NIM start to go back to the core NIM?", "Doyle Arnold", "Oh, golly. Not more than 4.5 years, because that\u2019s when the sub-debt matures.", "Bob Patten \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "All right.", "Doyle Arnold", "Basically, again, to remind you Bob, two things are going on. One of which is fairly predictable and the other which is beyond our control and we can only report. When we modified the sub-debt in June of last year, simplest way to think of it is we mark it to market. But if nothing else, we still owe the par amount in 2014 and 2015 on maturity, so we have to accrete that discount back and write the debt up over time. That amount that happens quarterly is all scheduled out.", "What changes the schedule and more importantly make each quarter quite lumpy is any time a holder of sub-debt exercises its conversion right and converts it into preferred, that amortization is accelerated. We write it off, that piece all up immediately and then stop amortizing it for that purpose. So I would expect that probably after another few quarters, certainly by the end of 2011 the rate of conversions would go down significantly if it doesn't go down sooner than that. And the reason is, what these holders basically have to do is decide, look at the relative prices on the sub-debt and on the preferred they can exchange into and the relative yields and decide if it's worth it to convert and they're going to be looking at a maturity date in the case of the debt and a call date in the case of the preferred; the call date is about a year sooner than the maturity date.", "So there comes a point when yes, okay, even if I can get a bit of pick up by converting to preferred, I am going to get it for a year less than I would if I just settle my debt.", "So it may continue \u2013 bottom line, we may have a few more quarters of lumps, but then it should I would think start to settle down.", "Bob Patten \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Very clear. Thank you, Doyle.", "Doyle Arnold", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Brian Foran with Goldman Sachs. Your question please.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Brian.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi. My name almost sounded French there.", "Harris Simmons", "It did. I thought you were becoming very sophisticated.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Still pretty simple. I guess one housekeeping question. The tax rate or I guess the level of the tax benefit, I missed it if you explained that, but why is that lower this quarter?", "Doyle Arnold", "We were hoping no one would ask. I will give you the theoretical explanation essentially is that as we \u2013 if you think about it this way we have about $40 million a year of tax advantage income, municipal bond yields, BOLI, it's not taxed. And as we \u2013 if taxable income or loss is very large in relation to that amount, the tax rate is very predictable and it's around effective rates, marginal rate's around 38%. As the taxable portion of our earnings gets closer and closer to zero from either direction the effective tax rate goes berserk and so that's the technical term. I mean, right at zero, it goes to infinity and so it bounces around a lot each quarter when we are in this position.", "And as we try to estimate couple of things what is the total for the year likely to be. How much of it have we already recognized and it's complicated by the discrete items that flow through. We cancel the one BOLI policy this quarter and we will pay $9 million of tax related to that surrender, even if we made no money. We canceled a BOLI policy, a couple of them last quarter and a larger tax penalty. I guess the best way I can \u2013 and then there are few other true-up items in there that went both directions this quarter.", "The best guidance that I think we can give you on taxes is that we currently expect the effective tax rate for the year to average around 30%. And if you look at where it was in the first half of the year that means it\u2019s going to be fairly quite a bit higher than that in the second half of the year. And again, we get to \u2013 as we start to get closer to break even that number will \u2013 the effective tax rate will go way up as you get to a point where you have a little bit of income and it's not easy to figure out. That's about the best I can do, unless James can say it \u2013 he's supposed to be able to explain these things more clearly than I can. But I don\u2019t know that if he can this time. Is that at all helpful Brian?", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "It is. It is. I guess the second one is maybe more straightforward. The C&I competition comments you made, I guess it's striking how similar it was to what First Horizon said last week and I guess the two follow-ups I would have are is it surprising to see competition reemerge to this level this early in the cycle, and then secondly, you guys had that chart a while ago talking about the incremental NIM on new originations. When you look at C&I incremental origination NIMs today, is it just less good but still NIM accretive or has it gotten to the point where it's core NIM dilutive to put new C&I loans on?", "Harris Simmons", "This is Harris. Maybe I'll take a crack at the \u2013 in terms of C&I loan competition, my own view is actually that it's entirely logical what we're seeing right now and that is because the industry is awash in liquidity and in capital. I mean, if you look at capital ratios for the largest banks relative to where they've been two or three years ago, there's a lot of capital there sitting in cash effectively and in the short term I think it\u2019s actually to me it makes a lot of sense that you are going to see lot of price competition.", "This is a little like a fixed-cost kind of an industry where you have \u2013 it's like running an airline with empty seats. Everybody's trying to fill seats. I think my own belief is that as the economy actually start to expand again, you'll see discipline return as companies \u2013 as banks start to see the portfolios grow and approach whatever they think is the longer term required level of capital and start to think in a very much more disciplined way about what pricing is going to have to be over the longer term. And I think that\u2019s why we are seeing it in larger high quality credits.", "Doyle Arnold", "And that\u2019s important. I don't think we are not hearing from our people around our banks that they are seeing cutting of terms and things to reach out for quality. Middle market, CRE, stuff like that, to my knowledge we're really not seeing it there. But on investment grade or near investment grade kinds of larger C&I, we're seeing some competition from.", "James Abbott", "Brian, this is James. I'll just add in talking to small business lenders across the company, we heard that maybe getting 10 basis points or so pressure, pricing pressure on your small business credits where the bigger pressure is occurring is in the larger credits. Then the other question was whether it\u2019s dilutive to NIM on an incremental basis, and it's probably not dilutive to net interest margin. It would be dilutive to the loan yield. But the incremental loans that we put on had a yield of about 5.2% and if you look at what\u2019s happened in the deposit line items, most of the growth came from non-interest bearing and we had run-off in interest bearing. So the net interest margin, which still be accretive on an incremental basis from new production.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "James Abbott", "You are welcome. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Yes, sir. Our next question in queue comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good evening, everyone.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Craig.", "Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I am just wondering \u2013 I didn't see the breakout anywhere. Can you give us the mix between the consumer and commercial restructured loans?", "Doyle Arnold", "No. I think the vast majority of it\u2019s probably commercial but I don't have the \u2013 by far, Jerry Dent's saying. But I don't think we have hard data for you. I don\u2019t know if we could even get that in an hour to follow up with, easily.", "James Abbott", "Actually, we could.", "Doyle Arnold", "We could.", "Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse", "We can touch base after the call on that. Just a second question, though. What level of charge-offs actually came from the restructured loan bucket this quarter?", "Doyle Arnold", "Stump the band twice. I don't think it was a lot.", "Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Small number?", "Doyle Arnold", "I would just say, Craig, we have looked at redefault rates and maybe that's a way to approach this a little bit. Ken Peterson, our Chief Credit Officer is on the line. Ken, you want to touch base on that really quickly?", "Ken Peterson", "Well, I can tell you on the TDRs, probably over half \u2013 not over half, 43% of our troubled debt restructures are still on accrual. And in terms of redefault rates, I don\u2019t know if I have that handy.", "Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Have you guys been using a lot of kind of AB restructured notes or kind of what's \u2013 I'm just wondering if you could change anything with I guess some of the refinancings coming a little bit higher over the last quarter or two.", "Harris Simmons", "We're looking into AB structures. We have not done a lot of those to date, but they are increasingly becoming part of the bag of tricks that we have in looking at these problem loans and increasingly introducing those into discussions with the borrowers. So it is a viable vehicle but not something that we\u2019ve done extensively so far but looking at very seriously.", "Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. We can follow up after the call, if that's okay.", "Doyle Arnold", "All right, Craig, we don\u2019t have the exact number but Jerry Dent is still kibbitzing here with us, even though he's passed his Chief Credit Officer. He is telling me that he is highly confident that the redefault rate on TDRs is under 15%, which is quite a bit lower than I think what you are hearing from rest of the industry.", "Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our next question is queue comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your question please.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, good afternoon, everyone.", "Doyle Arnold", "Hi, Steve.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan", "Maybe we could start, despite what I would call positive turn in NPAs and delinquent loans, the tone seems much more cautious on credit I would say than it was last quarter. How much of this is coming from what you're actually seeing in the loan book and what is it you're looking for before you're comfortable with a larger reserve release if it's not these two trends improving.", "Doyle Arnold", "I would say that essentially none of it\u2019s coming from what we are actually seeing in our loan book and it\u2019s all the \u2013 it's the economic news that makes us cautious. It's the Fed minutes, couple of meetings ago talking about how they would withdraw stimulus and the meetings most recently talking about whether and how they might inject additional monetary stimulus. It's consumer confidence numbers and NFIB numbers and there are positives. There's private sector job growth as well. But there is still a fair number of negative macro kind of numbers out there. We are actually quite pleased in general with what we are seeking in the specifics of our credit portfolio.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan", "May Doyle to follow up. Given your comments on holding more reserves, given this negative economic news, is this pushing out the timing to when you'll ultimately get profitable? I know we had talked about by year-end.", "Doyle Arnold", "I don\u2019t know. As we get \u2013 again it\u2019s kind of like my comment on taxes. As you get closer to the breakeven point it doesn\u2019t take much to swing it one way or the other. I'd just say that I think the overall trends are still positive. And there may be noise along the way, but whether it\u2019s fourth quarter, first quarter, I don\u2019t know. It's going to depend on the way the economy unfolds. Again, we're \u2013 of the stuff we can do and the stuff that we can see we are generally pretty pleased with it.", "Harris Simmons", "I think it's also going to take \u2013 I mean, non-performing assets excluding the FDIC supported stuff, came down about little over 5% during the quarter and I think we\u2019re going to want to see \u2013 that's the right direction but we need to see more of that before we \u2013", "Doyle Arnold", "The level's still pretty high and we\u2019d like to see it \u2013 contemplate much release there.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thanks. Doyle, you mentioned that paydowns were a big driver of the NPA declines in the quarter. Can you just talk about the \u2013 I guess the potential items that would change the NPA balances. I mean, can you have any visibility in terms of paydowns or expectations about NPA in-flows in the next couple quarters?", "Doyle Arnold", "NPA balances were down \u2013 in-flows were down a lot first quarter over fourth quarter. They were only down marginally this quarter. Based on the trends in criticized and classified loans that I\u2019ve discussed I think the trend of new inflows is going to continue to be down as well. But that's something that's just not very easy to forecast on a quarter to quarter basis. But I think that everything we see says the trend there is improving as well.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Doyle Arnold", "So I am not going to try.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "All right. That's fine. And then just going back to the reserve in terms of the timing of the reserve release, I understand you increased your environmental because \u2013 but if your portfolio is not showing deterioration, I guess how long can you reasonably and legitimately wait before you start releasing reserves in a more material way? I know you said you wanted to wait until 2011, but is that possible if the model continues to show improving underlying core credit trends?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, if I talked to the regulators, I could wait a very long time and if I talk to my auditors, I could probably only wait a shorter time. But there is enough uncertainty that I think another quarter or possible two before you have \u2013 as long as \u2013 if there is a double dip, it's going to start to show up here in the next quarter or two and then we won\u2019t be talking about releases for a while. If the economy continues to limp along, improving, albeit at a slow rate, that's probably going to become more clear by the end of year as well.", "And so I don't know, I think somehow or another, we're most likely \u2013 we'll likely hit an inflection point by the end of this year, but you tell me what the economy is going to do and I will give you a better answer.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Understood. All right. Thanks.", "Harris Simmons", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods. Your line is now open.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods", "Good afternoon, gentlemen.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Brian.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods", "Just a quick question and I guess everybody's just talking about the reserve releases. I guess thinking about the macro concerns, maybe you guys can update us on capital plans, exit from TARP, do you feel like all the capital actions you did in the second quarter are the end of the capital raising since the end of the year and I guess timing of TARP repayment.", "Harris Simmons", "I think it\u2019s premature to talk about TARP repayment until we\u2019ve seen a more sustained \u2013 not just leveling of credit quality but actual meaningful improvements in the credit quality trends. We\u2019ve seen them improve. I think it\u2019s going to have to be sustained for at least a couple of quarters before we can start having any serious conversations with the regulators about that.", "We also need to get probably to at least break even or somewhat profitable and have an outlook that calls for sustaining that trend before \u2013 and that again is perhaps couple of quarters away before you can really demonstrate that opposed to project it. And as for overall capital, I'm confident that to the extent that some things count toward TARP repayment and some things don't. I think everything we did in the second quarter counts.", "I don't know that that is sufficient in and of itself, because that will happen when we look at our capital \u2013 that determination will be made when we have a discussion with the Fed after the first two conditions are met, profitability, sustained credit quality improvement. Both of which we think we are on track to achieve.", "Are there any major capital plans in between now and then to load the gun to repay TARP? No, not at this time. Could we still issue more modest amounts of capital to cover losses and make sure than capital ratios that we built up don\u2019t deteriorate prior to having that conversation, that\u2019s something on the table. We haven't made any clear decisions about that, but I'd say that that\u2019s possible.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods", "Okay. And just one real quick follow-up. Earlier Dave's question was about the potential to lower your risk weighting assets on the TARPs [ph]. I guess would the third quarter margin if you're able to do that successfully, would the cost of the wrap, would that lower the net interest margin?", "Harris Simmons", "Assuming there is a wrap, as you call it, there will be a cost to doing it that will affect expenses in the quarter in which it\u2019s done. It\u2019s not the NIM.", "Doyle Arnold", "And it\u2019s not salary expense.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods", "So it's safe to say it will affect pretax, preprovision ROA \u2013", "Harris Simmons", "There you go. Certainly that.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Harris Simmons", "Unfortunately, the lunch is not free.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods", "All right. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Harris Simmons", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Todd Hagerman with Collins Stewart. Your line is now open.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Collins Stewart", "Hi, good afternoon, everybody.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Todd.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Collins Stewart", "Doyle, I just wanted to ask just in terms of the OREO this quarter, I mean it\u2019s been running $360 million or so the last couple of quarters. You mentioned a couple of the banks were a little more aggressive this quarter in their disposal efforts. What's your sense now as you look across the portfolio of things getting marginally better? Can you talk a little bit more just in terms of what was in that expense line and just your outlook in terms of OREO? Is that something that we can get a little bit of relief here on going forward or is that something that should likely stay elevated for a period of time?", "Harris Simmons", "It\u2019s Harris, Todd. I think my expectation is it probably stays somewhat elevated for another couple of quarters. We are trying to be \u2013 we are pushing these banks to be reasonably aggressive in getting rid of this stuff. We have \u2013 one of these portfolios in which we have some of this product is SPA 504 portfolio of national real estate credits we call them. And that\u2019s a portfolio that accounts for roughly I think 30%, 40% of the total of the real estate owned.", "That's the \u2013 we're turning that out on average in about 90 days once it\u2019s booked. We don\u2019t have anything in there that\u2019s been there for more than a year. On average it\u2019s getting in about 90 days. We are trying to accelerate that even a little further. So this holds true for both loan losses well as other real estate owned expenses, charges we take there to the extent that we push a little harder it\u2019s going to take \u2013 it results in a little more loss, typically and so I think with non-accrual levels still is elevated I think we are still going to see over the next couple of quarters higher other real estate owned expense. Until those numbers really start to come down.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Collins Stewart", "Okay. And then I'm assuming \u2013 were there any meaningful gains in that number embedded in that number? Is it mostly write-downs?", "James Abbott", "Todd, this is James. The net gain and loss on REO was basically very close zero on that. There was about $1 million gain. The volume of loans that moves through the REO balance that you guys don\u2019t see but the volume was significantly maybe 30%, 40% larger in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter, the dollar volume of assets moving through the python, so-to-speak.", "Todd Hagerman \u2013 Collins Stewart", "Okay. Terrific. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson. Your line is now open.", "Jennifer Demba \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Hi, good afternoon, everybody. If I missed this in earlier comments, I apologize, but Doyle, do you have any specific guidance for the third quarter reported net interest margin at this point?", "Doyle Arnold", "No, because \u2013 I mean, you can start with the core and then if you know how much sub-debt is going to convert to preferred in September, we won't even know until mid-August and then we will announce it on the \u2013 they have to give us 30 days prior notice and then on the conversion date we actually announce it. I can tell you that because of the amortization the reported will be lower. James, do you have any guidance to give at this point?", "James Abbott", "I was just going to highlight the fact that your cash \u2013 the end of period cash balance was $1 billion, maybe a little better, $1.1 billion over the average cash balance for the quarter and that probably will have \u2013 in the high single digit worth of basis points of compression.", "So the core NIM will compress all else being equal about 7 basis points to 10 basis points just from the cash balance unless we can do something about it aggressively in the next few days here. But from a GAAP basis, we \u2013 it would be very hard to predict, but as to what \u2013 I would note there were two issues that converted, two Q-SIPs that had the eligibility to convert of sub-debt in the second quarter, almost all of the conversion came from one Q-SIP though.", "So that\u2019s perhaps not indicative of that. In the third quarter, it will only be one Q-SIP that is eligible to convert. But it\u2019s hard to know at this point what that number will be.", "Jennifer Demba \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. Thank you.", "Doyle Arnold", "If people had to make that decision as they hadn't made it last week, the economics of converting or not converting to the holder of the debt would have been just about awash. So there is no particular incentive for them to convert. Nonetheless, we know there are some holders that have called in and even though they don't have to tell us formally yet, they told us they plan to convert this quarter; so it just really hard to know, Jennifer. I am sorry.", "Jennifer Demba \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "That's okay. My second question relates to the problem asset disposition market. Have you noticed any meaningful changes as the quarter progressed and as we've entered third quarter, as economic sentiment has kind of dropped?", "Harris Simmons", "I can tell you that if we look at basically the resolution rate on the problem loans during the quarter was about 22% of the beginning of the quarter balance. And so \u2013 I think the resolution rate on problem assets continues to be, we think, pretty good. I think a little better in the second quarter than it was in the first. As you start to get lower flows into kind of the problem credit categories, into graded loans, classified, criticized loan categories that should really start to bring it down if you can keep the resolution rate reasonably high. So far, I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of good resolutions. We go through these kind of one by one on a larger deals and discussions we\u2019ve had internally on the deals in the last couple of weeks I think continues to be reasonably encouraging.", "Doyle Arnold", "I think last in the quarter, we saw more positive surprises than negatives, particularly coming out of Texas, and as Harris said we talked to all of the CEOs and chief credit officers of all the banks once a month and go through loan by loan their larger credits and generally the outlook is still more improving than staying stable or declining.", "Harris Simmons", "I would say that the couple places where things are \u2013 I'd say sort of stable in California, they've done a quite a good job in California in terms of absolute levels. And so even stable there is pretty good story for us; the Nevada economy, if there's one market where things maybe weakening a little further I think it\u2019s probably Las Vegas.", "Jennifer Demba \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "That's helpful. Thank you very much.", "James Abbott", "We are going to \u2013 because we're approaching the end of our hour we are going to take three more questions although we have plenty more beyond that. But let\u2019s take three more questions, each just one question, no follow up and then we will wrap it up at that point.", "Operator", "Yes, sir. Our next question is queue comes from Brian Zabora with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brian Zabora \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Just a quick question on the regulatory side. Could you detail how much you had as far as overdraft fees this quarter and debit interchange that might be impacted by the changing rules?", "Doyle Arnold", "I can tell you that we had about \u2013 you can see it on the service charges line. We had as I recall about $52 million of service charges and fees during the quarter. I can\u2019t tell you how much of that would have been attributable to debit card transactions, ATM transactions, which are really the subject of the Reg E changes. So I don\u2019t know if anybody else around the table has that.", "James Abbott", "I mean, Brian, what we said is if all service charge income from debit and overdraft and so forth went to zero it would be about $30 million a year. It would be a little bit more than that. From what I've heard, this is James, from what I\u2019ve heard there are fairly high opt-in rates which is consistent with what we're hearing out of the industry as well. But probably a little bit too early to make a definitive statement on that.", "Brian Zabora \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Super. I guess with respect to the increase in I guess commercial real estate charge-offs, was there any I guess loan sales and loan markdowns on loan sales that influenced those figures?", "Doyle Arnold", "We are selling loans every quarter. That\u2019s our preferred first. If we can\u2019t get it paid off selling the note not for closing is generally the first \u2013 well, you probably maybe restructure the note if that's possible sell the note. The last thing you want to do is really foreclose. So that\u2019s just an ongoing tool and I don't think there was any particular noteworthy change in the overall mix of resolutions, note sales versus other things.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Got you. I guess secondly, it sounds like I guess you're in a 36-month loss position and it sounds like return to profitability maybe gets pushed out a little bit here. Any further thoughts on where you stand with respect to the DTA?", "Doyle Arnold", "We do still have and we will continue to have some regulatory disallowed DTA. In fact that may I think tick up $20 million or $30 million this quarter. In terms of a GAAP valuation allowance, we still are not anticipating that part based on the fact that the core fundamental drivers toward profitability continue to incrementally improve. So I expect we will have to continue to work to justify it for a couple of more quarters, but I don\u2019t anticipate a disallowance for valuation reserve, I guess for GAAP purposes.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Got it. Thank you.", "James Abbott", "Hi, Jason. I will just add that the disallowed DTA we're estimating at a little over $160 million for the quarter.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "For regulatory.", "James Abbott", "For regulatory purposes.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And that compares to 130?", "James Abbott", "It was 129 last quarter, yes.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our final question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. I guess the only other follow-up would be just curious on this competition you're talking about from new loans, is it really coming from across the board or is it more big banks versus small? And then taking that in combination with your real estate and construction concentration, does this affect at all about what you think a more normalized margin is achievable on a core basis longer term?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, the competition is generally coming from handful of the four or five largest banks in the country. That\u2019s really what we are seeing most notably. I think in terms of, again, my own view is that longer term, that margins are going to be healthier than they were coming into this cycle, simply because I think you are going to have a lot more price discipline from the larger banks as they start to contend with having materially higher equity capital positions and that will be helpful in kind of leveling the playing field somewhat in terms of pricing of various kinds of loans.", "So we'll see. That's my hypothesis, I guess. I think it's notable, as we look at \u2013 if I go back and look at 2006, and look at our taxable equivalent net interest income, 2006 which was about $1.8 billion and if I adjust for the subordinated debt conversions we are experiencing today, we've got taxable equivalent net interest income, equivalent of about $1.980 billion, something like that. It\u2019s actually interesting that even with a runoff and pressure there, and we brought on a lot of assets out of Lockhart several quarters ago that had net pressured margins and the additional cash, we're still seeing really quite healthy pricing on loans.", "The yield on loans this quarter, total loans was up 10 basis points over last quarter, and as James pointed out, incremental pricing, new originations has remained in quite good shape. So we will see. I think if loan demand remains really weak for a protracted period of time, I think that's going to really pressure loan pricing in the near term. I think as things start to grow again, I think we're fundamentally we have a healthier environment in which to price going forward.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Harris.", "James Abbott", "Okay. Thanks everyone. That will conclude our conference call for today. I will be \u2013 we have taken down the names of those who are still in the queue and I will give you a call back as soon as we can. And thank you for your time and your interest in the story today.

This call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the time over to James Abbott, director of investor relations. Please go ahead.", "", "James Abbott", "Thank you. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2010 earnings.", "I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to the statements made in this call. We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call.

During the Q&A section, we will ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, chairman and chief executive officer. Harris?", "", "Harris Simmons", "Thank you very much, James, and thank you to all of you who are joining us this afternoon for our call. We are quite encouraged with our third quarter results, with core pre-tax, pre-credit income relatively stable, moderating rate of decline in our loan balances, and a broad-based improvement in credit metrics, specifically the continued decline in problem credits and a significantly lower rate of inflow into the various problem credit categories.", "Looking at our results, there were several items that obscured some of our core operating trends and we've identified them throughout the release. A good example would be our FDIC indemnification asset. As our credit quality has improved, we write that asset down, it actually increases our non-interest expense. There's some offset non-interest income but you really have to pull some of those items out to get a clear picture. ", "When you adjust for these items, you'll see, I think, that we have relatively stable core earnings before credit costs when compared to the prior quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $0.47 per common share to shareholders, an improvement from a loss of $0.84 per share in the prior quarter. ", "We're pleased with the credit performance - non-accrual loans, delinquent loans, net charge-offs, and provisions all declined compared to the prior quarter. We still have, certainly, work ahead of us. We certainly not have declared victory yet, but we're encouraged with the [inaudible] rate of new, non-accrual inflows and a healthy rate of problem credit resolution. ", "In the third quarter, we resolved more than 20% of our non-accrual and real estate-owned assets, which is consistent with the resolution rate year to date in terms of the amount of the beginning balance that we've been able to resolve during the quarter. ", "As we look at various macro-economic trends within our footprint, we see more signs of emerging optimism than pessimism these days. In the real estate markets we're seeing rental income, though still declining moderately within various major markets within our footprint, is showing signs of stabilizing. Vacancy trends are stable to improving across the majority of our footprint. Furthermore, cap rates are showing some consistent signs of stabilizing during the last several months across a wide variety of geographies and property types. ", "All of these factors facilitate faster problem credit resolution. Importantly, non-accrual term commercial real estate loans declined for the second consecutive quarter, are now down 19% from their peak. Losses from these loans also declined to about a 1.6% annualized charge-off rate of total term CRE loans, down from 2.1% in the prior quarter.", "Finally, we further enhanced both our GAAP and our regulatory capital ratios during the quarter through the issuance of common shares, warrants, preferred stock via sub-debt conversion, and by reducing the risk weighting of certain securities. So we've been very busy this quarter.", "With that overview, I will ask Doyle Arnold, our vice chairman and chief financial officer, to review the quarterly performance.", "Doyle Arnold ", "Thank you Harris. Good afternoon everyone. As noted in the release, we posted a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $80.5 million or $0.47 per diluted common share for the third quarter. That's a significant improvement over the prior quarter and the same quarter a year ago. I'm going to highlight primarily three key areas: revenue, credit, and capital, and then we will take your questions.", "First, the revenue drivers. The GAAP NIM expanded 26 basis points to 3.84%, from 3.58% in the prior quarter. A big driver of that was the fact that the adverse impact of subordinated debt amortization on the NIM was only 35 basis points this quarter compared to 64 in the prior, and that is because a significantly smaller amount of sub-debt exercised its right to convert [its first shares] this quarter than compared to the prior quarter. ", "The core NIM, which [inaudible] amortization of sub-debt and items related to FDIC loan performance compressed 11 basis points to 4.03%, from 4.14%. That's primarily due to the, again, an increase in the average cash balances on our balance sheet as we remain in a very highly liquid position. The yield on loans, excluding the FDIC-supported loans, was stable at 5.60%. ", "Regarding funding, during the quarter we actively worked on reducing excess liquidity where possible, pruning funding sources to better optimize profitability and capital ratios. We worked with a number of business and governmental customers to help them move excess balances into sweep accounts at third-party money market funds, which was the major driver of the linked quarter decline in non-interest-bearing deposits. ", "We were careful to maintain the relationships with the customer, and we anticipate the ability to bring these deposits back on the balance sheet if and as loan demand improves. But loan demand has been soft, although as I'll mention in a minute, as Harris mentioned there has been some improvement. ", "While deposits remain very strong and we still have more cash than we believe desirable on our balance sheet, nevertheless we did shrink the balance sheet by about $1 billion this quarter by reducing these excess deposits in the way indicated. But cash remained a relatively high percentage of total earning assets at 11%, pressuring the net interest margin by more than 40 basis points, compared to historical norms.", "We will continue to try to reduce our excess liquidity during the next several months, ideally through increased lending activity, but also by running off non-core deposits while at the same time retaining core relationships.", "In addition to the excess cash balances, the margin is compressed or pressured by more than 25 basis points due to the level of non-accrual assets and interest reversals as loans are moved into non-accrual status.", "The other key component of revenue is our earning asset base. Period-end loans held for investment declined $459 million to $37.7 billion, or about 1.2% for the prior quarter. That $459 million number is a significant improvement over the prior three quarters, each of which had seen declines in excess of $1 billion. And excluding construction, land development, and FDIC-insured loans, period-end loans were almost flat, declining by only 0.2% sequentially.", "The loan runoff was concentrated almost entirely in construction and development loans, as well as our working down of FDIC assets and there continues to be relatively little demand for construction and development lending and we're still trying to manage those totals downward.", "After several quarters of moderating rates of decline, both C&I and owner-occupied commercial loans showed moderate signs of growth as we discussed borrower demand with our lenders we do get the sense that lending demand is emerging in some areas. Pipelines are getting a bit stronger, although de-leveraging continues to be the more dominant theme.", "The components of non-interest income and non-interest expense contain several items that somewhat obscure core operational results. Starting at the top of non-interest income, capital markets income is stronger due to favorable marks on certain securities purchased for asset liability management purposes. That's the fourth line under non-interest income on page 11, from $10.7 million to $13.2 million second quarter to third quarter. But we do not expect to repeat this gain in the fourth quarter. ", "A little further down, fair value and non-hedged derivative income had an adverse charge of $21.9 million due to the addition of the total return swaps as described in the release and releases earlier in the quarter. This expense is essentially the amount of the premium for the first year of the swap. Assuming that we keep the total return of swaps in place, the next expense for the TRS would occur in the third quarter of next year in an amount of approximately $5.3 million.", "The fixed income securities line contains income related to the repurchase by Global Investment Bank of certain auction rate securities that we hold on our balance sheet. We had purchased these back from our customers when the markets became illiquid and they were held by us at a discount to par so we recognized the loss previously when we bought them from our customers at par but marked them to market on our balance sheet. This bank then in turn purchased them from us this quarter at par.", "We still have some of these auction rate securities on our books that we had repurchased from customers, but the remaining discount that we are carrying is less than $10 million and therefore not likely to be material to future earnings.", "Other fee income, the very last line under non-interest income, of $20.2 million, was larger than usual. The primary driver was a $13.8 million gain recognized on the sale of most of the assets and business operations of our net deposit remote check capture software and service business.", "Moving to expenses, we have broken out a new line item for you. We've collapsed a couple of others that we thought were of less interest, but we've broken out from other a line called \"credit related expenses.\" These are things like foreclosure expense prior to the transfer to OREO, property taxes, legal, appraisal costs, and so on. ", "That number was $17.4 million this quarter, compared to about $17.7 million last quarter and just under $17 million the prior quarter. But a year ago it was running at less than $50 million a year and much much lower than that if you go back a few years prior to the financial crisis and credit downturn.", "So it's now running at an annualized rate of about $70 million. In addition to provisions and OREO expense, this, we think, represents upside to our earnings momentum as credit conditions continue to improve as the economic recovery holds and strengthens.", "The one-time structuring fee, or the total return swap, of $11.6 million, appears in \"other non-interest expense.\" That's the very last line under non-interest expense and that particular expense will not occur for the life of this particular TRS.", "Also included in the \"other non-interest\" expense line item is the FDIC indemnification asset expense of $15 million, or about 80% of the gain recognized in the interest income line. The accounting for the FDIC asset is not intuitive and in fact in many respects is actually rather strange in my humble opinion, and so we have tried on page two of the release to give you a bit of a roadmap to make some sense out of this. But I think rather than dwell on that, if you have questions I'll defer them to James after the call.", "The bottom line message is that we acquired these assets for a price of less than we thought they were worth at the time and as you may recall we booked significant additions to capital through the bargain purchase gain and while there are various pools here, some are doing a little worse, some about the same, some better. ", "The net net of all of that is they are doing better even than we expected at the time that we purchased them. So we purchased them for cheaper than we expected to get, and we're doing a little better than we expected. That's what you really need to know. For the details, good luck, and James will try to walk you through it.", "In that other expense line, if you take out the $11.6 million one-time TRS and the indemnification asset expense, it's a bigger expense than the prior quarter. That other non-interest expense line is relatively flat also on a recurring basis.", "Finally, I want to highlight the OTTI, the other than temporary impairment of our CDO portfolio. This increased somewhat from the prior quarter to $23.7 million from $18.1 million. The driver of the increase is the Dodd-Frank Act, and that component of the act, as some of you may know, is the Collins Amendment, which on a phase basis disallows the inclusion of trust-preferred securities for tier one capital purchases by larger banks. ", "We expect that this will result in early redemptions of trust-preferred by banks that are strong enough to do so and therefore increase the pre-payment speed. And this in turn has the impact of reducing the support to the rest of the CDO structure, particularly the lower-quality tranches. So we've modified our modeling assumptions to take that into account and if not for that change the OTTI reported here would have been $12.1 million, just based on actual bank failures as opposed to the $23.7 million that we reported. ", "Given the reduced number of banks newly deferring, and an apparent stabilizing rate of bank foreclosures, our long-term expectation is that expense will continue to be stable to declining over the next few quarters.", "Moving to credit quality, as you've noticed there was a broad-based improvement in credit this quarter, some of which we alluded to at a conference in September, at a high level, non-accrual loans, excluding FDIC loans, declined by about 8% sequentially. You can find the actual numbers on page 13 of the release. The earliest leading indicator of problem credits, so-called special mention loans, actually fell by 17%, which was a significant acceleration compared to the prior quarter's 6% decline.", "New, non-accrual loans, i.e. loans that were first placed on non-accrual status in the quarter, were $426 million, down from $591 million in the prior quarter. So we're seeing a reduced rate of inflow of new non-accruals and new special mention inflows were a very small total percentage of the total balance, which is encouraging.", "On the other side, our quarterly resolution rate of problem loans remained relatively stable. We're resolving in the 20% to 25% of the total pile of NPAs - at the beginning of the quarter we're resolving by the end of that quarter - and additionally during the third quarter a higher percentage of the NPA resolutions came from favorable resolutions as opposed to unfavorable. Nearly three quarters of the resolutions came as the result of upgrades and pay-downs and pay-offs, rather than charge-offs and charge-downs, etc. And that three quarters favorable rate is up from about 60% just six months ago.", "In conclusion, combining the slowing inflows and diminishing deterioration up the pipeline we expect to see further improvement in NPAs in coming quarters, assuming that the economy remains reasonably stable. The ratio of allowance to credit losses was essentially unchanged as a percent of loans, 4.34% versus 4.37% last quarter, which is consistent with our position on releasing reserves. We felt it was still a bit too early in the economic recovery to release a significant amount.", "Construction and land development non-accrual loans fell by 11%. Within construction, we continue to experience a strong rate of decline in commercial construction problem loans, down by more than 35% since year end. Residential construction problem credits also declined and are down nearly 30% since year end. Problem loans here means classified loans, our more severely graded loans, and that's a category that has driven most of our losses as you might well understand.", "Term commercial real estate non-accrual loans fell by about 6% compared to the prior quarter's level, and owner-occupied commercial real estate non-accruals also fell at a similar rate, which is consistent with the prior quarter's rate of decline. And finally, C&I non-accrual loans declined about 11% sequentially. ", "Switching to losses, net charge-offs to loans fell 14 basis points to 2.50%, from 2.64% in the prior quarter. So basically what you've got are a declining loss rate and a declining pile of problem loans from which most of those losses are emerging and therefore we do expect losses to trend lower as we move through the remainder of this year and throughout 2011. Actual charge-offs declined in several categories this quarter, including term CRE, construction, and owner-occupied commercial. ", "And finally, a little bit on capital during the quarter. We did raise a net of $110 million of common equity, net of fees and commissions, with about two-thirds coming through the issuance of new common shares and one-third through our auction of warrants to buy common shares in the future.", "As noted, our tangible common equity ratio increased 17 basis points to 7.03%, at 6.86% in the prior quarter. The tier-one common improved by an estimated 86 basis points from the prior quarter to approximately 8.77% from 7.91%. Our risk-weighted assets declined by approximately $4.5 billion, or 9.5% sequentially. Most of that, about $4 billion of the risk-weighted asset reduction, was due to the total return swap, and about $500 million was the decline in loans.", "Summary of guidance for the next few quarters, first on the balance sheet, loan balances appear to be shifting from significantly declining rates to stability in some categories, particularly when you exclude construction and FDIC-supported loans. Whether or not the overall balance increases or declines in the near term is difficult to forecast. Over the longer term, however, we do believe that nascent signs of stability in categories such as C&I and owner-occupied loans may develop into more consistent growth.", "Anecdotally we are hearing from a number of our banks that their pipelines of commercial type lending opportunities are strengthening, and are better than they have been in some time. You'll see in the release the information about the number of gross new originations and renewals during the quarter.", "We will continue to try to work down excess liquidity and reduce these non-core deposits as a way to shrink the overall size of the balance sheet and the drag on earnings that results from parking that cash at the Fed. Therefore, we would expect the core margins may be stable to improved somewhat in the fourth quarter due to reduced cash balances and those ongoing efforts to reduce non-relationship deposits. ", "Although there's a fair amount of chatter among investors within the industry regarding the industry's inability to reduce deposit costs, we believe that we still have some leverage to pull in this area, and furthermore organic loan production, including renewals, continues to be accretive to the margin, despite the increased pricing pressure by some major national banks. And long-term, we remain asset sensitive, which means we think we're quite well-positioned for a rising rate environment. ", "To guard the credit quality, we expect charge-offs to generally decline over the next several quarters, although it will be somewhat lumpy. The decline in the fourth quarter may be modest because [inaudible] to press our banks to aggressively recognize losses and reduce problem loans and get them dealt with. But as I mentioned earlier, the general credit quality trends are very encouraging at this point.", "We'll expect, therefore, non-accrual loans and other adversely graded loans to continue to recede at a healthy pace, and we continue to experience modest declines in the allowance for loan losses although again we'll be cautious about reducing it significantly until there is a greater degree of certainty regarding the strength of the economy.", "What we see internally looks good, but we are mindful that external observers like IHS Global and others have weaker forecasts for the next year in the economic environment now than they did a quarter ago. So that's the source of our caution.", "Tax rate. For those of you building your models we know this number has been a bit erratic for us as estimates of taxable and non-taxable income have changed over this year. We expect the effective tax benefit rate will be between 46% and 47% in the fourth quarter. ", "And finally, as a result of selling a majority of the assets of net deposit, a few line items will change going forward, but rather than spending a lot of time on that, the net impact of net deposit, apart from the gain we reported this quarter - the impact on earnings was, I think, about a loss of a penny or two a share annualized over the last couple of quarters. So it has very little ongoing impact on earnings and to the extended debt it's probably slightly positive.", "With that, I think we will turn to your questions, so operator, if there are any already queued up we'll take them. Otherwise we'll wait for you to pose a question and then we'll be happy to talk to you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Our first question in queue comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods", "Doyle, I'm looking at the end-of-period balances. So deposits have come down compared to average and so have the money market assets. Maybe you can kind of give us an idea, where do you think the margin could be headed here into the fourth quarter versus that core adjusted margin that you guys disclosed during the third?", "Doyle Arnold ", "A couple of comments. First of all, a lot of the reduction, particularly the reduction in DDA balances that occurred in the third quarter occurred in the month of September, so if nothing else changed we would see a further decline in average balances in the fourth quarter in deposits just because of the pattern of when that occurred. I don't think we expect to have as dramatic a change in the actual balances in the fourth quarter, but you'll get a few hundred million at least of average balance decline.", "And we do continue to try to push out some non-relationship CDs as they come up for renewal, etc. So I think what I said with regard to the margin is that margins probably stable to maybe slight upward pressure, but I think we're comfortable that the core margin is in the low fours, but I can't pin it down to within a few basis points for you.", "Brian Klock", "Okay. And then my last question here, just on the construction. You continue to work the construction down. Was there any of that, or can you kind of gauge how much of that was termed out, anything that rolled over from construction to permanent?", "Doyle Arnold ", "I don't think we have that with us here today. We will try to find an investor forum later in the quarter perhaps to get that. But we have not analyzed that yet.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "Could you talk a little bit about, in terms of your outlook for loan growth, can you give us a little bit of detail on where the utilization rate stands right now by - I don't know if you have any detail by loans. And where do you expect that you could see some improvement on that front?", "James Abbott ", "The utilization rate is unchanged linked quarter. There was some movement month to month, but unchanged, and it's around 38% or so.", "Harris Simmons", "It's up just one percent from last quarter.", "James Abbott ", "On a percentage point, yeah. [Laughter.]", "Harris Simmons", "On a percentage point from 37% to 38%, really down from a high in the low forties a year ago.", "Doyle Arnold ", "It's been stable, relatively stable, in the high 30s now, for about three quarters.", "John Pancari", "Doyle, I know you mentioned that reserve releases are probably modest near term, I guess if you can just help us understand the timing of when you think, given its trajectory right now in non-accruals and in your delinquency trends, how soon we could expect a more material reduction in the reserve levels.", "Doyle Arnold ", "Well, that is a very good question, and I will just point out the obvious, that there's probably a real tension between what the regulators would like to see, which is little or no reserve release ever, and what GAAP would indicate, which is if the likelihood of a recession that begins to fade, and therefore the loss content inherent in the portfolio today continues to look more favorable, then we've got to release more reserves at some point. The qualitative adjustment to the quantitative reserve calculation, which was - that adjustment between what the pure quantitative factors would indicate was a bit over $200 million last quarter. It was over $300 million this quarter. So the qualitative adjustments have gotten larger and that may not be sustainable for more than another quarter or two before we have to start making some change in the reserves, unless the economic outlook does continue to be very cloudy. And as I indicated there are some macro-observers, including the Fed, that clearly have come to believe that the macro outlook today is not as favorable as it was a few months ago. So we're going to remain cautious until it becomes clearer that the recovery is on a firm footing.", "John Pancari", "And then lastly, if I can just ask on capital, and particularly on TARP. Are you getting any additional color from the government in terms of the capital raise that could be required to get out of TARP or are they really going to look at how much you've already done and take that into consideration. Just trying to get some type of detail around how much you could have to raise.", "Doyle Arnold ", "We have no clarity. In fact we've had no meaningful conversations on that point to date.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities", "Yes, I have two questions. One was as we're seeing asset quality, especially non-performers, delinquent loans, OREO all starting to move down nicely, it starts to put us on the back side of the asset quality cycle, and we've raised $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion worth of the capital in the last two quarters. How are we starting to feel about - with TARP out there and with the capital that we need, how much more capital issuance should we expect as we're really starting to move on the back side of some of these pressured issues?", "Doyle Arnold ", "Well, I think as we indicated on last quarter's call we will probably continue to raise very modest amounts of capital as long as we are not profitable, and in particular not sufficiently profitable to cover the preferred dividends. But those numbers are getting generally smaller every quarter now and eventually will go to zero. As we get closer to that point that's when it would be more appropriate to have discussion with the Fed and others about TARP repayment plans. In addition to having a very large loan loss reserve in the face of significantly improving credit metrics, we've also pushed a lot of capital down into our banks, and that's where those credit metrics are improving. So at some point we would hope to withdraw some of that capital back to the parent. But what the mix is going to be of all of that to repay TARP not sure, but there's no plan to raise significant amounts of capital right now prior to having that TARP discussion, just very modest amounts for reasons that we've previously indicated.", "James Abbott ", "I think too that a significant factor in all of this is what happens to commercial real estate losses, in particular the term portfolio. That's been a source of concern for a lot of observers. So far that is not playing out in our portfolio and has been reasonably benign around the industry and a lot of indications are that that market's commercial real estate is stabilizing and even strengthening. If you look at CMBS spreads and some other indicia of this it's appearing that maybe we're not going to see the kind of storm some had predicted. But I think until it's clear, it's going to take another two or three quarters perhaps before it's really clear, that there aren't substantial losses around the industry in that product type and if that happens my hope would be that regulators would become more comfortable with reliance on existing capital and capital ratios as we start to think about what it will take to repay TARP.", "Marty Mosby", "And Doyle, I wanted to recap some of the items, just real quickly. On the favorable side this quarter we had $4 million on mark on securities. We had about a net $7 million security net gains, and about $14 million gained on the sale from the net deposit unit. That's about $35 million of favorables. If you take the two total return swap issues, $22 million in the premium and then $12 million on the structuring, which at least next three quarters aren't there, that's about $34 million. So those two things kind of net out. And then you end up with $28 million negative from discount accretion, and then another $24 million in trust impairment. You put those together and you've got about a $50 million negative left hanging out there. You could see some pretty strong improvement over the next couple quarters. So to the degree a lot of your losses are coming out of these two items, and leading capital to just cover these two things, if they improve you should see some relief I would think.", "Doyle Arnold ", "I would think. [Laughter.]", "Marty Mosby", "Any other thoughts about the progress on those two line items?", "Doyle Arnold ", "We will announce later this week, I guess about an hour and 12 minutes ago was the deadline by which holders of sub-debt eligible for conversion had to give notice if they planned to convert. So we will announce within two or three days what amount we'll convert this quarter and our estimate of the drag fourth quarter on earnings from that. It will, based on what we've seen so far, that number will continue to be meaningful in the fourth quarter and I won't try to narrow it down any more than that. ", "I think your other one was the TruPs OTTI, was that the other one you highlighted? ", "Marty Mosby", "Yeah.", "Doyle Arnold ", "Barring a big surprise there, the general trend is that we think the worst of that's behind us and the trend is stable to improving there. So you've got those two items and then the other one is of course the one we've already had several questions on, which is reserve release, or how much under-provision can we prudently allow to take place going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "When you think about your non-performing loan balances, it looks like in total the NPA reduction is accelerating, and that's great. But when you look at the composition it looks like a lot of the reduction is coming from the construction loans with less of a decline in commercial, but still down of course. One of your competitors highlighted the risk that as more of the non-performers became commercial as opposed to construction the pace of NPA reductions would decline. Do you find that might be the case in your portfolio as well, or is there any reason to think you can more quickly resolve a lot of the commercial non-performers?", "Doyle Arnold ", "I think we do have several large commercial non-performers that are headed toward favorable resolution and as I cautioned James earlier today in how we characterize this I'll caution you in the use of the word \"accelerating\". That is a true statement historically over this quarter compared to prior. I don't know how far out to extrapolate a positive second derivative on top of a favorable first derivative. But we're not at the point yet where we think that it's going to get a lot harder to resolve C&I credits compared to construction and CRE credits.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan", "I just want to follow up on John's question regarding the reserve release. Doyle, given the tension you talk about with the regulators who want to keep the reserve higher, what's the key variable you need to see change to give you the flexibility to really drop the reserve here? Is it more a function of the inflows into non-performer, the charge-off levels, or is this view on the broader economy really key here?", "Doyle Arnold ", "How many angels can dance on the head of a pin? [Laughter.] I don't - ", "Harris Simmons", "I think that clearly substantial reductions in non-performing assets, our internal grading of assets, if that significantly improves that is a very substantial factor in the way we calculate reserves and is likely to remain so for some time. As that's coming down, we are trying to be very careful about not simply letting non-performing asset levels drive the reserves entirely then. We're trying to make sure we're reasonably conservative in what is still a very uncertain economic climate. But I do think internally the pressures to release reserves will accelerate as non-performing assets continue to come down. I think there's no question about that. Otherwise, too much of this becomes simply qualitative concern about future and certainly we don't have any corner on views as to what the future's going to be. But we're trying to be careful about it.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Harris, maybe if I could follow up - on prior calls you had expressed the hope at least to reach profitability by the end of this year. Is your optimism at least to get the provision down below pre-tax pre-provision? Has your optimism been tempered a bit? In other words, has that view been pushed out here?", "Harris Simmons", "First thing I'd say is our view about releases is not linked to any determination as to when we want to become profitable. I wanted to become profitable long ago. So we try to make a determination about what we're going to do with reserves independent of any goal that we might have to be profitable in a particular quarter. And I think all of you are smart enough to be able to do math and figure out - you'll have your own views as to core profitability, etc. So I think it's becoming clear to us that the trends in non-performing assets, classified loans, etc. are improving at a pace that we are likely to be profitable here reasonably soon. I don't know if that's the fourth quarter or the first quarter, but I expect that we're going to see - if the internal trends we're seeing continue to play out, in terms of resolution problems and a significant decrease in the amount of new problems coming into the front end of the hopper, that the calculations will be such that you'll see increased releases. It's really premature for us to be hazarding a guess as to the amount of that, and thus the timing of returning to profitability.", "Doyle Arnold ", "What we've said, I think, for at least two quarters now, maybe even longer, was that we thought return to profitability late this year or very early next year. I still stand by that. Trying to narrow it down any more than that is very difficult because there are three or four really big moving parts here. The core pre-tax, pre-credit cost earnings have held up remarkably well through all of this. We're very very pleased about that. The credit costs are trending favorably. The OTTI costs are trending favorably. But then we have this other thing that is not necessarily economically linked and is out of our control, which is the sub-debt to preferred conversions, and those can be large enough that they could postpone profitability at quarter. They could send us back to unprofitability for a quarter after returning to profitability. They're a non-cash item. It just depends on how you're modeling and recommending to investors to look at that. And I don't know how all of you are treating that item. The things that are somewhat under our control are generally looking fairly good, and that one's a bit more volatile.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Your questions please. ", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the progress you made this quarter on terms of deposit re-pricing and specifically in lowering some of your money market rates in the quarter, and how much of that would have been reflected in the third quarter and maybe more in the fourth.", "Doyle Arnold ", "I would say that we've really put the pressure on our banks to take another hard look at this in meetings we had with them in August. One of our banks, for example, in late August or September, dropped its rate on term CDs, if you have no other product with us, from 40 basis points to 5 basis points, which means basically it's a not open for business sign for that product, and we're basically not opening any more of those. A lot of the adjusting that took place took place in September, so I do think you'll see more. The full impact didn't show through in this quarter. You could expect more reduction, I think, in funding costs in the fourth. It's not going to be dramatic, because you've got to wait for CDs to renew, etc., but mid-single digits basis point reduction is not unreasonable to expect I would think. You have a different view James?", "James Abbott ", "No, that's probably fair. One of the things I was going to highlight is the cost of CDs sitting in the 120 range for the quarter on the balance sheet and new production for CDs for the quarter was down around 60 or so basis points.", "Doyle Arnold ", "I would think in September it was probably lower than that.", "James Abbott ", "It was actually relatively stable, but anyway. That gives you kind of an order of magnitude on what costs can do on CDs. Money market there's a wide range of ways to look at that, but maybe we'll take that question off line as far as how to look at the industry there.", "Joe Morford", "Okay. And then I guess a separate follow up question was just following up on the loan growth. It sounds like across the board you're seeing some more stability. I was curious if any of the banks or markets are showing stronger trends than others, more positive trends than others, and do you have much of an appetite right now at all for non-owner-occupied term CRE lending?", "Doyle Arnold ", "I think yes. You know, there's stuff that you can finance now. Generally it's well structured, it's well supported by owners' equity, favorable, good terms and rates, so yes, we are making new term CRE loans.", "Harris Simmons", "And again, just a reminder. Our market is not the trophy high rise office building major city downtown, it's a different, more exurbs, suburbs, middle market type of CRE. I don't think the cap rate swings and other valuation indices are as violent as they are in some of those trophy CMBS type markets.", "Joe Morford", "And are those opportunities coming across your footprint, are you seeing some markets better than others?", "James Abbott ", "They're primarily coming in the Texas and California markets. That's where the sun is starting to shine a little earlier than the other states.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.", "Jennifer Demba \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Just wondering if you had any changes in thoughts about M&A versus a couple of months ago now that credit costs are continuing to decline.", "Doyle Arnold ", "No change in our thoughts at the moment. We're not seeing attractive things to bid on at the FDIC. And the terms offered by the FDIC are worse, the pricing on the successful bids are worse, and the quality of the franchises are all much worse than what we actually bid on and won a year ago.", "Jennifer Demba", "And one follow up question on origination -", "Doyle Arnold ", "I would just add one other thing. You know, one of the things that seems to be happening, at least in our territory, and you're probably aware of this, is that those institutions that are troubled enough to probably want to consider selling but not so troubled that there's no franchise value have had some success in recapping themselves during the quarter as opposed to selling themselves. So you are seeing the sick get sicker and go down, but those that had pneumonia but there's a doctor at hand are curing, and that frankly is helping our trust-preferreds recover as well. So just a little elaboration on my previous answer.", "Jennifer Demba", "The origination jump you had from second quarter, was any of that seasonable do you think in nature?", "Doyle Arnold ", "Seems to be more of a trend line. I think if you went back a couple of quarters earlier the gross new origination somewhere late last year or very early this year were down about $1 billion or so or even slightly less than that. And we've seen increases of a few hundred million each quarter, still not enough - so we're double the low point but it's still not quite enough to fully offset the charge-offs and the pay-downs and other things, but we're getting closer.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue comes from Brian Zabora with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "Brian Zabora \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Just a question on competition on loan size, which you touched on a little bit, but is, compared to say 90 days ago, is competition still mostly in the larger high-quality, investment-grade C&I loans, or do you think it's spread at all?", "James Abbott ", "Just anecdotally I think it's still in remains in larger investment-grade or call it [inaudible] you see it most significantly. As I said everybody's looking for good earning assets. I'm sure there's some of that at other levels, but where we're hearing about it tends to be with the larger clients.", "Brian Zabora", "And just a question on charge-offs in the C&I category. It's up a bit from last quarter, $72 million versus $52 million in second quarter. Was there any sizable charge-off in there?", "Doyle Arnold ", "I don't think there was any one noteworthy one.", "Operator", "Our final question for today comes from Peter [inaudible] with Carlson Capital. Please go ahead.", "Peter [inaudible] - Carlson Capital", "I wanted to applaud the moves you guys took on the high-cost funding and the lending origination and renewals. It all looks like headed the right way for the P&L, and thank you for sharing the qualitative reserve with us, because we can do a little bit of math and figure out where you would have been without it, which looks good.", "I was wondering, we saw the warrant issue, right? Was that in addition to the $200 million DRIP, or was that part of the $200 million DRIP. ", "Doyle Arnold ", "Well, we announced that we had authorization for a $200 million DRIP. We did not indicate that we expected to use all of it ever, and we didn't use all of it in the quarter, so this was a separate capital issuance, but you shouldn\u2019t necessarily take the warrant and add it to the $200 million and say they're going to go issue $235 million of common equity.", "Peter [inaudible]", "Well, here's what I'm trying to do, right? We're all trying to gauge, as we talked about on the call, reserve release, when, if, depends on the environment, Q4, Q1, profitability, well we don't know, but it looks like we're headed in the right direction. What I'm trying to figure out is can I use this $200, right? Take out the $75 million that you issued, that you told us in the release, take out this $36 - $100 all together is $90 million, right? And I'm trying to say is it reasonable if I extrapolate the current environment and I know everything's conditional, but if nothing else were to come up on the environment to the negative side is it reasonable to assume that that is the cumulative pain that you guys see that is left?", "Doyle Arnold ", "Boy, you're trying to nail me down with it. You're basically trying to get me to forecast the cumulative losses over the next two quarters and say they're not - [Laughter.]", "Peter [inaudible]", "I know I'm not going to be able to nail you down, Doyle. Directionally, am I in the ballpark?", "Doyle Arnold ", "You're more or less in the ballpark, but again, back to some of the earlier questions - ", "Peter [inaudible]", "Right, the caveats. Gotcha.", "Doyle Arnold ", "The caveats about TARP in particular. We've had some discussion about to what degree, what will \"count\", etc., etc.", "Peter [inaudible]", "No, I'm just trying to get in the green. I know the Feds are a whole other issue, but hopefully they'd give you some credit for where your tier one common is and your TCE is, blah blah blah, right? The reserve levels. So I've got to imagine some people over there doing some math, but hey listen, thanks for taking my call guys.", "Doyle Arnold ", "If the Fed and the OCC are listening on the call please take careful note of what the gentleman has said. [Laughter.]", "Peter [inaudible]", "Well, NPA formation down 28%, that was my key. That, to us, is early-stage. You guys see stuff way up further the pipe that's early-stage to you, but we feel cool when we're looking at the [Y9Cs and CMPA] formation down 28%, because that should lead to lower charge-offs in the future, so thanks for sharing that metric.", "James Abbott ", "Okay, thank you very much everyone for your time.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the time over to Mr. James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.", "James Abbott", "Good evening, and we welcome you to this conference call to discuss our first quarter 2011 earnings. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to the statements made in this call. We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. If you do not yet have a copy of the release, it is available as an Adobe Acrobat file at zionsbancorporation.com.  We will limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] ", "With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris?", "H. Simmons", "Thank you very much, James, and welcome to all of you. We're very pleased to report a return to profitability this quarter. As you see in our numbers, the primary driver of this is the linked-quarter improvement in loan loss provision expense. And this was made possible by a significant reduction in net loan charge-offs, which we believe has improved to a level that is at least sustainable. And we would actually expect to see further improvement as we continue to move through 2011.", "We also experienced a continued reduction in classified loans and nonaccrual loans. Classified loans declined 11% compared to the prior quarter and a very substantial 41% compared to the year ago period, so we're clearly making -- continuing to make progress on the asset quality front. ", "Macroeconomic trends across our footprint during the first quarter also continued to show improvement from the already encouraging fourth quarter trends. The first quarter marked really kind of a shift in the number of promising signs in just a few of our major markets' deposit trends across nearly our entire footprint. We saw rental income for all of the major property types improving in a great majority of our markets. Similarly, cap rates have continued to exhibit some favorable trends. Vacancy rates also improved across the majority of property types in the footprint. And all of these factors should facilitate further problem credit resolution and improved loan growth going forward.", "Finally, I'd like to highlight the emerging growth in commercial and industrial loans, which increased at a 5% annualized rate compared to the prior quarter, so we're seeing some moderate acceleration there. 6 of the 8 banks in our company experienced growth, and thus the growth was more geographically diversified to the prior quarter. We also experienced growth in term commercial real estate, owner-occupied and consumer loans. As we look forward, we expect that lending is going to continue to strengthen at a moderate rate.", "We are certainly looking forward to the time when we can begin to further rationalize our capital structure. That's obviously one of the things that's creating some drag on the earnings available to common. But at some point in the not distant future, we expect we'll be able to start to make some inroads there. ", "Doyle Arnold, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, will now go through the quarterly performance. Doyle?", "Doyle Arnold", "Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, everybody. As noted in earnings release, we posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $14.8 million or $0.08 per diluted common share for the first quarter. In the first paragraph of the release, we've also presented the earnings in a way that excludes the non-cash sub debt amortization and the accretion on discount on FDIC-assisted loans. We think this is useful to longer-term oriented investors, as we do not expect those income expense items to be with us in the perpetuity. On that basis, earnings improved to $0.29 per share from a loss of $0.25 a share last quarter. ", "Additionally, we did point out one item in the press release, an after-tax income item of about $0.06 per share from loans recently determined to be covered by FDIC indemnification. Essentially, we bid on one of the -- the last failed bank in California on a balance sheet as of a particular date. The transaction closed on a later subsequent date. And during the interim period, a number of loans had been charged off and not -- with no reflection of any loss-sharing agreements, we discussed with the FDIC and they ultimately agreed that those loans should have been covered by loss sharing. So the $18.9 million represents a onetime, one-event income item from the FDIC which we received in the first quarter, and therefore this item won't recur. ", "In the rest of our remarks, I'll highlight three key areas: revenue, then a bit more detail on credit and then finally capital and then a few miscellaneous items and some guidance. And then we'll take your questions.", "First, revenue drivers. I'll start this time with loan growth within certain segments, which is a story that seems to be gaining traction. On Page 12 of the release, you will note that broadly, the loan portfolio declined by about 0.5% sequentially, which compares reasonably favorably to the industry's loan decline of 2% based on Fed H8 data, which of course we haven't seen a lot of earnings releases yet this quarter to confirm that. But more importantly I think, we experienced healthy growth in C&I loans up 1.2%, even though line utilization rates declined very moderately to 34.8% from 35.8%. The consumer loans increased by about 0.9% sequentially, driven primarily by 1- to 4-family housing mortgages.", "In the commercial real estate category, we again experienced a large decline in construction and land development loans totaling $612 million. To give you -- anticipating perhaps some of the follow-up questions on the decline, about $296 million of that was financed by us into term CRE as construction is completed and leased up, stabilized. This explains most of the increase in term CRE for the quarter. As you recall from investor presentations and discussions, we don't convert construction loans and term loans unless and until the loan meets our general terms CRE underwriting guidelines.", "During the quarter, we charged off $48 million of construction loans or about 8% of the gross decline of a little over $600 million. That's actually an improvement from 12% charge-off of the declining balance in prior quarter and in the high teens to low 20s for the 4 quarters prior to that. So even as we've worked down a very large part of the original construction and development portfolio, the loss content in the remaining portfolio does not seem to be getting more severe. In fact, it seems to be improving as a general statement. Factoring in a modest amount of production, approximately $300 million of construction loans were financed away from us. Don't have hard data on this, but anecdotally we know that life insurance companies were somewhat more active in term lending and other banking organizations also financed some of those loans.", "We're aware of some analysts that still expect very large charge-offs from our remaining $3.0 billion of construction loans, which as I pointed out is down from about $7.2 billion a little over 3 years ago. Some of these forecasts, we think, have even $1 billion or more of loss coming out of that portfolio, representing a very large portion of the remaining balance. Given recent experience, it doesn't seem likely to us that such scenarios are going to materialize. As I point out, the current loss rate is running around 8% to 10% or so of all of the loans that kind of roll off our balance sheet.", "On Page 16, the GAAP NIM expanded 27 basis points to 3.76% from 3.49% in the prior quarter. The core NIM, which excludes the accelerated amortization of subordinated debt discounts and items related to FDIC loan outperformance, that core NIM was actually quite stable. We calculate it at 4.06% versus 4.07% in the prior quarter. And I think this is broadly consistent with the guidance we've been giving throughout. ", "The adverse impact of sub debt amortization on the NIM was 36 basis points, which compares to 62 in the prior quarter. And note that a lot of this impact shows up as the cost of long-term debt, which was 18.8% in the first quarter, substantially due to the accelerated discount and amortization. ", "The average yield on loans declined modestly, 5 basis points to about 5.51%. We continue to make some advances in lowering interest-bearing deposit costs, which declined 4 basis points. And we've also had continued improvement in the mix of deposit funding. Average balances in the interest-bearing categories declined very modestly, while noninterest-bearing deposits increased in the modest case.", "So non-interest-bearing deposits continued to grow, while interest-bearing deposits declined. Net deposits declined $343 million or just slightly more than loan attrition, leaving the loan-to-deposit ratio at 90%. As we can convert more of our excess cash into better earning assets like loans, that represents a NIM and revenue expansion possibility.", "In addition to the excess cash balances, the NIM is pressured by approximately 20 bps due to nonaccrual assets and interest reversals on loans moved into nonaccrual status. ", "Finally, the balance sheet remains fairly asset-sensitive. Under a scenario where interest rates rise 200 basis points in a parallel shift and some $5.3 million of non-interest-bearing deposits ...", "H. Simmons", "Billion.", "Doyle Arnold", "Billion, $5.3 billion, of non-interest-bearing deposits or other low-cost deposits were replaced with market-rate funds, we would expect to see about a 6% increase in net interest income under some various nonparallel shifts in the yield curve. We still remain asset-sensitive, although less so than would be implied by the 6% increase that I just described.", "A little additional detail on credit coming from Page 13. Nonaccrual inflows again declined about 9% from the prior quarter to $337 million. As Harris mentioned earlier, we've also added a history of classified loans to this page, the very last line. As you can see that basically over the last year, classified loans have declined from about $5.1 billion down to -- or $5.2 billion down to just over $3 billion, a decline of about $2.1 billion in 1 year. ", "The rate of problem credit resolution slowed somewhat compared to the prior quarter, again I think consistent with our guidance. But I would note that we still worked through more than 470 loans of at least $50,000 in size during the quarter. It's down from 660 loans the prior quarter, but well above the average in 2010, which was more like 200 problem loans per quarter. ", "Loss severity as measured by loss given classified status, that is how much do we lose on classified loans, continued to trend slightly better for the portfolio overall. C&I loss severity improved the most, while most of the other categories were modestly better or stable.", "Let me touch quickly on troubled debt restructurings. Also on that page, you'll note that they declined about 6% in total. Driving the majority of the decline is the A/B note structure where the A note is underwritten at market terms, thus removing that portion of the loan from TDR [troubled debt restructures] status. ", "As a sidebar on this topic, you'll note the SEC just released guidance that will likely result in an increase in second quarter or third quarter 2011, depending on whether we adopt -- on when we adopt it. I think adoption is required by third quarter. Early adoption is permitted in the second quarter. Essentially, what this means is that some loans that have come off of TDR status under the current RAP [regulatory accounting principles] basis of accounting will have to go back on when we adopt the standard, more like once a TDR, always a TDR.", "And then I'd also point out that about half of the TDR balance is on nonaccrual reporting because the financial condition isn't sufficiently strong to classify them as accrual loans yet. And importantly, of those that we have -- hold accruing, our re-default rate that we've experienced over recent quarters has been about 0.1%. So pretty much when we determine that a loan or TDR should go back to accrual status, we've made that call quite reasonably, continued to perform. ", "Now if we shift to capital. During the quarter as noted in the release, we issued a net of $25 million common equity through common shares. It's been our practice during the credit cycle that we place GAAP losses in dividends through the issuance of common equity. Given our positive earnings for the quarter, some of you may be wondering why we issued any capital and results.  The answer simply is that our own results beat our own internal forecast until very late in the quarter. ", "Capital ratios can be found on Page 9. The Tier 1 common ratio that's increasingly becoming a primary focus of capital planning improved by 32 basis points from the prior quarter to an estimated 9.27%. It's higher by about 30% from the prior year. And as you can see there, most of the other -- the other regulatory capital ratios improved even more than that, reflecting the sub debt that's converted into preferred during the quarter.", "A few other miscellaneous items related to noninterest income or noninterest expense. You'll note that securities impairment declined again to $3.1 million, down from about $12 million in the prior quarter. On a related note, you may notice that while the securities portfolio did not have a material impact on P&L this quarter, it did have an adverse impact on GAAP capital. On Page 6 of the release, you can see that we're now carrying the original AAA rated securities at an average of 59% of par compared to 68% at year end. This is primarily due to the fact that some of these securities have begun to trade at a level that bears factoring into our valuation model. We're still at Level 3, but we are incorporating some market-derived information in determining fair value based on some of the trades that we are observing that are non-distressed. Some of you know we've been saying that this day might come for nearly 2 years now. Well, that day kind of came this quarter, where we began to see enough trading as this market slowly begins to make that change. ", "We think this kind of step function change in the level of OCI is largely behind us, and we don't expect further significant declines in carrying value due to the increased trading. To the contrary as volume improves, we would expect to see liquidity discounts narrow. And indeed, the prices that we have been observing over the last few quarters, particularly in the higher rated tranches, have been trending upward. ", "And as a reminder for those building your models, assuming that we keep the total return swap in place, we will start incurring a quarterly expense of about $5.3 million for the TRS, starting in the third quarter of this year and then subsequent quarters thereafter as long as we keep it in place. And as noted in the release, other noninterest income, the very last line in that part of the table, includes $18.9 million of income from the FDIC that I previously discussed.", "Okay, moving on to noninterest expense. Salary and benefits did bump up by about $8 million compared to the prior quarter, that is the fourth quarter of last year. About $5 million of that difference was due to employee medical insurance costs. Last year through the year, we had accrued too much expense through the course of the year related to medical costs. And when we trued that up in the fourth quarter, there was a reversal of such expenses, which kind of artificially depressed that quarter's expense, while the first quarter expenses this year are more in line with normal levels. And also because we expect to be profitable for the year, we began to accrue modestly higher bonuses for various things than we have in the past couple of years.", "Provision for unfunded lending commitments was a negative $9.5 million. We realize this line has been quite volatile. It may be so and it may continue to be so for a while. But I would say that in general, the trend in that line should be about 0. Essentially, quarterly additions to new unfunded commitments would tend to drive that number pretty positive, while improving credit quality in existing commitments tend to drive it down. Wish I could give you more guidance than that, but I think it's going to basically bounce around 0 or maybe low positive single digits as a run rate.", "Other noninterest expense line contains $13.1 million of FDIC indemnification write-off, as assets have performed better than originally modeled. We picked up the offset to that up in the revenue lines, but we have to take expense to write off that indemnification asset if we don't think we're going to claim as much from the FDIC. Also absent in the first quarter of 2011 was any accrual for the AML related penalties that we announced early in the quarter, but which we accrued it in the third and fourth quarters of last year.", "Okay, shifting to guidance for the next few quarters. The balance sheet, we think the overall balance sheet will remain about flat for the remainder of 2011. We think the net shrinkage in the loan portfolio, which moderated a lot this quarter, will continue to moderate and possibly begin to grow. The demand for C&I, term CRE and to some extent consumer loans appear to be strengthening. And at the same time, we would expect the drag from continued construction and development loan runoff and from working down the FDIC-supported loans to begin to moderate. ", "Picking an inflection point from net decline to net growth is difficult to precisely predict. But I would expect ending loan balances at June 30 to be relatively flat to somewhat positive compared to March 31 balances.  Again, we would expect the core NIM to remain generally stable during the next couple of quarters. ", "Asset quality. We think the outlook is for continued improvement if the economy continues to show reasonable stability and modest improvement. We would expect charge-offs and provisions both to decline over the next several quarters, but not another step function decline like we experienced in the first quarter. We also think nonaccrual loans and classified and other adversely graded loans will continue to recede at a reasonably good pace.", "The tax rate is distorted by the taxes on the -- the tax impact of the sub debt conversions. Essentially, some of the sub debt conversion expense that we recognize each quarter when it occurs is tax-deductible, some is not. So conversion can drive that number around. But we would expect the tax rate to be between 37% and 39% for the year, but probably the second quarter rate will be around 50%, based on what I'm about to tell you. Today was the last date on which holders of 2 of the 3 sub debt issues could give notice of their intent to convert this quarter. And those are the only 2 that have that that right this quarter. The other one, as you know, converted. Had that right last quarter and will again in the third quarter, last quarter and first quarter. ", "So I'm talking about now that -- I'm about to tell you the sub debt amount that will convert in 2Q. It is based on preliminary information from the bond trustee at the close today. The sub debt amount converting will be about $138.5 million. That is up between $50 million and $60 million from this quarter. That would impact -- have a pretax impact, our first rough estimate is about $61.4 million on pretax earnings in the second quarter and about $50 million after-tax. That $50 million would compare to the $33.3 million impact first quarter. We will file or furnish, not sure technically which it will be, an 8-K with the final totals within a couple of days, but we wanted to give you that heads up since we know that information. ", "For those of you who are wondering why our earnings announcement didn't come out at 2:15 Mountain, but came out at 3:00 Mountain, 5:00 Eastern instead, we thought it only fair to not give people who are watching their screens that last 45 minutes to know those numbers. So we delayed to make it fair to everybody the earnings announcement, until the conversion election period was closed. So we didn't give you much time to digest the announcement, but I think it was in the interest of being fair to all investors.", "We also think that after second quarter, there's reason to believe that the amount of these conversions, and therefore, the attendant noise in our earnings release or earnings each quarter should substantially abate. Basic theory of the case is the arbitrage trade has been pretty strong the last few quarters. And if it wasn't strong enough to get you to convert already, what will it take to get you to convert in later quarters as you get closer to the call date for the preferred you're converting into? So it's a judgment call, but I would think that we're maybe getting through most of the noise after the second quarter. ", "With that, we will end the prepared remarks. And I have about a half hour left for questions. We'll give you a minute or 2 to queue them up and then start taking your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "The loan growth that you did have during the quarter, can you give us some more color geographically? Or any other color you think is pertinent and what you're seeing in demand out there? And are you participating more actively in the syndicated market these days?", "Doyle Arnold", "The loan growth was -- it broadened geographically. I think we saw either some combination of strengthening growth and/or strengthening pipelines just about everywhere. Maybe Southern Nevada would be an exception to that, although it's not declining as fast as it used to.  The economy there remains very weak. The biggest contributor, as it was last quarter, was Texas. And probably the biggest strengthening of the pipeline was in Texas. And as for syndicated loans, no, I don't believe that -- well, there's been some growth in syndicated lending, but I don't know how much.", "Kenneth Peterson", "Additional advances on existing syndicated loans in Texas in the energy sector.", "Doyle Arnold", "Did you catch that, Jennifer? That's Ken Peterson, our Chief Credit Officer.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you. I'll let others jump on. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Craig Siegenthaler here from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Well, given that you're profitable now really in all metrics, you're putting out commentary that you expect to be profitable the remainder of 2011, how are we supposed to think about TARP repayment now, really in terms of kind of timing and method? Are you still thinking about breaking up into tranches?", "H. Simmons", "I really don't have any additional guidance other than we've saying on that front. As I said before, we don't expect to start having serious discussions with the Fed until maybe later this quarter, probably third quarter. Still not totally opposed to breaking it up into tranches, but would like to get on with it. Our capital ratios, if you look at them, are across the board. It should be perceived as well within the comfort zone of what those who've been repaying TARP have done. But as always, the rules remain unwritten and undefinable until you actually have the discussions.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then just real quickly on the sub debt conversion speed here. How should we think about the pace of the 2005 sub debt conversion, 3Q versus kind of the first quarter if it's comparable? It sounds like from your commentary on the arbitrage opportunity, it sounds like it should actually decline in terms of the volume. Is that kind of your expectation here?", "H. Simmons", "I agree with your finish. You said something about 2005?", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "No, I said the 2015 sub debt. I believe that's the one that converts in the first and the third quarter seasonally.", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, I would think so. And again my argument, it's been a pretty strong pickup for the last 2 or 3 quarters now in the -- if you take the price at which the sub debt was trading and therefore, theoretically the price at which investors may have marked it, the preferred C has been at a 3 or 4-point premium to that. So by converting, you could pick up an immediate pop, and that trade has been there for a while now in all of the issues as they've come up. In addition, you get a 9.5% dividend instead of 5.5% to 6% dividend, although at the risk of trading down in the capital stack. Well, that trade's been so strong, if you haven't already done it, why would you do it in the third quarter or the fourth quarter? Particularly because every quarter that goes by, we get closer to the date at which the preferred C can be called by us. And so you run the risk of trading into something that gives you a higher yield for a little while, but not nearly as long as you'll get the interest on the debt. So that's the theory on the case. That's why I would expect it now to start to decline.", "James Abbott", "Craig, this is James. The present value of cash flows, by holding on to the subordinated debt, are higher now than if you were to convert into the preferred stock at this point. So that may be helpful.", "Doyle Arnold", "At least to James' discount rate. He can't speak for every hedge fund out there.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "That's assuming it's a longer period, right?", "Doyle Arnold", "It's a longer period, that's right. So I'm just using market rates, implied market rates on these discount rates to get that.", "H. Simmons", "Most of the stuff that's converted is converted in the preferred C, which is callable in mid-2013, whereas the debt maturities are in 2014 and '15, depending on the issue.", "Doyle Arnold", "Got it. All right, great. Thanks for my questions. I'll jump out here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "On the asset quality, which is tremendously better than I think our expectations are, you released -- what type of release, provision releases can we expect going forward? Is it going to be about the same we saw today? Or would it start to trend down?", "H. Simmons", "You mean as in get smaller, the releases?", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "The provision, yes, yes, yes. We know it's going to get smaller but by this same degree, I guess, is a better way to answer -- to ask the question.", "H. Simmons", "I would -- that's really hard to predict, because it's going to depend not only on what we know now, but information that we will develop over the course of the quarter, both in terms of how much additional classified and reductions we achieve and then what loss rate on those reductions. But I would think that the reserve release is not going to get smaller for the next quarter or 2. It's going to be -- continue probably at a similar pace and it might even be slightly higher.", "Doyle Arnold", "With the charge-offs falling as much as they did, that was a helpful factor in the reserve release. And then also, the classified loan balances dropped a little bit more than we expected. I think Ken, on the last conference call, estimated a drop between 5% and 10% and came in at the high end of that range. And so those are the 2 major driving factors.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "I know you guys had a big step factor. But are you seeing the same pace? Or is it supposed to have improvement so far this month? Or has it started to slow way down?", "H. Simmons", "Well, it's way too early -- you can't read much into the first month, even of a given quarter, because most of the action occurs in the third quarter of the month -- third month of the quarter, sorry. The fourth quarter was a really big quarter where we achieved a 30% or more reduction in classified loans without a big step up in charge-offs. We achieved another 10% reduction this quarter with a big step down in charge-offs. And if you read our description of our loan loss reserve methodology in the 10-K, the 2 big drivers are classified loans and the loss rate on classified loans. So if one's improving and one is stable to improving, it implies a further reduction in credit costs in quarters going forward.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Thank you very much, gentlemen.", "H. Simmons", "I want to come back just -- before we take the next question, I just want to come back to I think a comment Craig made about profits for the year. Yes, I did say we expect to be profitable for the year in my prepared remarks. I just want to point out that the $138 million of conversions and that cost will be a bigger cost than -- $50 million is bigger than last quarter. So we should be profitable comfortably so before preferred dividends and/or excluding sub debt costs for the second quarter. But that amount of conversion expense will make it tough to post a big profit in the second quarter. It might be more around breakeven, broadly speaking. But I didn't want -- in case anybody read into that profitability in the second quarter, that's a harder call to make, but then profitable for the year, which I'm quite comfortable with.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I want to ask Paul's question a little bit of a different way. If we just look at the pace of reserve reduction around $80 million, it would seem that it would take you, I don't know, at least another 2 years to get the reserve down to a more normal level. Wouldn't you need the charge-offs to pick up to consume the reserves you've already set up? Or do you expect to start taking negative provision the way we've seen some of your peer banks do it to get the reserve to a more normal level?", "H. Simmons", "I'm just curious, what are you calling a more normal level?", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I just put 2% on. It seems like a good level.", "H. Simmons", "It's hard to -- well, first of all, Steve, it's hard to know. It's not a secret, there's a lot of tension between what the regulators would like to have happen and what the GAAP, current GAAP methodology would allow in terms of what is a \"more normal reserve\". I think the regulators would probably like to cajole, push, find, get past needed change in a way that would achieve a normal reserve somewhat higher than that. So we're not necessarily predicating our thinking over the next 2 years on a 2%, but probably something a little higher than that. And the regulators don't like negative provisions. But you're right, there have been some. So could I, -- if we have this kind of improvement, could I see a quarter or 2 of close to 0 provision at least? Yes, I could. I don't know which quarter, but it is going to be hard to justify much of a provision in a couple of quarters going forward, if we continue to see: a. improvement in our own internal results, and b. continued reasonable stability in the economy. But those things will dictate the facts and circumstances at the end of each quarter on which we have to base this decision.", "Kenneth Peterson", "I think I'll just add to that. With respect to kind of the qualitative adjustments we make to the quantitative approach to this problem, the qualitative adjustments we're making are really probably the high end of the range of where we can comfortably go. And so if the economy continues to improve and we see lower charge-offs in the second quarter than we did in the first, which we think is going to be the case, you could see certainly see a little more release next quarter.", "James Abbott", "We have a follow-up question that came through email. I'm just going to let Doyle answer it while we're on the topic. The question is, is the outlook for 2011 profitability for the full year? Does that include sub debt conversion and TARP dividend?", "Doyle Arnold", "Yes, it does. As long as -- particularly as long as my forecast that the sub debt conversions are going to start to decline, or at least not go up. I mean it's really hard to see them going up any higher. I think out of this quarter now, roughly half or more of the total sub debt, I think over half of what could convert has converted as of second quarter. I think something like close to $700 million has converted and there was originally $1.2 billion that could. So it almost has to be less. And yes, that's factoring in all -- that's net earnings to common. That's preferred dividends, sub debt costs, et cetera.", "Kenneth Peterson", "I'll just note if you go to Page 17 of the release, the top of the page there, you get some better ideas of what that looks like, adjusted for when you see these sub debt conversions start to slow and come to an end.", "Doyle Arnold", "We have about $579 million worth of sub debt par value that is left to convert at this point.", "H. Simmons", "After the second quarter numbers.", "Doyle Arnold", "After the quarter numbers that we just gave you.", "H. Simmons", "And again, the original amount was about $1.2 billion.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erika Penala from Bank of America.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "My first question is on operating expenses. Just trying to back into what you were saying, if on a more normal quarterly run rate, does $410 million, $420 million sound fair?", "James Abbott", "Let me get back to that page of the earnings. Erika, what we referred to was the health care benefit expense as well as the compensation and salary benefit expense, which are all included in that 1 line item.", "Doyle Arnold", "The $215 million there -- I was commenting on the first line of under noninterest expense of $215 million. And then the very last line, the other, those are the 2 lines I commented on. And yes, I mean, that's probably -- I forgot. I'm drawing a blank now, James, on what was in the other.", "James Abbott", "FDIC indemnification.", "Doyle Arnold", "We have had good performance out of the FDIC, so we could continue to have a little bit of expense in there. But I'd also point out again, Erika, I think everybody's familiar with this. A few quarters ago, we tried also to break out some of the other clearly credit related costs. And those are the 3 lines, OREO expense, credit related expenses and the provision for unfunded. The $9.50 million bracketed on the unfunded lending is not sustainable. You ought to probably pencil in 0 as an ordinary run rate or small positive number. But OREO, you can you kind of see that other credit related expense may have already begun to drift down and clearly OREO expense seems to have drifted down. And we would expect both of those to continue to improve in future quarters as credit quality improves, if that helps you.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "I'll follow up with James offline. In terms of the -- I just wanted to clarify your comment on adopting the new SEC guidelines for TDRs. It sounds to me like the lion's share of what's in the TDR bucket is actually more permanent in nature in that it's A note and B note, it's an A note/B note structure. So even if you had to reclassify what was sent back to accrual, it doesn't actually impact reserving or the provisions going forward.", "Doyle Arnold", "That's probably fair. And going back to accrual isn't necessarily impacted by the SEC guidance. It simply says whether it's accruing or not. I mean, our historic practice more or less has been that a restructure debt, if it could support the contemplated payments, et cetera, and we would either put it on accruing status if the cash flow's been there all along to support that level or after six months of performance, put it on and it can eventually roll off of TDR status. Well now under the new guidances, I think we interpret it, it can never come off of TDR status until the loan is, at some future point, re-underwritten to then totally market terms, rates, conditions, et cetera, if and when that ever may be. So some things that in accordance with GAAP we have removed from TDR status over this quarter and last may have to go back on TDR status when we adopt this new SEC guidance. And going forward, we'll have this kind of incremental rolled up in TDRs because once in jail, always in jail. But it's not going to be big. And I think the important thing to focus on is that the accrual nonaccrual breakdown again, where we've called it accruing at TDR, the re-default rate is 0.1% over, I think, the last year or so, cumulative. So it's not -- you're right, it's not going -- whatever this SEC guidance is, starts out to have any impact on those lines will have no impact on our reserving.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Patten from Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Most of my questions have been asked. But can you give us any color in terms of the inflows and what you're seeing in terms of migration of downgrades? And what type of credits? And obviously it looks like the loss content's a lot less. So just any update you can give us there.", "H. Simmons", "James is flipping through our big binder here.", "James Abbott", "Yes. Inflows were down pretty nicely on the quarter, Bob. The overall nonaccrual inflows this quarter, about $337 million.", "Robert Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Yes, that was in the release.", "James Abbott", "And that's down from $371 million last quarter. We had about $8,000 worth of loans that had an increasing balance, pretty small....", "Robert Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "$8,000?", "James Abbott", "I'm sorry, $8 million. And then about $87 million of loans were changed to accrual status. About $131 million were paid off, and about $62 million paid down in some form or fashion. Then we had about $107 million of charge-offs just out of the nonaccrual camp, and then about $71 million of nonaccrual loans moved to the OREO bucket.", "H. Simmons", "I think probably the other commentary would be compared to where we were a year ago, the rate of inflows is down about 60% or 70%, I believe, on a quarterly basis. And it's very widespread. It's pretty much across all the geographies and loan types.", "Robert Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "And would it be safe to assume, and Harris can answer this one, the ATM is dead?", "H. Simmons", "Well, we're going to obviously have to, as we get further in the quarter and start to understand really what the quarter's going to look like, we're still committed to -- if we actually have a net loss to common to cover that. And so we'll see later in the quarter. I'm just going to hang on probably largely to what the reserve release looks like this quarter.", "Doyle Arnold", "I think it's is safe to say, it's not say d-e-a-d dead, but it's at least de minimis, d-e-m-i-n. We're partially done with that.", "Robert Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "I had a question on the OREO expense line. Does that include both kind of the operational costs as well as kind of updated appraisals? And just what was your experience with getting updated appraisals during the quarter?", "H. Simmons", "Well, yes, it does include both. I will note that we've actually kind of had, I think, improving results with OREO workouts in that we have resolved -- in the first quarter, we resolved more OREO in the first 90 days after putting it in the OREO. So any subsequent charge downs that occurred on those properties in that period went back against charge-offs, net loan charge-offs and there were a few million dollars of those. I don't have the number that otherwise would have been in OREO. I think in general, we're solving stuff a little quicker and probably on better terms. Ken, do you want to...", "Kenneth Peterson", "I'd also just note, I mean, we're seeing more frequently, we're actually seeing recoveries. We're seeing some gains on the sale of OREO, which we certainly hadn't been seeing much at all off of a year ago, but we're seeing that today.", "H. Simmons", "Yes, we had -- the OREO expense was reduced in the quarter by $5 million of recoveries. In other words, we sold it for more than we initially marked it down to when we put it into OREO.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Great. That's encouraging. And I also was curious, any update on kind of C&I pricing and kind of what your experience has been lately with that?", "Doyle Arnold", "Competition's getting more and more intense out there, and I don't know. Harris, do you want to...", "H. Simmons", "Well, I was pointing out to the group the other day, some of the pricing that we're seeing, with the kind of capital levels that everybody is carrying these days, it's really hard to do some simple math and figure out how you get any kind of return on equity that covers your cost of capital. We're talking about a deal that was LIBOR plus 90 or something like this. But everybody's scratching around, trying to find earning assets. And I think we continue to be in a period where there's a lot of competition for the really high quality credits. It's less so as you get into the middle market and down for a little bit.", "Doyle Arnold", "I would just add that based on preliminary, I mean, a LIBOR plus 90 would not be indicative of our portfolio.", "H. Simmons", "Exactly. I was really referring to pricing we saw on a deal that we were competing for. So I don't know how you make any real money doing that.", "Doyle Arnold", "We saw a few basis points of compression, maybe 20 basis points of overall compression, in the loan production on a linked quarter basis, Joe. That number's still being trued up and finalized. But that'll get you in the ballpark. So it wasn't massive pricing pressure.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay, fair enough. Great colors. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from more Marty Mosby from Guggenheim Partners.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "I wanted to reconcile, you started off of with a balance sheet forecast of being about flat as we go through the remainder of the year. But then we flipped over and we talked about the inflection point between the runoff loan portfolio and the growth portfolio. Such that you said as early as June you might be able to see that flip. So second quarter, you might be able to see the loan growth. So just want to make clear that we're talking about loan growth coming back even in this quarter relative to maybe offsetting it with some security down in the security portfolio for the balance sheet to remain flat.", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, no, it's really cash. You look at the amount of cash we have, it's $4.5 billion or so, of which the bulk of it is in the banks. So we're happy to replace Fed funds or Fed balances at 25 basis points with loans and not grow the balance sheet at all for a long time.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "We were just wanting to reconcile those two trends. And then lastly when I was there, we talked about the impact of the oil prices. And they really, with Texas and the exposure you had there, that you were actually benefiting from the recent trends. Do you still feel that way? And how would you highlight that?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, I think as I said, I think the strongest market for loan growth this quarter as well as last was in Texas and in C&I lending. And I think that's probably -- a chunk of that is directly attributable to increased oil drilling, oil service and related kind of natural gas kind of activities. So it is -- because we don't have a large consumer portfolio, at least if it doesn't get too out of hand, oil in the high double digits to low triple digits is probably a net benefit to us.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "And then a last follow-up would be we talked about deposit cost and we had a big repricing coming through in the first quarter. Did some of that lag into the second quarter? In other words as you average those costs -- we're talking about margin being relatively stable, could we see at least some more movement on the deposit side? And thanks for your comments.", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, I think the average reduction in the cost of the interest-bearing deposits has been coming down sort of mid single-digit basis points per quarter for several quarters. I'm not sure what the step down or whatever phrase you heard. I don't think we've ever talked about that, but that's kind of the impact. And yes, there's probably a little bit more of that to go as some term CDs re-price to current very low, low levels that were maybe at 1% to 2% the last time they renewed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe", "I know this is looking out a little bit into the future and I guess after TARP repayment, but when you think about the prefers that you have outstanding, what is your, I guess, ability and willingness? And how aggressive are you guys going to be at paying those down? And is there any reason that might actually stop you or that you might want to keep those and start paying them down?", "Doyle Arnold", "Yes, in our most recent IR deck, Ken, which was March 19, the Citi conference. I think that's probably still available on our website. We kind of laid out the various costs and call dates of the capital stack that's out there. We've got -- of course, we've got the TARP out there and then the series, the next callable issue is the Series E preferred, which I believe, has a base amount of about $150 million or something like that, but 11% coupon on it. That's callable in 2012, in June. The Series D is now a much larger amount. That's what most of the sub debt's been converting into, Series C, excuse me. That's a 9 1/2% rate and callable in '13. We certainly have that in mind and we've kind of laid out the potential earnings per share impact of those things. Of course, what we actually do will be dependent on market conditions and rates and whatnot at that time. ", "And I think it's safe to say that we could probably -- if we had to refinance all of it, we could refinance it at a same issue, but at a lower rate today than then, and we'll certainly be having that in mind as we get closer to those call dates.", "Ken Zerbe", "All things equal, should we make that assumption that if nothing else that you refinance it with similar debt, but lower rates? And best case, you repay it with cash on hand?", "Doyle Arnold", "Correct, that's our thinking.", "Ken Zerbe", "Perfect. All right, thank you.", "James Abbott", "I think that will have to take care of all the questions for now. There are a handful of people still in the queue, and I will get back to you as soon as we can off the call. We appreciate your time today. And if you have further questions, of course, please email me or give me a call at (801) 844-7637.

(NASDAQ:ZION) Q2 2011 Earnings Call July 18, 2011  5:30 PM ET", "Executives", "James Abbott - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & External Communications", "Kenneth Peterson - Chief Credit Officer and Executive Vice President", "Doyle Arnold - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "David Blackford - Executive Vice President, Chairman of California Bank & Trust, Chief Executive Officer of California Bank & Trust and President of California Bank & Trust", "H. Simmons - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Member of Executive Committee and Chairman of Zions First National Bank", "Analysts", "Todd Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "William Stulpin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Zions Bancorporation Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. This conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the time over to James Abbott. Please go ahead.", "James Abbott", "Good evening and thank you, Huey. We welcome to this conference call to discuss our second quarter 2011 earnings. ", "I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. ", "We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during the call. If you do not yet have a copy of the release, it is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]", "With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris?", "H. Simmons", "Thank you very much, James, and welcome to all of you. We wish you a good evening as you join us here. We are very pleased with the continuing progress that the company is making as we return it to full strength. The last couple of quarters have been very positive for us and bode well for what the rest of the year holds in store. ", "Our major driver this quarter's improvement in earnings was yet another strong improvement in credit quality metrics. In fact, it was probably the most broad improvement of credit trends that we've seen cycle to date.", "We experienced improvement in classified loans, in delinquencies, in nonaccrual loans, in inflows to accruals, in net charge-offs, loss severity rates, reserve coverage of problem credits and charge-off levels. So a lot of good progress continues on the credit front. We were also particularly encouraged to post a moderate increase in the loan portfolio, in balances outstanding, which we'd projected throughout the quarter at various investor conferences. ", "The various affiliate bank pipelines remain at healthy levels, and most of the banks expect to continue modest growth through the second half of the year. However, we're certainly cognizant of the recent softening in some of the macroeconomic indicators, which could temper loan growth. Macroeconomic trends within our footprint during the second quarter were similar to the national economy. Some of the national economy, slowed somewhat. Rental income for all the major property types improved in the majority of our markets. Cap rates continue to exhibit some of the promising trends that we've noticed during the last several months. Vacancy rates also improved across majority of our property types in our footprint. All of these factors should facilitate further problem credit resolution and improving loan growth as we go forward. ", "So with that brief overview, I'll ask Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly performance. Doyle?", "Doyle Arnold", "Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. ", "As noted in the press release, Page 1, we have posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $29 million or $0.16 per diluted common share for the quarter. As we've done previously, we also presented the earnings in a way that excludes a couple of noncash items related to the sub debt amortization and conversion into preferred stock; and the FDIC loan discount accretion, which we believe is useful to longer-term oriented investors, as we don't expect those 2 income expense items to be with us into perpetuity. ", "On that basis, earnings improved to $0.45 per share from $0.29 per share in the prior quarter. There are also a few small items that we can call noise that are in the numbers, but they net to a fairly immaterial number. For the rest of our agenda today, I'll highlight 4 key topics: Revenue, some additional detail on credit, capital and last, some housekeeping items for those of you trying to update your models. And in that vein, I will also then provide you with our current outlook. And then, we'll try to respond to questions.", "First of all, revenue drivers. As usual, spread income accounted for 3/4 of net revenue. On Page 12 of the release, you'll note that for the first time in several quarters, there was positive loan growth amounting to $279 million or about 0.8% sequentially, which compares favorably to what the industry average reports have been on the Fed H8 data of about 0.4%. ", "Our growth was driven primarily by relatively strong increase of nearly $300 million in the C&I category or about 3.2%, which also compares favorably to recent industry growth reports. We also had growth in residential mortgage up about $880 million or 5% sequentially. Other color on the C&I growth, much of it is a function of existing customers drawing on existing credit lines or requesting an increase in lines of credit. Commercial loan utilization rates increased to 36% from 34.8% last quarter, and that's in spite of a 2% larger commitment balance in the denominator. ", "While we're seeing some erosion of underwriting standards within the industry such as only getting partial guarantees instead of full guarantees or lengthening of tenure, the most common form of competition still's on the pricing side, and we are subject to those same pressures. They're there, but they did not seem to accelerate in the second quarter per se. Most of the pressure -- the real shift came earlier this year kind of 6 to 12 months ago. And as loans mature and are renewed at the current pricing levels, we are experiencing pricing pressures on renewals. ", "Construction loans declined $198 million sequentially. And only a minimal amount of that decline, of about $12 million, was due to loans moving from construction into term CRE. An additional $37 million of the decline related to net charge-offs on construction loans. But that $37 million compares to nearly $100 million in the second quarter a year ago and a total of nearly $600 million in dollars of charge-offs in 2009 in construction and development loans, so. There's been very good progress over time in reducing risk in that portfolio, and loss rates continue to decline. ", "One housekeeping item that I'll interject for those trying to track the subcomponents of loan balances, net, we reclassified approximately $156 million this quarter of term CRE loans to owner-occupied commercial loans, which if adjusted, results in a linked quarter term CRE increase of about $21 million, very modest. That same adjustment applied to owner-occupied loans drops the growth in that category to about $19 million, also very modest. So if that wasn't clear, we'll take questions or James will take your questions and I'll answer it. But net, $156 million of what had been term CRE last quarter got moved into owner-occupied, as we reinvestigated just what those loans were. ", "On Page 16, the GAAP net interest margin declined 14 basis points to 3.62% compared to 3.76% in the prior quarter. That's related entirely to the larger amount of sub debt that converted second quarter compared to first. The core NIM, which excludes the amortization effects of sub debt conversion and items related to FDIC loan outperformance, was quite stable. It was 4.07% compared to 4.06% in the prior quarter, and I believe that was consistent with our guidance throughout the quarter. So the adverse effect of the sub debt conversion amortization on the NIM was 53 basis points compared with 36 in the prior quarter. And note on the rates and yields chart the discount amortization impact shows up as the cost of long-term debt, which was 22.5% this quarter, even though the coupon on that debt ranges from 5.5% to 6%. ", "Finally, as has been the case for a while now, our balance sheet remains asset-sensitive. Under a scenario where interest rates were to rise 200 basis points in a parallel shift and assuming approximately $6 billion of noninterest-bearing or other low-cost deposits were replaced with market rate funding, we would expect to see about a 9% increase in net interest income. Our modeling shows that we are still asset-sensitive, but less so in various nonparallel shifts in the curve. ", "Shifting to credit, on Page 13 as Harris mentioned earlier in the call, virtually all of the major credit quality metrics improved when compared to the prior quarter. We had a couple of highlights that aren't not in the tables on Page 13 through 15 of the release. ", "First, inflows of new nonaccrual loans again declined. They were down 22% from the prior quarter to $263 million. Loss severity as measured by loss experienced in classified loans, or loss given classified status, continue to trend moderately lower for the portfolio overall. C&I loss severity improved the most for the second quarter in a row with owner-occupied following close behind. ", "The performance of classified and nonaccrual construction loans was quite strong this quarter. Classified residential construction loans declined 39% from the prior quarter, and nonaccrual residential construction loans fell 26%. Classified commercial construction loans declined 19%, and nonaccrual commercial construction loans declined 13%. Additionally, classified term CRE loans declined 12%, a strong improvement compared to the prior quarter's modest decline of only 2%. ", "The allowance for credit losses, which includes both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments, declined to $1.34 billion from $1.45 billion last quarter. Nevertheless, all of the coverage ratios strengthened relative to problem credits and loan losses. And in fact if you annualized the second quarter net charge-offs, the reserve now covers nearly about 3 years of charge-offs. ", "Quantitative factors declined significantly due to the aforementioned trend, namely, the reduction in both classified loans and the continued improvement in loss rates on classified loans. However, we increased the qualitative component of our loan loss reserve by about $35 million due to some of the clouds that formed on the horizon, namely things like European debt situation uncertainty over U.S. fiscal policy and a number of disappointing economic reports and forecast revisions during the quarter. ", "Let me touch briefly on troubled debt restructurings. As you know, there's new reporting guidance that comes into effect for the third quarter. We're currently reviewing all loans within the portfolio to see which ones may meet the new FASB guidelines for a TDR that weren't reported previously. We are not -- we have not completed that review, but we do expect a modest increase in TDRs as a result of the more broad criteria for whether a loan was renewed or restructured at a market rate, whether the loan was troubled, which was broadened to include the loans likely to become troubled within the foreseeable future. Again, though, we think that increase will be modest. And any increase in the TDRs will have no impact on our net charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses or provision expense. Thus, while change in accounting may be helpful to some, it will not fundamentally alter how we run the business or our outlook for profitability and earnings growth.", "Shifting now to capital. The tangible common equity ratio declined 6 basis points to 6.95%, entirely driven by the increase in deposit balances of nearly $600 million. Those are primarily noninterest bearing deposits, and this led to a nearly similar-sized increase in assets, with a majority of the increase going into cash and cash equivalents. ", "Another headwind of the TCE ratio is the sub debt conversion, wherein tangible common equity balances were reduced through the conversion process. And that direct impact on common just about offset, not quite, but largely offset the net earnings to common during the quarter. Tangible common equity relative to risk-weighted assets was steady in the prior quarter or compared to prior quarter. Tier 1 common ratio was unchanged at 9.32%. Other reg cap ratios were stable through very modestly stronger compared to prior quarters. ", "With regard to the bank trust preferred CDO portfolio and as it relates to capital, you'll notice on Page 5 of the release 2 changes in the carrying values of all 3 classification buckets. This was driven largely by an increase in trading volume in the markets for these securities, but also by a sale of some of the CDOs. First as trades occur, and in no way would we have classified the market as liquid, we nonetheless consider the pricing of such trades if they're non-distressed relative to our portfolio marks. This has been our practice for several quarters now. And last quarter, you may recall that there were more trades in the original AAA-rated securities, which caused us to reduce their carrying value last quarter. Additional trading in the original AAA-rated securities in the second quarter actually drove an increase in their value, taking that group up to 65% of par from 59% last quarter, more or less reversed the decline that we posted last quarter. ", "However, we observed this quarter a few non-distressed trades in the original A and BBB-rated securities that were somewhat comparable to ours. Consideration of these trading prices and valuation process led us to reduce our estimates of fair value for these junior tranches. In addition, we took advantage of the slight increase in liquidity to sell a handful of CDOs for a net loss of $4 million, or about 4% haircut to our amortized costs on those securities. This had the primary benefit of reducing classified assets, and it reduced the par value of our TruP CDOs by $185 million and amortized costs by $95 million, as noted in the text of the press release.", "I know many of you will have questions about the timing of TARP repayment, and let me address those in advance by saying I'm not going to address them. We note that we've achieved some important milestones or are well on the way of achieving them, as we've discussed previously. These include return to profitability, dramatically better credit quality ratios, stronger capital levels and enhanced operating practices. Beyond that, I'm simply going to refer you to previous guidance and we're not going to talk about TARP repayment. At that time when I said sometime in the second half of the year, we'd be sitting down with the Fed. I still think that's the case, and I would rather negotiate with them, not with you folks on the line, and not negotiate with them through comments in public. So that's about all there is to say about that. ", "Now a few other housekeeping items, noninterest income. Dividends and other investment income, you may have noticed jumped considerably. This was in part due to the reevaluation of an interest and in an equity investment. Well, we think the quarterly run rate on this item may be more or less $10 million in the near term, but again it will probably be somewhat volatile. But just to caution, you shouldn't extrapolate this quarter's revenue from that line into the future, maybe build off of something like $10 million in your model. ", "As a reminder, we do expect to incur a quarterly expense of $5.3 million for the total return swap on the CDOs this quarter. That has not been in the last three quarters, as you may recall. It will show up as a contra item within the fair value of non-hedge derivative income line. ", "Moving to noninterest expense. Salaries and benefits jumped by about $7 million, primarily due to bonus accruals. That's a function of recent better performance, absolutely and relative to budget. There's also about $4 million of expense that's more akin to onetime or temporary items that you probably would be advised not to annualize and grow. ", "Regarding FDIC premiums, the new formulas for computing premiums became effective this quarter. And as you note, that line item was about $15 million compared to about $25 million in each of the last several quarters. $15 million, we think, is the starting point for the run rate going forward. And the amount may decline somewhat over time, as some of our credit quality metrics and other things that drive the rather more complex calculation improve. Although if there's any asset growth, that may somewhat offset that, but let's see. ", "Our provision for unfunded lending commitments was negative $2 million compared to a negative $10 million in the prior quarter. Second quarter is more typical of the level we'd expect to see, assuming continued credit improvement and moderate growth in loan commitments. Credit improvement will improve it, loan growth will increase it. And so maybe somewhere around 0 should be your starting point for the near term. ", "Okay, more broad guidance for the next few quarters. Regarding the balance sheet, we expect the overall balance sheet size will remain about flat through 2011, or possibly grow modestly. If there's growth, it will be driven, as it was this quarter, by cash equivalent asset increases that result from deposit growth. As a base case, we expect the loan portfolio to continue to show flat to very modest growth over the medium term. Pipelines are healthy. Production volume increased somewhat in the past few months. But there's more uncertainty today compared to 3 months ago with regard to the impact of economic news. And in fact, loan balances were flat in the month of June and are more or less flat here in early July. So I wouldn't take the change from first quarter's decline in loans to this quarter's growth in loans and just build that delta in. I think it's going to be more modest than that. ", "With regard to the margin, we think the core NIM will remain generally stable during the next several quarters as it has been for the last several. Some modest pressure may arise if deposit growth continues at recent rates simply due to high ratio of incremental cash growth at very low yields compared to incremental loan growth. If loan growth does exceed deposit growth, we fully expect NIM expansion. ", "With regard to credit quality, notwithstanding the weaker economic news, we still expect charge-offs to continue to decline over the next couple of quarters. We expect nonaccrual loans and other adversely graded loans will continue to recede at a healthy pace. This is likely to result in very low provision expense in the second half of the year. But we will watch closely the economic environment and leading indicator developments, which may continue to pressure upward our qualitative adjustments to the reserve. ", "Tax rate, we would expect the rate to be between around 38% and 40% for the full year, which implies about a 36% rate for the second half of 2011. This assumes moderate amounts of sub debt conversion. If a large amount occurs, it would have the effect of raising the effective tax rate. ", "Regarding sub debt conversions, we expect to file an 8-K in mid-August regarding sub debt conversion amount for the third quarter. That's when we will know the amount that has been posted for conversion by the owners of the debt. It's difficult to predict the conversion amount in advance, as you know. However, we would note that the outstanding balance that can convert this quarter is only $247 million, roughly half the dollar amount that was able to convert in the second quarter. As the conversion amounts in the first and third quarters tend to be lower. And all else being equal, we would expect this one to be lower as well. I'd also note that the ARB spread, i.e., the pop that one could get from converting sub debt, if you marked it up to market to preferred, has been very low of late. In some cases, it's even been negative. And thus, one of the major incentives to convert has moderated substantially. ", "With that, I think we will give you a couple of minutes to queue up questions. And moderator, we'll turn it back to you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first questioner in queue is Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Regarding your TruPS CDO portfolio, I know you said the market is far from liquid. But obviously you are able to sell some into the market now. Can you just address your willingness or appetite to continue to sell the TruP CDOs as I guess the market permits?", "Doyle Arnold", "Very hard to predict. I think where we can -- clearly those are perceived and maybe actual source of risk on the balance sheet. And I think it's safe to say that we would -- we're continuing to look for opportunities to reduce risk on the balance sheet where it can be done at reasonable cost. So this is something we'll continue to look at. But I don't have a target amount or even a guidance amount. But it is something that we will continue to look at.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "I know it's hard to answer. The other question I had just in terms of the core NIM. Your guidance is stable for the next several quarters. Can you just talk about the drivers of how you get there? Obviously, your comments about competition such in C&I pricing that remains challenging, and that you're seeing some asset yield compression. Do you have enough deposit room? Or is there -- to reduce your deposit costs or are there other factors that we may consider in terms of how you get to stable core NIM?", "H. Simmons", "I think that the -- what was Chairman Mao's phrase, the correlation of forces, remains much as it has been in the prior quarters. If we have -- obviously, a buildup in cash balances is a depressing effect. Any loan growth is a positive effect. The decline in nonperforming assets is a positive effect. There's -- if you noticed, I think the decline in interest, in deposit cost of 4 basis points and the decline in loan yields of 4 basis points exactly offset each other this quarter. So we would expect that to be probably a continuation of that very small amount or change on both sides of the balance sheet in the next quarter or 2. James, you want to add anything to that or any major thing?", "James Abbott", "On core NIM, obviously, I think implicit in my remarks is the fact that we would expect the reported NIM to be quite a bit higher this quarter.", "H. Simmons", "I'll just jump in and say I think the pricing pressure we're seeing tends to be -- I don't think it's really across the board. It tends to be on larger, very high-quality kinds of deals. And so we're not seeing that kind of pricing stress uniformly. And It's clearly there on larger deals, less so on kind of small middle market credits.", "James Abbott", "This is James. I'll just interject that in terms of pricing, loan pricing on owner-occupied which is a core business for us of course, loan yield was about 5.6% on a incremental production basis. So we're still getting very, very healthy yields on a lot of the production. But in the larger corporate deals, to Harris' point, there is more pricing pressure there than in other areas. Although if you talk to lenders, they'll tell you that there's still pricing pressure even on the smallest deals.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue is Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.", "Todd Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Just want to follow up on your comments on the loan growth. You mentioned that a good portion of the growth this quarter came through existing customers. I'm just curious as I look at the 1- to 4-family portfolio, the energy portfolio and the SBAs within C&I, was there anything in the way of purchased loans that may have influenced the balances to any degree this quarter?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, I think the comment about existing customers was primarily targeted at C&I. I believe that's what I was referencing there. Clearly some of the home mortgages were new, et cetera. There were no major loan purchases. There were included in the C&I growth was on syndication or participations, but no portfolio purchases, would that be a fair way to describe it? Did I address your question?", "Todd Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Yes, that's very helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, I'm just curious given kind of the sluggishness in the economy and demand, for all intents and purposes remains fairly weak if you will, is the company in a position in terms of thinking about, perhaps alternative kind of asset purchases, other loan purchases to help improve the yield, or are you saying those kinds of transactions or deals being presented at this time?", "Doyle Arnold", "We do occasionally see distressed portfolios that we have looked at. we, by and large, decided to focus on further reductions in our own level of classified and other weaker quality assets. So we've not really gone there except in very one-off cases. And no, we're not considering any bulk purchases of other portfolios. We've seen a few here and there, but we're pretty determined to stick to customer relationship lending within our territory. And the portfolios that I've seen tend to be portfolios of leases that are nationwide or some other things that are nationwide where there's no relationship with a big chunk of the portfolio. And that's not the direction we're headed.", "Todd Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And that's consistent within the energy portfolio as well, correct?", "H. Simmons", "Yes.", "Doyle Arnold", "Yes. Is there a question behind that question?", "Todd Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "No, again just with the improving demand and again just kind of the Amegy's kind of historical lead role within those relationships that, given kind of the drivers within the energy sector and some of the volatility we've seen, whether or not there are other opportunities that have presented themselves outside of kind of your existing customer relationships.", "Doyle Arnold", "No, I mean, that's some of the -- when I mentioned syndications and participations, a lot of that would be at Amegy and it would -- a lot of that would be energy-related in one way or another. But it's not -- again it's not portfolio kinds of purchases and that's not something we're considering.", "H. Simmons", "In any case, we're selling pieces off. I mean, we're auctioning. So it's works both ways. But I think it's very consistent with what we've been before. And I'll also just say this point in the cycle, we're not getting antsy to go out and do anything particularly aggressive.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue is Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Doyle, I was just wondering if you can just expand upon at this point in the cycle, you're starting to see loan growth get a little bit better, and yet deposits are still really coming indoor at a great pace. Can you characterize where the deposits are coming from, new customers, existing customers, different parts of business? And what you expect to happen over time? Do you expect to see deposits get drawn as credit comes back? Because it still seems that we're just getting both. You're getting great amount of deposits and yet the loan growth is starting to come back.", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, the biggest amount of deposit growth remains in commercial noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, commercial checking accounts, as it has been for many, many quarters now. And there are -- as you know, treasury management is something that we have placed great emphasis on for a number of years now. So we do continue to add customers and shows up in increased customer accounts in those kinds of categories. But I think it's fair to say that the bulk of the increase in balances from existing customers who are just piling up more and more cash, it's very much related to the fact that I think there's no other investment alternative that reasonably safe where they can earn anything. They are -- the profitability has improved among a number of our customers. So they are generating cash and they appear to be reluctant to deploy it in the continued economic and policy uncertainty that's out there, probably things you've been reading about and hearing about from others. We are seeing a few businesses. I mean as well, we have seen better growth in C&I. We've also seen a smaller decline in -- I mean, some of the net growth is the fact that we've reduced the construction and development portfolio from a peak of, I think, over $8 billion 3.5 years ago to about $2.7 billion today. And you're beginning to get to a point where that's a little bit more of a steady state, with, in fact, I think our best guess is it's probably what's left, 2/3 of it, has been originated post-crisis in this new production, new projects that are in construction today. So I don't -- things are better. There's not doubt about it, but they don't feel like they're accelerating right now.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "My second question is can you walk us through in the circumstance that Deutsche Bank were to be downgraded, given what's going on across the pond would there be any ramification on the swaps? And how would that work, if so?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, we now have the right to renew or cancel the swap every quarter from here on out. We prepay the first year's worth and that was that. So it's $5.3 million roughly of pretax expense every quarter. And if for any reason we decide that Deutsche Bank's rating is not worth keeping them behind the total return swap, we can cancel it. The impact of canceling it would be roughly about a $4 billion increase in risk-weighted assets, which would be about a 10% increase in risk-weighted assets or I think a little over $40 billion. So you can kind of apply that to regulatory capital ratios, and they would adjust accordingly. David, you want to...", "David Blackford", "My only other comment would be we also -- and there are triggers, I won't go into details. But within the agreement, there are triggers wherein they would have to pledge collateral if they got downgraded to protect us if in fact that would happen. Those are the 2 issues, the one Doyle just talked about, the fact that we have the right to claim collateral under certain conditions.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue is Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Partners.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "I wanted to comment just go through the kind of core earnings exercise. But if we looked at the reported $0.16 and we adjust for the debt conversion, we're right around $0.50 per quarter now. We have Durbin coming up and swap expense coming online. But we got some loan growth and deposit growth. Hopefully that kind of hold that $0.50 in line. If we look at credit-related expenses, right about $35 million worth of foreclosure OREO kind of expenses that were on the income statement, how fast can we see some of those starting to move down?", "Doyle Arnold", "I think they've already moved down a bit, and we would expect them to continue to trend down. I don't have a forecast to give you. But there are -- most of those -- I think those 3 different lines that we break out for you on the income statement, the other real estate, the credit-related and the unfunded commitments. So I've already told you the unfunded commitments probably average around 0 to the loan portfolio growth becomes slightly positive. But it could be slightly negative for a while, i.e. a negative contra expense if credit quality continues to improve, which we think it will. OREO is, I mean, gosh, look at it. It's come down from $40 million to $45 million down to $120 million. I think that the general trends should be that it continues to come down, but I don't have a read on the pace. And maybe the other one that's a little bit stuck is the other credit-related expense. But even that, which is appraisals and other things like that, that should begin to decline as we get further down into the pile. You got anything else you want to say, Ken or James?", "Kenneth Peterson", "I would just add, Marty, that historically when property prices are rising 20% so take this with a grain of salt, but that other credit-related expense line item was about $2 million per quarter. So we probably won't go back to that level, but you could see it down into the single digits at some point down the line.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "And this is the first quarter that we really had a provision number close to 0, which would obviously be less than we would think. So we're getting a benefit from that. Kind of compare that to our kind of normal of $60 million per quarter, just as a rule of thumb. Maybe we're adding $0.20 into our number this quarter. Whereas, Doyle, when you mentioned the asset sensitivity, if you kind of run that through the numbers, you kind of offset that with a potential margin improvement once we get the rate rise. So the timing of the usually lower provision being matched with hopefully rates going up at some point, kind of how do you see those two things because in size they kind of match up with each other?", "Doyle Arnold", "Timing is everything as someone once said. The other thing I'll point out to you is that our cost of capital is rather high. The reported cost of sub debt is rather high. Once the sub debt conversions taper off, and I do think that's likely to happen, the cost of the remaining sub debt will begin to drop significantly back to just more normal amortization level. The coupon is 5.5% to 6%. We basically mark it to market at around $0.50 on the dollar. So the normal amortization would take that up to around 11% or 12%, but it's 22% this quarter because of conversions. Knock it down to 11% or 12%, you got a drag there. TARP dividends are $70 million after-tax annually.", "H. Simmons", "That's the cash expense.", "Doyle Arnold", "That's the cash expense. And there's a little bit of amortization of the, I guess, the equity component of it. And when you got some expense in preferred, that becomes callable middle of next year. So there, you can't just look at the expense items. You got to look at the capital and funding structure as well.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue is Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just wondered if you could talk a bit more about the type of growth you're seeing in Amegy's energy portfolio and the type of pricing or spreads you're getting on that, and kind of what expectation you have for the portfolio going forward.", "H. Simmons", "Well, it's been -- it hasn't been solely in energy. It reflects the fact the Texas economy is simply adding more jobs than any place else in the country. But certainly, a slug of it is energy-related as we've seen additional activity there. It's been both production, some service-related credits. Pricing has -- and this is just sort of anecdotal for me is I've looked at deals. Pricing is maybe a little tighter than it had been kind of a year ago. But we're still seeing reasonable pricing on the kinds of credits we're doing. I think we're also seeing, in selected areas, quality real estate opportunities, fully leased or almost fully leased office building. We have a construction loan there with a heavy credit tenant. And we're also seeing a little bit across the board in C&I. So the general Texas economy is resulting in opportunities and energy a little bit in real estate and C&I.", "Doyle Arnold", "For the person taking the transcript, that was Ken Peterson, our Chief Credit Officer speaking last there.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And I guess my follow-up would just be any other comments about any of the other regions and some of the growth trends you're seeing or lack of growth. And also you'd talked in past or this quarter, you were expecting to see less in the way of CRE paydowns into that play out.", "H. Simmons", "I just note, we said 6, 9 months ago that we were likely to see some increased focus on 1- to 4-family residential here, and you see some of that in our numbers. We simply think that there's been some opportunities there with prices having come off and a lot of other lenders who've had heavier doses of that, probably less aggressive than they've been in some other product categories. So we've added there, incrementally, I'd say just about economies in some of the states, I mean, the Utah economy, because this is still large part of our business in Utah, Idaho. The economy here continues to improve. The unemployment rate is now down. I think it's roughly 7%. We're seeing reasonable job growth here. And a lot of -- we have seen a lot of corporate location announcements. I think the sort of the sentiment here is reasonably, this is pretty positive about what the next 2 or 3 years might hold in terms of growth in the Utah economy. California, probably, we all read about California. There are challenges there, and probably will be for the next 2 or 3, 4 years. Talked about Texas. Arizona, Nevada, they're going to be slow for a while. And we are seeing some commercial loan growth in Arizona and we're going to focus on that. We're seeing some, some -- and their volumes have been recently stable for the last year as a result, in part, of a little better commercial loan growth there. So kind of spotty. Texas really has been best driver of loan growth. Utah is looking like it could kind of chip in, in the second half. Other places still probably kind of...", "Doyle Arnold", "I think, the other comment, I think is that I don't think there's any place in the company where we're continuing to see just dramatic declines at this point. The worst case is about flat.", "H. Simmons", "Flat in Nevada.", "Doyle Arnold", "In Nevada, maybe still a little bit of decline there, particularly outside the residential 1- to 4-families that they've done there in the last couple of quarters. At the other end of the spectrum, Texas, as Harris said, has the strongest economy followed by the intermountain west.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue is Chris Stulpin with Raymond James.", "William Stulpin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Within loans, do you have a runoff amount for this quarter and the last quarter as well?

You mean the...", "William Stulpin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "I guess last quarter's balance, maybe when you add in production then you see where this quarter came out. I'm basically trying to see what the difference is.", "Doyle Arnold", "Broadly speaking, most of the loan officers that we've -- that I talked to have suggested that there has not been an increase in the prepayment speed. The production volume for the quarter was a few hundred million higher, about $400 million or so higher than it was last quarter and you saw the loan growth. So that also would be another way of triangulating the fact that prepayment speeds haven't changed a lot. if you look at or you can't, we have our internal portfolios to talk about. Look at the PPR speed of various different assets, and those did not change at all really compared to the prior quarters. Not much change in payoffs, paydown rates, but a little bit -- it's about actually about a 20% increase in production volume this quarter compared to the prior quarter.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue is Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Maybe first on the loan growth, Doyle. Could you break out the dollar amount of loan growth that came from the energy book in the second quarter? And then maybe talk about the types of mortgages that you held that drove the 1- to 4-family. Are these fixed-rate mortgages?", "Doyle Arnold", "James is looking up the first part. I'll start on the second part of your question. The mortgage growth came in California, Texas, Colorado. And I think the fourth state was ...", "Kenneth Peterson", "It was Nevada.", "Doyle Arnold", "It was Nevada, yes. And none of it's, with the exception a little bit of Nevada, it's all variable rate. In California, it's jumbos. We're finding good opportunities for relationship lending there. I mean in general, we've just found the pricing to be acceptable and the relationship opportunity's good.

Simmons", "Let's see how that compares to the prior quarter, I think.", "James Abbott", "Well, the prior quarter's $1.6 billion in total.", "Doyle Arnold", "But the growth, is it accelerating?", "James Abbott", "Oh, I have to catch with that.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Maybe just as a follow-up on the margin because you're guiding to a stable core NIM. But with the cost of interest-bearing deposits at 51, how much lower can that realistically go? And should we assume that you assume no negative impact from the reappeal of Reg Q?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, it's been coming -- the cost of interest-bearing deposits has continued to drift down 3, 4 basis points a quarter. And part of that is just the fact that some of the growth is not in CDs, but it's in very low cost savings accounts where we're paying 5, 10 basis points, what have you. So I do think there's probably room for a little continued drift down. We're not going to be -- I think it's fair to say we're not big enough to be the market leader on whatever happens on Reg Q. So I don't have a firm hand on what that might be.

One of the comments from a lender, actually it was a group call that I had very recently with a bunch of other lenders. And they said the small business owner is a lot of times relies on their personal equity to expand the business to some degree. And those equity levels have taken a hit, And so they are still rebuilding themselves. So we're not seeing a tremendous amount of growth out of that.

Your classified loans are down almost 50% year-over-year. Maybe I guess, I know that you guys kind of guided, Doyle, to provisions being low in the second half of the year.

I mean, should we expect another 2 quarters of $1 million provision, or maybe just give us some kind of -- what does your crystal ball say is a more realistic level or normalized level, if you will, of provision?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, what's your crystal ball say is the economic unemployment rate and what not in the -- It's hard to say. Again, I'd say -- I kind of made a comment about the economy only somewhat facetiously because as I noted, we did increase the amount of reserves, that it was driven purely qualitatively by the deteriorating economic outlook as opposed to what we can see in our portfolio based on the historic metrics. Had we not done that, we would have had a negative provision of $35 million, $50 million this quarter. So it's going to be low. I'm not trying to telegraph a negative provision.

And they're very open and transparent that they want an expected loss model like IASB, whatever it is has proposed, that they want the reserve to be more countercyclical. But that's not U.S. GAAP today, and we're caught on the horns of that dilemma as well. But we probably like to see that less volatility in that number as well.

And I assume that's what you're talking about since I wouldn't characterize Texas and Colorado as being distressed markets. We just -- there's just not a lot of people active in the nonconforming jumbo space. And so we're finding good opportunities in California to put on that kind of product. And yes, it's mostly 5 and 7/1 ARM and it's prime product.", "James Abbott", "We'd continue -- as some of the other portfolios have flattened out in the month of June. Residential mortgage grew, but at a very, very slight rate during the month. So it continues to grow a little bit in a couple of July here so. But I would emphasize that it's very slight.", "Operator", "Final question comes from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Most of my questions have been answered, but I do have a question about the deposits. If we're not really seeing a lot of loan growth, I mean, why continued growing loan deposits? Why not lower your deposits? A couple of guys have brought this up, but why not push those deposits out the door because you really don't need them?", "Doyle Arnold", "How do you propose that we push deposits out the door when the growth is primarily balances in DDA accounts for current customers? I don't really want to tell the customers to get the heck out of dodge.", "H. Simmons", "I mean, we're trying to do that with pricing, clearly, but we're also really trying to manage the place for the long term. And 3 years ago, you would have killed for liquidity. We expect 3 years from now, we might be in the same position again. So the focus is really on making sure that we're holding on to what we view as long-term, core profitable relationship accounts. And sometimes you have to be competitive to hold on to those kinds of accounts. But you want to be in longer-term what you're thinking about it right now. Just in the same way that you could go out and put on a lot of securities, for example, that opportunistically might look great right now, then they look awful years from now. And so we're really trying to think about what does the place look like in terms of years from now.", "Doyle Arnold", "It's a difficult -- it's a high-class, but difficult problem because it is painful in the short term. We certainly acknowledge that. But as Harris said, we are managing towards the belief that this current set of conditions will not continue indefinitely.", "Kenneth Peterson", "I'll just comment that you need to remember that the unlimited insurance and checking accounts goes away on January 1, 2013. We're not making forecasts here, but I strongly believe that in January 1, 2013 when this insurance goes away, we won't have $14.4 billion of noninterest-bearing checking accounts.", "James Abbott", "That will have to be our last question for today. We've jot down the names of those left in the queue, and I will do the best I can to get back to you tonight. It may be late, but I will make the effort. Thank you again all for your time and your work today to look at our company, and we appreciate it. We will be in touch with you shortly.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And now, I would like to introduce your host for today, James Abbott.", "James R. Abbott", "Good evening, and thanks, John. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2011 earnings. I would like to remind you that during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. If you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will limit the length of the call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]", "I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris?", "H. H. Simmons", "Thanks very much, James, and pardon my voice, I'm catching a cold here. So we're pleased to have all of you to be joining us on the call. ", "Overall, we're actually quite encouraged by the considerable progress on asset quality improvement made during the quarter. We believe this progress is likely to continue despite some of the weaker global and national economic indicators that we saw in the late summer. ", "One of the internal indicators that is particularly encouraging to me is the inflows into classified loans. Those inflows dropped 20% from the prior quarter's rate, continuing a trend that we've seen for a number of quarters now. ", "We also had a somewhat higher resolution rate of nonperforming assets compared to prior quarters, having results more than 27% of our nonperforming assets. The resolutions continued to be strongly skewed to favorable revolutions. About 3/4 of all resolutions or upgrades paydowns, payoffs, et cetera, as opposed to only about 1/4 of the resolutions resulting in loss. We believe that these trends will continue and problem credits and credit losses will continue to decline in the fourth quarter. ", "I know many of you are closely watching revenue trends, and we're happy to report that our core net interest income was generally stable at about $1.9 billion annually. The results exceeded consensus expectations on this front despite a modest decline in loan balances. We continue to work towards the goal of generating moderate loan growth, but we are also working to strike a careful balance with the pricing we use to achieve such growth. ", "We also continue to reduce risk by reducing select loan types, particularly acquisition and development loans. Most of the compression in the core net interest margin during the quarter was due to an accumulation of cash balances. We saw some quite strong deposit growth during the quarter. With a moderate amount of loan growth that we are targeting the next few quarters, we believe the core net interest income should remain relatively stable, although the margin may experience a very modest amount of compression if cash balances continue to climb. ", "Also, with regard to Operation Twist, we would expect a very moderate decline in net interest income over a one-year horizon. I'll let Doyle elaborate further on that point in a few minutes here. ", "With that overview, I'll ask Doyle Arnold, our Vice Chairman and CFO, to review the quarterly performance.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thank you, Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. As noted in the press release, we posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $65.2 million or $0.35 per diluted common share for the third quarter. As we've done in the past, we also presented the earnings in a way that excludes the noncash impact of the sub debt conversion amortization, as well as the -- which is negative on earnings, as well as the FDIC loan-to-discount accretion, which is a positive. We believe this is more useful to longer term-oriented investors, as we do not expect those income expense from items to be with us into perpetuity.  ", "On that basis, the earnings declined to $0.40 per share from about $0.45 per share last quarter. Most of that difference is due to the higher provision for loan losses made in the third quarter, which we'll discuss a bit more in a minute. ", "So let me quickly hit on some of the drivers of those earnings, and then we'll take your questions. ", "On Page 13, you can see that the credit trends, as Harris mentioned, were quite favorable across almost all loan categories. Despite meaningfully lower classified loans, nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs, we did, however, make a provision of $14.6 million, up from just $1.3 million in the prior quarter. ", "As many of you know, banks' loan loss reserving methodology, including ours, generally starts with a qualitative calculation that drives the majority of the allowance and then takes into account certain qualitative factors. These factors reflect management's judgment about various risks that may not be captured in the quantitative models. And one of our such qualitative factors is one for national economic conditions. In each quarter this year, we have increased that factor, most recently because of the sovereign debt situation in Europe, the impact that it could have to various feedback loops on the U.S., as well as a number of U.S. economic indicators kind of released during the August and September time frames that were weaker than economists had expected. ", "Year-to-date, these increases in the national economic adjustment factors have added more than $100 million to the allowance for loan losses. And in the third quarter, that increase related to the national economic conditions factor. It was $35 million more when compared to the second quarter. So absent that, all else being equal, we would have a negative provision of about $20 million during the quarter. But as we'll discuss, we're still just remaining a bit cautious about the outlook. But I do need to reiterate though that we're not seeing anything in those kind of reports that is yet feeding back to our own credit quality. We've spent much time in recent weeks with our lending teams reviewing existing problem credits and potential resolution in trying to understand if they're seeing any changes in behavior by their customers that would indicate that these global or national concerns are hitting the actual financials of our customers. And generally, we have not found indications that we're about to experience any newfound deterioration of the credit portfolio. ", "Rather, we still have a reasonable degree of confidence that credit quality trends for, at least, the next couple of quarters will continue to show improvement. In short, all signs within our own portfolio point to favorable developments. But this -- the national economic condition is less than crystal clear, and it's -- we think it's important to be vigilant and exercise caution with regard to the allowance. ", "Harris mentioned classified inflows or classified loan inflows, which fell to $357 million in new classified loans, down from $447 million in the prior quarter and from $537 million a year ago. Nonaccrual inflows also declined again, down 11% from the prior quarter to $233 million, and it declined 45% year-over-year. ", "Loss severity, which we measure as loss given classified status, actually averaged slightly lower for the portfolio overall, about -- for the 3 months, about 5.4% of classified loans versus 6.1% in the prior quarter. ", "Residential construction and development loans actually experienced the most meaningful decline, with loss rates now running lower than C&I. Term CRE severity also improved meaningfully and national real estate portfolio, while recovering, does continue to lag the rest of the portfolio in the rate of improvement. ", "There's been a lot of discussion in recent quarters about troubled debt restructuring. A slight increase in this quarter compared to the prior quarter was due to the change in the accounting guidance, which as mentioned in the release, led to a very small increase in TDRs, which was consistent with our guidance in July. Importantly, those we've placed on accrual status, the redefault rate remains extremely low. ", "Now if we shift to revenue on Page 12 of the release, there's a table of loan balances by type. We experienced,again, pretty healthy growth in C&I loans, up 2.2% sequentially. These loans are priced, on average, relatively neutral through our overall NIM. Line utilization rates declined moderately to 35.1% from 36%. But this was basically due entirely to increases in credit lines outstanding, not to large net paydowns. ", "Also, consumer loans increased about 1.5% sequentially, driven primarily by 1-to-4 family residential mortgages, which, for us, are predominantly 5-1 jumbo ARMs, and also with solid spreads to -- relative to incremental funding costs. Despite these gains, we had continued strong runoff in the construction and development portfolio, which was down $280 million or 10% sequentially. ", "A portion of this, about $54 million, was due to conversions to term CRE, and a very small amount, about $17 million, was due to net charge-offs. The large majority are either paid off or paid down. And while new production in line -- draws on lines in, this category remained muted. ", "On Page 16, with regard to the net interest margin, we detailed the NIM changes fairly well on the release. But to summarize, deposit flows particularly into demand deposit accounts remained quite strong during the quarter, while average loans declined slightly, netting to an increase in average cash balances of more than $700 million. Thus, the mix shift in earning assets was the primary reason for the decline with the core NIM. ", "The GAAP NIM expanded because of a much smaller amount of conversions of subordinated debt in the preferred stock in the third quarter. And if you missed our 8-K last week regarding the conversions of sub debt in the fourth quarter, we've added a brief summary in the earnings release indicating that the expected NIM and earnings impact from conversions in the fourth quarter would also be minimal, I think, about $0.025 a share after tax on the $15 million of sub debt that has given us notice that it will convert in a conversion notice made this past, so that's the number for the fourth quarter. ", "Finally, talk about the interest rate risk positioning of the balance sheet. The balance sheet remains quite asset-sensitive. Although we believe there's maybe some misperception among some in the market that the lower long end of the rate curve under Operation Twist is bad for us, we do not believe this will be the case. ", "Zions' earning assets are largely tied to the shorter end of the curve. The duration of our securities portfolio is about one year. We've specifically avoided buying mortgage-backed securities and avoided the payment through the payment -- paying premiums that amortize overnight when prepayments accelerate. So we don't -- we simply don't have a material amount of this risk and we have the lowest exposure, as a percent of our balance sheet, to mortgage-backed securities of all regional banks. ", "And of our loans, about 53% reset or mature within one year, and another 33% approximately reset or mature between 1 and 5 years, which leaves 13% to have a reset maturity beyond 5 years. We invest -- we estimate that the duration on the whole loan portfolio is approximately 1.3 years. ", "With such characteristics locked in the long end of the yield curve, it's not likely to be terribly impactful. In fact, we ran a scenario, an interest rate risk scenario, in which we used the recent lower end of the yield curve throughout the 10-year treasury and related swap rates down to 1.5%. About 70 basis points flatter than what -- or last time I looked, the 10-year treasury is around 2.2%. So that's about 70 bps lighter, which is -- reflects our interpretation of what Operation Twist, if successful, is designed to do. ", "On a static balance sheet, this scenario resulted in a reduction in net interest income of less than 1% over a one-year horizon. So that kind of quantifies what Harris said earlier, it was moderate or modest, I forgot the exact word. So hopefully, that will help provide some clarity on that issue for you. ", "Brief discussion of capital and some of the drivers of capital. Our GAAP tangible common equity ratio declined modestly to 6.90% from 6.95% in the prior quarter, and therefore, the tangible common equity per share also declined slightly. These declines took place despite the positive earnings because of the change in accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI, which is primarily related to our bank TruP CDO portfolio. ", "I'm going try to walk you through several impacts of what we saw related to credit spreads in the CDO portfolio and whatnot during the quarter, try to give you a better understanding. ", "The fundamental credit quality metrics in this portfolio actually showed continued improvement during the quarter. And no banks in our exposure group failed that we had not previously modeled at or near 100% probability of default. ", "Also during the quarter, we saw more banks prepay their trust preferred securities. That is banks whose trust preferred securities were in our CDO pools, more of them redeemed them, paid them off early for cash. And more deferring banks with, i.e., banks that had not been paying their dividends for the past number of quarters, resumed payment of trust preferred dividends. ", "This -- fundamentally, this is good. This phenomenon accounts for the -- it's reflected in the $13 million of fixed income securities gains that you see on the income statement. We actually got a cash paydown on a CDO security that we had previously written down through income, not through AOCI, several years ago when we bought it out of Lockhart's securities, and we got cash paydown and took a gain related to that. So that's just the -- that's one illustration that we had a lot of other observations of not the -- that TruP -- the CDO's prepaying, but the banks within the CDOs prepaying. ", "However, as we highlighted on the first page of the release, AOCI declined $84 million to a negative $589 million from a negative $504 million in the prior quarter. Well, why is this? This is due to the widening of credit spreads, as the quarter saw predominantly a shift to the risk off trade with all the uncertainty in, again, in Europe with the sovereign debt situation. So that widening of credit spreads leads to a higher discount rate on the future cash flows. ", "At the same time, we increased our prepayment assumptions for the bank and insurance CDOs based on the recent evidence of more prepayments and whatnot. And that, paradoxically, resulted in additional other than temporary impairment because the increased redemptions improves the position of the senior tranches because they get that cash immediately, but it withdraws cash from the junior tranches and makes it less likely that they will recover everything. So it leads to OTTI. But we also -- but the negative mark on AOCI would have been worse but for that increasing prepayments, which partly offsets the impact of the wider credit spreads. ", "If I haven't confused you on that, we'll try to --  we'll save the rest for follow-up questions. Fundamentally, we're pleased with the underlying credit quality of the banks in the CDOs, but discount rates still are quite volatile as news comes and goes out of Europe primarily. ", "Looking at regulatory capital ratios, Tier 1 common improved to 9.49% from 9.36%. At least that ratio is not impacted by the AOCI change, and other regulatory capital ratios also showed continued improvement. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio fully phased in is approximately 7.9%, and that's also been trending upward from when we first started disclosing that number. ", "Finally, just to let you know that we've begun to receive a return of some of the capital from our subsidiary banks that we pushed down to them during the crisis. It's modest, so far, but over time, will add up. Two of our banks, Amegy Bank in Texas and California Bank & Trust, resumed payment of dividends on preferred and common stock to the parent during the third quarter. And last week, Nevada State Bank paid $100 million of cash to the parent to redeem some of the preferred stock that it had previously issued to the parent 2 or 3 years ago during the crisis. ", "Guidance for the next few quarters. Balance sheet, we expect loan balances to continue to be flat to modestly growing in the medium term, with growth in C&I and consumer lending being, at least, partially offset by reductions in CRE and FDIC-assisted loans. Through the first few weeks of the quarter -- of the fourth quarter, net loan balance are demonstrating modest growth on the net basis, and pipelines and production rates generally remain healthy. ", "Then the credit quality, we expect continued improving trend in charge-offs, nonperforming assets, classified loans, potentially all measures of credit quality over the next few quarters. One question that often arises is what's your long-term allowances as a percent of loans? First, we don't target a ratio, but we work constantly of refining our models, both the quantitative and the qualitative. That said, with the quantity of problem loans still quite high relative to our long-term average, we do expect the ratio to continue to fall as classified loans decline. ", "Should there be a negative provision for the company as a whole at some point, perhaps we've actually had negative provisions in several of our banks at different times during the quarter. But it's probably more likely that we'll continue to experience minimal provisions, coupled with a modest amount of loan growth during the next couple of quarters. ", "Net interest income, in the NIM, we expect the core net interest income to increase modestly, and we expect core NIM to remain generally stable during the next several quarters. Two potential caveats to that: If deposit inflows continue to remain strong, driving the loan-to-deposit ratio lower, then the NIM could experience a bit of compression although net interest income would still should experience growth. And secondly, if loan growth really accelerates, we would expect NIM expansion. ", "With regard to fee income, excluding usual volatile items such as gains on securities, fair value impairment losses and securities, we expect core fee income to decline about $5 million to $7 million in the fourth quarter due to the impact of the Durbin Amendment, which may be partially offset by additional deposit service charges. ", "If we continue to see additional pickup in the rate of trust preferred redemptions by banks in our collateral business, that could lead to continued low levels of OTTI, but it would also tend to reduce a larger amount, the negative AOCI and its intended impact on tangible common equity. ", "And finally, we think the tax rate in the fourth quarter should be similar to the third quarter. The primary reason for the fluctuation of the tax rate over the last year is due to the varying amounts of sub debt conversion. It was about half of the sub debt amortization expense is nondeductible for tax purposes, and with fewer, much lower rates of conversion, we would expect much less volatility in that rate. ", "So with that, we will conclude the opening remarks and invite you to queue up your questions, and we'll try to address as many of them as we can in the remaining half hour or so.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Doyle, can you just talk about the cash position that you have? Obviously, it continues to increase. What's your, I guess, ability and willingness to redeploy any of that cash into something a little higher-yielding? And do you really make -- do you also make any assumptions about redeployment of that cash in your guidance for core NIM?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We have a total, as you saw, well over $5 billion of cash. We have roughly $1 billion of that is unencumbered cash at the parent. We're kind of building up that cash to -- for TARP prepayment at some point. So there's no plans to redeploy that into anything long term. It will continue to be parked at the Fed or invested very short-term. With regard to the remainder of the cash at the banks, kind of different reason, but same story. We're very, very wary of reaching very far out the yield curve when rates are at absolutely historic lows, and the tendency on anything within a yield would be for price to go down as soon as rates go up a little bit and potentially for duration to extend as well. So we know it's a short-term, and maybe even a medium-term drag, it's probably going to take a while to work that off. We do model, and we've disclosed this in our 10-Q, that we assume the possibility that several billion dollars of that cash could go away when the unlimited FDIC deposit insurance on transaction accounts goes away at the end of 2012. The vast majority of that cash balance is a build-up in cash, in checking accounts, of existing business customers. And at some point, they will redeploy that cash for us. We don't expect, either in their own businesses or something, I mean, it's very unusual for businesses to be sitting on that much cash. But they're not reinvesting either at the moment. But when they do, we expect a couple of things will happen, loan growth will pick up, and some of that cash will begin to drain away. So we're not going to lock it up in securities, mortgage-backed or otherwise, with long durations in this interest rate environment.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm assuming the second part of your question that you do not make any assumption about that in your NIM guidance?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No. I mean, we only -- it's basically predicated. While I said, if the cash balance stays roughly stable, probably the NIM stays roughly stable, if cash builds up, that may further depress the NIM, but not necessarily net interest income.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Understood, okay. And then just to follow-up, you mentioned TARP. Would you like to comment on any of your discussions or at least your current thoughts on TARP prepayment?", "H. H. Simmons", "Not really, but I think the -- I mean, the basic situation is that we've -- the Fed is reviewing intensely all of our capital and stress-testing models, and they've been doing that for some time. We've not seen any -- or we gave it to them kind of mid-third quarter. We've not heard any feedback that I would characterize as a showstopper, but neither have they completed their review. So -- and they may not, until late enough in this quarter or beyond, that there's -- it's kind of you ran out of your time with holidays and whatnot to do much. On the other hand, particularly kind of with the August, September state of bad news and uncertainty, we were not pressing that issue either to give back a whole lot of capital until the economic situation becomes a little clearer. So no, I don't have any definitive timetable, but I haven't seen any showstoppers, but we're not in a big hurry right now.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill.", "R. Scott Siefers", "Doyle, I wonder if you could just speak generally about overall interest rate positioning? I mean, you guys obviously are one of the most naturally asset-sensitive names out there. But I guess just given the duration that the short end of the curve is likely to stay low, any change in the way you'll keep positioning yourselves? In other words, can you kind of lessen your asset sensitivity? Or do you stick with the same kind of philosophy that you've had?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, again, I mean, to lessen the asset sensitivity would involve primarily lengthening the duration of assets, which would be fraught with danger right now. It's tempting to reach for any bit of the yield that you can, but any material impact would come with quite a bit of additional risk. I would just point out because of the characteristics of our balance sheet and the fact that our asset duration is so short, the short end of the curve has been pretty low for a long time. We've been living -- we've been fighting this battle for 2 or 3 years now, and doing so reasonably successfully, I would argue. And we've -- in a way, we positioned ourselves by design or by luck away from the adverse impact of an Operation Twist. And with Operation Twist under way, we're certainly not now going to go out there and lengthen duration, because someday, Operation Twist will go away.", "H. H. Simmons", "With Twist, we have a good output?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes. And it will be quite a twist. Harris or David, do you want to comment?", "H. H. Simmons", "I just comment on that all. I'll just add that I think one of the great strengths of the company is the fact that we've been able to achieve consistently strong margins relative to a lot of peers without engaging in a lot of kind of carry trade activity. And that's now it's going to, I thinks show itself over the next few quarters because some institutions are going to be in a lot of pressure from a lot of mortgage refinancing that's taking place. We simply don't have that kind of exposure, and that's what's the benefit that comes from not engaging in too much of that game in the first place. I think that it's something we've been pretty committed to for a very long time. And I don't see it changing right now.", "R. Scott Siefers", "Okay, that's helpful. And then I want to ask one additional question. Harris, a few weeks ago, you've made a comment about, I think, it's sort of pulling back in Texas given the competitive dynamic. And you mentioned in the release some of the pressures on pricing, at, I think you said, at the large corporate level. I wonder if you could just kind of expand on your thoughts and sort of update any of the stuff that you're seeing from a competitive dynamic standpoint?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I guess, I think it wouldn't be too different from what we talked last time. I mean, we are growing in Texas. The price pressure is really most severe, I think, at that kind of the larger deals, large investment quality or near investment quality kinds of credits. I keep a running list of all the deals that are going through our senior loan committees side and jotting them on pricing on every one of them and just -- and I'm still seeing kind of on smaller middle market kinds of deals, by and large, still pretty reasonable pricing. When we get into the larger high-quality deals, north of $25 million, $30 million, everybody's going after that business pretty hard. So I -- happily, our sweet spot tends to be a little smaller end of that range, and there are a lot of small business lending, a lot of kind of the smaller end of the middle market, kind of activity that we do, and so far, that's actually held up reasonably well. Not a lot of change in the last quarter.", "James R. Abbott", "Yes, Scott. I was just add -- this is James. I would just add that C&I loan yields were down only about 15 as in 1-5 basis points from the prior quarter in terms of our production. So there is some pressure, but we're not dealing with extreme situations on that front. At Zions Bank, where we produce a lot of those smaller SBA loans and are a leader in the country for that, the yield loans, C&I production overall for the quarter was over 5%, so still pretty healthy on some fronts.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Pancari from Evercore Partners.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about quantification of the margin pressure that you expect here in the fourth quarter then going through 2012? Could it be to the extent that we saw this quarter? And then also, can you just talk a little about the opportunities around the deposit side? It's not just lowering deposit costs, but also may be deflecting some of the deposit growth that you're seeing?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Now with regard to the latter, the last part of your question, I mean, we've already done a great deal of deflecting where it can be done without impairing customer relationships. Again, most of the buildup in deposits is existing commercial customers' DDA balances. And we've -- you only have so many levers to play with there, and it's not clear what the impact would be of changing earnings credit rates in this environment, so we're proceeding very, very cautiously on that front. We're not going to -- we're certainly not going to tell customers, \"Take your money and go away.\" Because the day will come, believe it or not, when we will value their deposits again. So we're not going to commit unnatural acts on that front. In terms of the overall pressures, yes, I think the pressures are basically the ones that we've talked about. There is -- everybody's hungry for earning assets, particularly for high-quality larger loans, so we do expect -- I don't think the pricing pressure will get worse. But I do think the pricing pressure will persist on those loans going forward. But as Harris said, a lot of our production is in the middle market, the smaller business arena. We will -- we're probably not going -- I mean, there's no reason to expect we're going to see an immediate outflow of a lot of these deposits that have come on. That may happen later in 2012, which could strengthen the margin, but not necessarily the earnings. And we do have a -- we continue to have a little bit of room, and we're gradually exercising that on interest-bearing deposits. On Page 16, we sort of give you the breakdown, the average cost of money market accounts being down 5 basis points; time -- small time deposits, 8 basis points; jumbo time, 7 basis points, and so forth. So we do continue to -- as time deposits mature, they're renewing at much lower rates, very low rates, in fact, in this environment, compared to when they were put on 1 to 2 years ago. So those will continue to come down. But -- so I think there's no reason to expect a dramatic change in the margin over the next few quarters.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, [indiscernible]. Secondarily, can you just talk a little bit about your loan growth outlook? I know you mentioned for stable to modest growth. But can you talk about where you're starting to see some pickup in demand? And then also the timing of the remaining runoff or paydowns that you expect in the construction book?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, temporally, if you look across time, we saw -- every -- the optimism about loan growth became a lot stronger around the company in the second quarter and it translated into actual growth. We did see continued strong pipelines, but more difficulty converting some of that into core business and drawn lines in the third quarter. We got the sense that businesses did turn more cautious in the third quarter. There seems to be a bit of a renewed note of optimism around the company, and we're starting -- we're seeing a little bit more -- the C&I loan growth continues apace and has for between $200 million and $300 million a quarter, kind of looks like it will be on a similar track. I mean, the swing element has been, as you point out, the C&D runoff. It was -- that's a harder -- that's a little bit harder for us to predict if we really have systems and then ask our customers to input every month where -- what they were expected to pay down and finish. We could do a better job of that. But I think it's already moderated a lot. I would expect it to continue to moderate. There's still not a lot of new construction out there, so things continue to finish and run off, but it's already moderated. I just can't tell you when it's going to turn into a net 0. Across geographically, probably the strongest growth continues to be in Texas. Commercial loans, a lot of them is driven in one way or another, and remains pretty good there. And -- but we don't see strong net negatives kind of anywhere in the franchise at this point. Harris, you've just been around. Is there any particular comment you want to make on as you tour around.", "H. H. Simmons", "No. I think that right. Pipelines are probably better than they were a couple of 3 months ago. I mean, it feels like it's picking back up a little bit, but it's certainly not going to write home about. It's still soft.", "James R. Abbott", "And I think I would just add, John, that from some of the conference calls that I've listened to, that there seems to be some of those that are growing C&I at stronger rates tend to be doing so through the syndicated portfolios. And that's not a significant business for us. We saw a little bit of net increase in syndicated loans quarter, maybe $70 million or so, but we're not growing that at a rapid phase in part because I mean, that's part of the size range where there you have the most pricing pressure. So the yields -- those are growing out or aren't giving you same marginal yield that we're getting with more modest growth.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Todd Hagerman from Sterne Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Doyle, the word uncertainty has been used quite a bit by a number of the banks this quarter. And I just -- as I listen to your comments on the CDO portfolio, and in particular, some of the dynamics that we saw this quarter with the prepayments and the risks that you mentioned in terms of the AOCI risk. Can you just talk a little bit in terms of how you -- as you think about the economics of the residual portfolio as it stands today and kind of the risk to kind of capital, if you will, and kind of pro forma capital, how do you weigh now that position in terms of with that uncertainty, the prepayments, the AOCI? When would the decision potentially be made to cut, to sell, do nothing? How are you thinking about it now?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Now? We're certainly not thinking of selling right now. We've been opportunistic. But I mean, the fact is, liquidity just totally dried up in the CDO portfolio again during the third quarter after showing some signs of life in the first and more in the second quarter. The uncertainty, again, a lot of it coming out of Europe, but a pretty steady stream for about 2-month period from late July to late September of negative U.S. economic numbers really hurt that market. And that negativity was reflected in one, drying up liquidity; but two, the higher credit spreads that we applied to the future cash flows. But again paradoxically, just like corporate balance sheets are healing, so are bank balance sheets. We continue -- and that's what's underlying these securities. Let's not forget -- are the balance sheets of individual banks. The average probability of default on our entire exposure pool improved a bit during the third quarter as we measure it, and we -- as I mentioned, we've gotten pretty darn good about nailing those. We had -- I think we had 6 or 7 banks out of the failures in the quarter that we had exposure to. All but one of those, I believe, we've modeled at 100% probability of default and the other one was at 99-point-something. So I'm pretty confident in our model's ability to measure that. The -- and the strengthening of their balance sheets is reflected in the fact that more of them, even smaller ones, felt confident enough in their balance sheet and earnings prospects that they redeemed the trust preferred securities, and others resumed dividend payments. So the fundamental exposures that we have are healing. Now in our own CDO pool, we own both senior tranches and mezzanine tranches. The -- this phenomenon has kind of differential impact on the 2. As banks prepay, it improves the position of the senior tranches, but it can cause additional OTTI in the junior tranches. And the increasing in prepayments also will improve the AOCI marks. And roughly speaking, if it's just due to changes in prepayments, about a one percentage point pickup in the prepayment speeds translates into about $10 million of additional OTTI, but a $40 million improvement in AOCI. So that's a trade we'll take every day. And we think we're probably likely to see more of. And now it just so happens though that because of the turmoil in Europe, the change in the discount rate in the credit spreads, swapped that fundamental phenomenon this quarter. But we're certainly not going to panic because of that and dump a bunch of stuff into a totally illiquid market. We're pretty confident that we understand the dynamics here, and we're going to ride it through.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, as you mentioned the fundamental exposures are improving, which is encouraging. So where does that leave you in terms of the total return swap?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We review it every quarter. It's still in place. It has a -- quite apart from the fundamental dynamics. I mean it has a -- I would argue that the rating agencies have not responded to the improving fundamentals that we are clearly observing. They -- and it's ratings that still drive the classified securities -- the classification of these securities and regulatory and also their risk -- and the risk ratings -- risk weightings of those securities are also not directly the results of the ratings, but heavily influenced by the ratings. So as long as the regulatory classification and risk weighting schemes are based on rating agency ratings that don't reflect the underlying reality of the securities, frankly, the total return swap helps it -- helps us better reflect that reality on our balance sheet and then our classified ratios. And so it has utility from that standpoint.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So I guess what I'm hearing is it's pretty fair to say that all else being equal, you're not panicking. You're obviously monitoring the situation in Europe very closely. But again, as you look at the economics, and in particular, the corollary with the total return swap, it's basically status quo, at least, for now is what I'm hearing.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That's correct. I just took a poll around the table and nobody's panicked.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "So that's encouraging. We don't want to hear panic in Salt Lake.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask a question about interest income and the loan portfolio. Doyle, maybe can you just walk us through -- there's a decent amount of support to the net interest income from the swap, the -- I'm sorry, the loan floors. I'm just wondering, can you just walk us through how the gradation, of how the floors, I guess, mature with loan maturities? And to what extent you're able to replace those with new floors on loans and if there's any pricing differences in terms of new floors as well?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I don't think we've updated that information since the last IR presentations that we did. I would say -- I mean, I'm going to make a statement and I'm going to invite James who may -- or Walter who may have torn into it more than I have to contradict me. But in general, if you go back 18 months ago, we were getting floors on 60% to 70% of new production and they were often at 5% to 5.5%. You pretty much can't talk about floors on larger loans, those with the kind of pricing pressure that Harris described. You can still talk about them on more middle market loans. So we're down to -- I mean, last time we did update this, and I know where we were getting it on 30% to 40% of new production, and they were more typically in the 4%, maybe 4.5% range. Anybody -- I'm seeing head nodding affirmatively here, so I don't think we have information that would be different than that right now.", "James R. Abbott", "Yes, I don't have a definitive answer for you, Ken. The last -- I would point out that over a 6-month timeframe, we lost about 3 basis points in net interest margin due to the erosion of floors, so kind of 6 basis points a year is the run rate that it's been running off. It was -- the last time we updated it, which was June numbers, was, I believe, 22 basis points of favorable benefit to the net interest margin. On a related point, somebody asked earlier how much costs the cash is having an impact. It's probably -- last time, we updated that at June, it was over -- it was up 46 basis points. It would be probably around 50 or so basis points of lost net interest margin as a result of the high cash balances.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And my follow-up question is, turning back to the TARP question. Doyle, do you presume that at the point that you're ready to repay TARP that you'll need to be thinking about what to do with the TruPS portfolio at that point? I mean, do you get the sense that there'll have to be some coincidental strategy or plan? Or is that not even part of the TARP conversation at all?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, the TARP conversation has not occurred for the reasons that I'd described earlier. And I don't want to presuppose what those conversations will entail. Or I just -- I have no way to know. And if I did, I wouldn't talk -- I probably wouldn't talk about it here. I'll be saving that for discussion with the Fed. That's where those discussions have to take place. And when we have an action that we're prepared to take, we'll announce it and take it, but that day is not today.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Actually, my questions have been covered.", "Operator", "And our next question from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets. ", "RBC Capital markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "The addition to the classifieds and NPL buckets have been coming down nicely. I'd just be curious though where are you still seeing some inflows and what do the issues tend to be?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Now they tend to be in the -- they tend to be on smaller -- on small business loans, some of the SBA-related loans still. There's a little higher level of stress happening, I think, on smaller businesses. That would be the one thing to [indiscernible] that's -- we've got this national real estate portfolio, some in that, although that's coming down. The inflows there are coming down reasonably nicely as well. But where we have them, the inflows are increasingly granular.", "I can't think of a large, new -- I would say a couple [indiscernible] probably more discussions, but the numbers are way down from what it used to be. I mean, it's -- they tend to stand out these days, and it used to be that you couldn't keep track of them.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then with the income statement on Page 11, you've got these 2 line items, other real estate expense and credit-related expense. How much of that is still coming from updated valuation adjustments? And just in general, what pace do you expect these 2 line items to decline from here, given your positive thoughts about the ongoing improvement in credit?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, the other real estate expense is due to value declines or after the write-down when we foreclosed and took it into the OREO. The credit-related expense really isn't. It's all the other expenses that are directly related to working out credits and so forth. So we're just trying to give you a breakout of that. I mean, those -- they've been relatively flat for a couple of quarters now. I mean, they should -- as we continue to work down classifieds and have fewer problems to resolve, I would think in 2012, we'll start to see more significant decline in those numbers yet. But those numbers also -- but I don't yet have a real trend forecast to give you.", "James R. Abbott", "Joe, the gain and loss ratio this quarter was about the same. The amount of gains that we took in the portfolio are relatively now losses upon sale. It was about the same as it was last quarter. We did have a little bit of...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "OREO.", "James R. Abbott", "OREO provisions, right. And we did have a little bit more in the way of volume that moved through that portfolio, particularly in Utah Land's bank franchise, there was a little bit more volume there.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "And a lot of that was the national real estate group, SBA 504, I think, that Harris was just talking about earlier. But yes, I mean, if you go back precrisis, those numbers would have been low single digits for each of those line items. So over the next couple of years, we'd converge back toward a number more like that.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Brian Foran from Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "It's Brian Foran. As we think about the long-term signs in the balance sheet, in your last conference presentation, in your interest rate risk simulation slide at the back of the presentation, there was a footnote that kind of said in a rising rate scenario, you assume noninterest-bearing shrinks by $5.4 billion and savings shrinks by $0.8 billion. Can you just walk through the methodology to come up with that? And the point of that slide that you're asset-sensitive, even if you have those kind of deposit outflows? Or was the point that an normalized environment, we should really think about the deposit that being much smaller?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, essentially, Brian, what we did was look at the net increase in DDA balances. That's the bulk of it, from about late 2007 or early -- some time in 2008, about when we had between $9 billion and $10 billion of commercial DDA balances, through the present. And we've added customers during that time but the balance of -- average balances or total balances have grown from little under $10 billion to over $15 billion. We assumed that in a stronger recovering economy, in which unlimited FDIC insurance would go away, that, and in which the Fed would reverse Operation Twist and begin to let rates rise again, that we would see that most of those -- that increase in balances related to customers that were there, say at the beginning of 2008, not -- we took -- we set aside balances from new customers, and said \"Okay, those are vulnerable.\" And in that scenario, those balances would be vulnerable and probably would go away. So if they didn't go away, we would have an even stronger asset-sensitive position than what we have indicated to you, and we'd benefit even more from the scenario that I described. But we actually think that it's more realistic to think that we'll see in this cycle a version, may be even a somewhat exaggerated version, of what we've seen in every other cycle, which is the portion of our balance sheet funded by DDA tends to decline in very strong times, and it gets stronger in the weaker times. So that's the -- so the $5 billion number wasn't just pulled out of the air. There was that degree of analysis behind it. And so we're trying to show you a more conservative realistic asset-sensitive picture. Did I respond to your question?", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "No, you got me good. I mean, I guess, I'm also thinking also from an industry perspective to try to figure out how much of the deposits are inflated. I mean, when you talk to the customers, is there any potential that, structurally, looks smaller money markets leads to them consolidating more balances with you? Or is there anything that leads you to believe that the deposits might stick around this time? Or as you put it, while the estimate's conservative, do you still view it as realistic?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I mean, there is reason to believe that money market funds may not be as competitive going forward as they were in the past. I would agree with you on that. But we didn't have -- we couldn't think of a way to kind of factor that into the analysis. So we kind of assumed that it would be. And to -- to the extent that they're not a stronger competition, then our analysis would be overly conservative.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "If I could sneak in one last follow-up. Is there -- just to get a sense of how much market sensitivity there is in AOCI swings, I'm hesitant to ask about day-to-day updates for the TruPS CDOs, but just as the market [indiscernible] through October could get type of market moving up to October, we've seen -- have a material change to the AOCI you would have printed it for the quarter closed and not 3 weeks later?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I don't -- we don't run that on a daily basis. I don't think we can give you an update. I would intuitively and qualitatively, I think you're right. If we reclosed the quarter today, it would probably be less severe given generally what I'm aware of. But we actually do a pretty careful analysis of looking at lots of data to try to come up with those discount rates. And they were -- I guess they were probably about as wide as we've ever used, maybe the widest we've ever used in this last quarter. And what I've seen would indicate, they probably should have come back in a little bit over the last 2 weeks. But we don't -- we basically true that up in the third month of the quarter. We don't -- when all data's in. We don't try to monitor it every week. So it's a complicated exercise. I mean, we can't do it weekly, frankly.", "Operator", "So we'll take our last question from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Doyle, you made the point that several subs are now paying dividends for the holding company. I'm just wondering, is the business implication from this just more cash at the holding company? Is there something else we should be thinking about?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That's the immediate implication, yes, more cash at the holding company. Yes, I would say, yes, more broadly, I'll just note that it's a little bit unfair. But if you simply added up all the banks this quarter, they were all profitable. And the sum of the net income after tax was almost $150 million. I think it's about $147 million at the bank level. Now there's -- if you look at the net income available to common, it was $65 million or less than half of that. About $44 million of that is preferred dividends that the parent pays on TARP on some rather expensive preferred that we issued during the crisis, the Series E and so forth. There were some losses taken at the parent that -- but there's a -- fundamentally, the earnings engine of the company is running at about a $600 million a year after-tax rate right now. And what's incumbent upon us is to get some of the noise from a lot of expensive funding and capital and whatnot behind us over the next year to start bringing that to the bottom line. And part of that is getting the banks to pay dividends to the parent, to repatriate some of the capital that we pushed down to the parent. We need -- we fundamentally need cash at the parent to repay TARP, and so that's encouraging. And that $600 million is probably, on a long-term run rate, it's exaggerated because there were -- some of the banks had reserve releases, as I mentioned. And -- but fundamentally, the underlying engine of the company is healing pretty nicely right now. It's got a ways to go, but that's the thought I'd like to leave you with. And I think with that, that's probably our last question. I guess Steve, you get a follow-up, if you wanted.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A short one. Did you bulk sale any loans this quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Not that I'm aware of.", "James R. Abbott", "Not of any materials.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No. Okay. James, thanks very much. There are a handful of people left in the queue, and we will get back to you as soon as we can tonight.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.", "James R. Abbott", "Good evening, and we welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2011 earnings. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information and which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. If you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will limit the length of the call to one hour which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]", "I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris?", "H. H. Simmons", "Thank you all very much for joining us this evening. We are overall quite pleased with the progress you saw this quarter on asset quality. And we expect continued improvement in the first quarter, particularly with respect to net charge-offs but also with other asset quality metrics. ", "As you've seen in the release, our nonperforming assets declined 16%, and within that number, other real estate owned declined a strong 25%, so we're very pleased with that. Additionally, a favorable resolutions with nonaccrual loans such as payoffs and upgrades equaled 1.8x the number of unfavorable or the volume of unfavorable resolutions such as charge-offs.  A year ago, that ratio was 1.4x. ", "Quarterly new inflows and declassified loans declined an additional 8% after declining an unusually strong 20% last quarter. Annualized, declassified loan inflows equaled $1.3 billion, which compares to the end-of-period balance of $2.1 billion. And we expect classified loans to continue to decline over at least the next few quarters. ", "Our allowance for credit loss ratio to annualized net charge offs remains at one of the highest levels in the industry at 3 years, and this is despite a $95 million sequential quarter reduction in the allowance for current loss balance. ", "Loan balances grew $427 million. However, we note that the average balance grew at a much more moderate pace of $113 million. Customers borrowed significantly in the latter weeks of the quarter and paid down about $200 million of these balances in the first week of January, so we're inclined to focus on the average balance growth. Nevertheless, the increase on average balances is an improvement from the prior quarter's modest decline of $56 million. ", "The greatest challenge of the quarter is evident in the net interest income line, which declined by 1.8% compared with the prior quarter. The decline was caused by loan and pricing activity, due to both maturities of loans that were brought to several years ago at higher rates, as well as adjustable rate loans that reached reset dates. For these same reasons, we expect pressure on loan rates throughout 2012 and perhaps into 2013, depending on what happens with the yield curve. ", "However, there are 2 positive developments that should help provide some support for net interest income during 2012: First, given a moderate strengthening in customer sentiment and stronger pipelines and continued production momentum, stronger loan growth in 2012 should support net interest income; secondly, loan pricing appears to be firming across most categories in loan sizes. Net, we believe that net interest income should be relatively stable during the next year. ", "As we look into 2012, despite a challenging revenue environment, we do expect to see growth in earnings per share. Some of you look at earnings excluding reserve releases. With the continued improvement in asset quality, that number should rise in 2012, primarily driven by declines in net charge-offs. ", "Finally, my remarks, I just want to point out that Zions is participating in the Federal Reserve Capital Plan Review 2012 process, and we timely submitted our capital plan, stress test results and related documentations required on January 9. While we feel comfortable with our submission and results, we consider that filing and the subsequent Federal Reserve review currently underway to be part of an ongoing regulatory process that won't be complete until we were in the outcome of the Federal Reserve review on March 15. Therefore, we will not comment or speculate on the outcome of that review prior to announcing them on or shortly after March 15. ", "So with that brief overview, I'll ask our Chief Financial Officer and Vice Chairman, Doyle Arnold, to review the quarterly performance. Doyle?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. As first and few -- a little overview, as noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $44.4 million or $0.24 per diluted common share for the quarter. As we've done in the past, we also presented the earnings in a way that excludes the noncash impact of the sub debt amortization, when it converts into preferred, et cetera, and also the FDIC-assisted loan discount accretion. We think this adjusted number is useful to longer-term investors as we do not expect those income and expense items to be with us in perpetuity. On that basis, earnings were $0.30 a share, down from $0.40 per share last quarter. ", "There were a number of significant items that occurred during the fourth quarter that are worth noting. Within noninterest income, we recorded $12 million of OTTI on securities this quarter, which included about $5 million of OTTI that was taken to adjust model default probabilities in the medium term, not the near term. We made those probabilities in years 2 through 5, a bit more conservative than they have been. ", "I would note that our model has been particularly conservative lately in predicting near term or one-year default probabilities, so we didn't adjust those, and we continue to be predicting a bit more in the way of defaults than are actually occurring in the near term. ", "Secondly, as we've previously discussed, the Durbin Amendment processed about $8 million. I believe our previous estimate had been $9 million but we currently estimate it was about $8 million in the quarter, and that is found in the Other Service Charges line item on the income statement. We do expect that service charges and deposit fees will increase somewhat as we move through 2012 and attempt to reevaluate some of our other pricing for services in the consumer and other space. ", "Within noninterest income, there are a couple of things -- I'm sorry, noninterest expense, there are a couple of things worth noting. The salary and benefits line item, you'll note, increased overall by about $3 million. However, as we mentioned in the release, there was a $6 million expense related to employee benefits -- accrual for employee benefit expense that will not recur and actually related to a prior period. ", "Legal and professional expense line item included about $3.5 million related to consulting and professional service expenses incurred in our capital plan and stress test preparation for the CCAR 2012 exercise. Because of our first official submission under the Dodd-Frank Act, we hired a couple of outside advisers and have consulted with previous participants to get their insight and expertise. And that again is an expense that we don't think will recur. Additional increases in this line were related primarily to seasonal increases and should decline somewhat in the first quarter. ", "And in the other noninterest expense line, there was -- we accrued about $7 million for potential loss contingencies -- excuse me, for litigation extending from several legal matters, including several that are similar to those that have occurred at a number of other banks. Put that $7 million in perspective by comparison, we had accrued a total of $3 million for legal expenses through the first 3 quarters of 2011. And therefore, the full year total is about $10 million. ", "As you can probably appreciate the timing of such accruals are somewhat episodic, and the dollar amount per situation can change from time to time so it's very hard to guide to a number for 2012. Also included in that line item, the other noninterest expense is the amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset which was about $13 million this quarter. ", "Now I'd like to turn the page -- turn to credit and refer you to Page 12. And I'll add a couple of details to Harris' other comments where he'd indicated that we've had significant improvement in credit quality. If you'll note on the first line on Page 12, nonaccrual loans declined from $1,039,000,000 to $886 million or about a 15% decline. And then as Harris mentioned, the next line, other real estate owned, was down about 25%. ", "Scanning on down the page, nonaccrual loans plus accruing loans past due 90 days or more were down from $1,169,000,000 to $1,004,000,000, so about a $165 million decline. The very last line, classified loans, came down by a bit over $300 million, similar to the pace of the prior quarter as we've continued to push aggressively to resolve problems. ", "The one line that was a little more sticky is not on that page, it's, I don't believe, it's on another page that relates to the reserve. But net charge-offs were down but by a lower percentage. We do expect to see a somewhat larger drop in net charge-offs in the first quarter than they -- the kind of the gradual decline of about $10 million we've seen in the last couple of quarters, and we think there's a really good chance that, that number will be down significantly. ", "Essentially throughout 2012, including the last couple of quarters, we were pushing very aggressively to resolve problem situations and got through a lot of those, and we'll continue to work down the problem loans but we think that the net charge-off number is likely to decline meaningfully in the first quarter compared to the third and fourth quarters of last year. ", "The NPA, or nonperforming asset, resolution rate set a recent high at 31% at the beginning, NPA balances plus quarterly inflows. And of the more than $450 million of NPAs resolved, nearly 70% were resolved favorably such as through payoffs, paydowns or upgrades. Loss severity for the trailing 12 months generally continues to improve from about 10% of total classified loans to just a hair over 8% of classified loans. ", "Construction, both residential and commercial and commercial real estate -- excuse me, construction and C&I business loan loss severity improved. Term commercial real estate loan severity was stable, and owner-occupied loan loss severity was slightly higher. But again, this was one of the areas that we're working particularly hard to address problems situations and work down classified assets. ", "Turning now to some of the revenue drivers on Page 11, the preceding page. You'll see the change in loan balances by type. We experienced, on the first line, particularly strong growth in C&I loans, up about 6% sequentially or $607 million. As Harris mentioned, we did experience some attrition, a couple of hundred million in the first quarter in total loans. So it looks like there were some window dressing that may have gone on, on the part of some of these customers near quarter end. But based on what is -- as Harris mentioned were strong pipelines, we would expect some continued growth in this category in the first quarter. ", "These new C&I loans are priced on average relatively neutral to our overall NIM, and to the extent we can fund these loans with existing cash, which is quite doable. The loan growth would be accretive -- will be quite accretive to the net interest margin. Importantly, pricing on our C&I production, new loans, had increased a few basis points over the prior couple of quarters, so the growth that we saw this last quarter didn't come as a result of any slackening of pricing discipline. ", "And to answer a question that we've heard some analysts have been asking our peers regarding purchase loan activities, we're both a syndicator of loans and a buyer of syndicated loans, and the 2 more or less offset each other, not perfectly. But going to the bottom line, about 1/3 of the company's linked quarter C&I loan growth was driven by an increase in our net syndicated loan portfolio, which means about 2/3 of the growth was unrelated to syndications. ", "If you go down a few lines on the commercial real estate, the construction and development portfolio declined about $200 million or 8% sequentially. $60 million of the decline was due to conversions into term CRE, and you can see the term CRE category, the next line, did grow modestly to $7.9 billion. So some but not all of the growth in term CRE is explained by completion of construction projects, and they had leased up and were rolled into [indiscernible]. A small $13 million of the decline in construction and development was due to net charge-offs, but the large majority either paid off or paid down during the quarter. ", "New production and draws on construction and development lines continues to increase, was up for the fourth consecutive quarter. By way of a reminder, about 2/3 of the construction and development portfolio is for commercial buildings, and most of the property types are experiencing healthy improvement in cap rates, moderate improvement in occupancy rates and generally stable effective rents. And those trends, of course, are supportive of credit quality and loan growth both in the C&D and term CRE portfolios. ", "Turning to Page 15. We break out the major drivers of the net interest margin. We've detailed the major NIM changes in the release. But to summarize, deposit inflows remain quite strong during the quarter and were up on average $800 million -- in excess of $800 million. But anecdotally, if you flip back to Page 9, you can see the total period -- the quarter end to quarter end deposits grew by $1.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion was DDA and most of that was commercial. We saw the same year-end pattern in deposits as in loans, namely a strong run-up in the month of December in deposits, followed by a significant reversal in the first week of January. Significantly, it didn't reverse by any means all of that run-up but some hundreds of millions went out in the first week of January. So we, again, see indicators of some window dressing perhaps on the part of commercial customers. ", "On the asset side, average loans, as Harris I think mentioned, increased $114 million. Average securities declined $471 million, driving an increase in average cash balances of more than $1 billion. The decline in securities was essentially the result of a decision to sell or runoff the $700 million of short-term treasuries that the parent company here owned and parked the money in cash, both were at very low yields, but and therefore it didn't materially affect the NIM. ", "But the net result from the -- attributable to the increase in cash on the balance sheet was a decline in the NIM of approximately 8 basis points. Aside from that, the NIM declined an additional 5 basis points, which is attributable to 2 factors: First, adjustable-rate loan caps from loans originated several years earlier are resetting to lower rates as the repricing index is lower now than when those loans were booked. Secondly, maturing loans, many of which have rate floors, were replaced with new loans at lower coupons or lower floors compared to the loans originated when spreads were higher. We think the NIM will be under pressure for an extended period from those forces by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter as we look at the maturity and repricing schedule of the loans. However, it doesn't take too much loan growth at current pricing to offset that. So if and as loan growth strengthens and we're able to trade cash for loans and affect the pickup, the net interest income should offset this pricing pressure. ", "And as Harris noted, we do -- it does seem to be the case that new loan pricing has roughly stabilized in recent months. ", "Finally, our balance sheet does remain quite asset-sensitive, where an upward parallel shift in the yield curve of 200 basis points would result in an increase in net interest income of more than 10%. We, of course, are not forecasting an immediate parallel increase of 200 basis points, but that will give you an illustration of just how asset-sensitive we are. ", "Shifting to a discussion of capital. GAAP tangible common equity ratio declined to 6.77% from 6.9%. That's entirely due to the buildup in deposits, which drove the buildup in cash balances. If the balance sheet size had simply remained static compared to the third quarter, the TCE ratio would have improved to about 7.0%. And we give you in the schedules attached to the released the regulatory capital ratios, which were relatively stable, Tier 1 common, we estimate at 9.55%, essentially unchanged versus 9.53% in the prior quarter. And we're estimating our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio fully phased in at roughly 7.9%. ", "So that's kind of some -- it's the end of the quick tour through the balance sheet and income statement. In terms of what to expect in the coming quarter or a few quarters, we do expect continued improvement in credit quality, including significant reduction in net charge-offs in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. This should allow us to keep the provision very low. We look for net interest income to be relatively stable. We think OTTI should remain relatively low. We are not aware of any assumption changes at this point that we're likely to make that would affect that, and so far we have had no exposure to any bank failures so far this quarter. There'd only been 3, mostly very small ones nationwide, we had exposure to none. ", "Noninterest operating expenses will be up a bit in the first quarter due to normal seasonal trends. Things like FICA, tax, everybody will be paying that in the first quarter. There'll also be a modest couple of million dollar increase, I believe, in pension costs for this year. But on the other hand, noninterest credit-related expenses should continue to decline as we go through the year. ", "With that, operator, we will pause for a minute to let people log in for questions, and be pleased to start taking questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pancari from Evercore Partners.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Doyle, in your margin outlook that you provide, the 2 to 4 basis points per quarter, can you talk about the plans for the excess liquidity sitting on the balance sheet, the $8 billion that you had at the end of the quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, the plans for the $8 billion are not to do -- not to go out and buy a bunch of securities with it. And since it all results from customer deposits, we're not going to encourage customers to leave. So the likelihood and what we'd like to do is use that to fund what does appear to be some beginnings of a little greater loan demand and loan growth that we're seeing out there. But that, of course, will take time. But as we look around the other opportunities, we continue to price very, very low non-relationship CDs and other non-relationship deposit accounts, and to not have anything on the balance sheet that isn't core customer-related to the greatest extent possible. But we're not going to go out and buy mortgage-backed securities or very long dated treasuries at these historically extremely low interest rates and then get caught on the wrong side when the Fed, at some point, inevitably, will begin to tighten.", "James R. Abbott", "John, this is James. I would just comment, I've talked to a number of relationship managers across the company, that most of them are responding that the loan growth that they're seeing is a function of natural loan demand as opposed to just fighting and scrapping for market share at all costs. And so there is some natural organic demand and that's encouraging. So that will hopefully help draw down some of the cash balances.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Okay. And then the other thing is these customers, a lot of this is commercial DDA buildup and if and as we're seeing gains or a bit of a recovery in the economy, we would expect some of those customers to start putting those balances to work in their companies as opposed to parking them in insured deposit accounts.", "H. H. Simmons", "I would just also add, the $8 billion figure, about $1 billion of that is really float. I mean, it's -- so there's a significant piece of that, that's actually just always going to be there for any bank. And the other thing I'd just add is that we do expect that there are going to be greater constraints on the ability to deploy cash. We're going to have to have higher liquidity standards going forward. And so some portion of that, I expect, will be more permanent than it's been in the past.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I guess one final thing I forgot to note. We have about $1.4 billion that is earmarked one way or another to -- for TARP repayment. And so exiting TARP would reduce those cash balances by that amount, reduces total balance sheet size by that amount, and improve net earnings to common by $70 million a year.", "H. H. Simmons", "One final thing that needs to be taken into consideration is the fact that we have unlimited insurance on DDA up until December 31 of this year. And we show that we've got a lot of excess DDA balances, which we believe are coming from corporations that are here just because it's easy, and they've got unlimited FDIC insurance, so that too will soft -- as that money gets to the end of the year, expect some of that will leave and it will reduce the cash balances.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "And that's a significant number. I mean, depending on how we try to estimate that, we come up to something like $3 billion to $5 billion of that is commercial customers who were here several years ago and are still here and have that much more in their checking accounts than they did then.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just quickly, how much of cash at the parent did you have at the end of the quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "About $1 billion.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Klock from Keefe, Bruyette.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on John's question about parent company cash. Doyle, I guess how much capacity do you have at the bank's upstream capital? And does that include the ability to redeem some of the preferred, or do you still have preferred that you can redeem?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "You mean preferred at the banks?", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "At the banks, right.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think over time that there is excess capital at the banks. I think withdrawing it requires regulatory approval, and we have had preliminary discussions with the regulators about the appropriate amount and pace and constraints on withdrawing it. I think with the -- until -- there are probably some constraints on that still, from concerns about the possibility of the double dip and the regulators were certainly part of the stress testing. It's not just overall capital of the company but capital under stress at the individual banks. And we've laid that all out for the regulators and showed them what we think, but it's going to be up to them to decide what they think. I will just point out that, which I think you're all aware, we did upstream $100 million in the fourth quarter by redeeming some -- from our Nevada State Bank subsidiary, by redeeming some of their preferred stock, or that the parent had sent their way. And we would expect that we'll do more of that at a very measured pace as we go through 2012.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And really, I guess, with the pace of your classified assets cleaning up and improving, I guess give you more capacity to upstream capital and carry, right?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I would think it would over time, yes.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one real quick question, thanks for the color around the C&I growth. I would imagine that some of that syndicated credit growth was within the Amegy franchise. But can you give us an idea on the C&I growth, how much of it came from your different subsidiaries or your different regions?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "You're correct. The strongest was Amegy, followed by Zions Bank. I'm not sure who was in third place. Do you happen to have that information, James?", "James R. Abbott", "Yes. I would say 75% of it was those 2 banks. Very strong selling from Amegy in terms of that volume. And that was by far the strongest in terms of C&I growth.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We're not fumbling -- we can get back to you with the other rather than hold up. We're not finding the right page here. But that's the bulk of it. There was -- there was a little bit of growth just about everywhere as you kind of -- and there was basically none of the banks showed net shrinkage in C&I.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Doyle, you mentioned that you're talking how sensitive your NIM is to loan growth. What loan growth assumptions are you making in terms of your 2 to 4 basis point NIM compression assumption?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, the 2 to 4 -- I mean you could -- the 2 to 4 basis points a quarter was the compression that results from older loans resetting or repricing as we go through 2012. So it would take an equivalent -- roughly an equivalent amount of reduction in funding costs, or it would take -- if you wanted to offset all of it with loan growth at a 300 basis point spread over cash, you can figure it's probably $500 million, $600 million a quarter if you had to do it all that way, but the reality is it will be probably -- we think it's quite feasible to see it offset by a combination of those 2 things.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So just to be clear, though. So that's the loan aspect of it. Do you guys have any expectations for all-in NIM compression, given a set level of loan growth?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, we're not trying to focus on the NIM compression all-in because it is so crazy right now with this $1 billion of cash coming in, in one quarter and then some -- hundreds of millions of it coming -- going out in the first week of the next quarter. That's the biggest...", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, totally understandable. I guess of the 13 basis points, 8 is the cash impact so you can certainly set that aside. It's more of the 5 basis points of your other security or loan and earning asset-related compression...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "And it was mostly all driven by the loans and the repricing of older loans and resetting of older floors. So and it's kind of that 5 that you should compare to the 2 to 4 that we outlined as being -- and it varies -- we've tried to schedule out the maturity resets of the loans for the next 4 quarters. James has actually mucked around and done that, and it kind of varies between 2 and 4 per quarter depending on which quarter you're in. If every loan that matured in quarter 2 reset at today's spreads, what would the -- and all of that, that would result in, depending on the quarter, 2 to 4 basis points per quarter from that. And we're saying we think that the current spreads over a matched maturity cost of funds are kind of in the 3.25% over range. So if you -- it doesn't take a lot of loans. If you were going to offset, totally the impact of that little bit of compression with loan growth, you can calculate it out, just do 3% over earning of the cash and you get to about $600 million a quarter that it would take. But I'm saying that's not the only source of how you offset it. There's funding costs, I believe, are still drifting down a little bit, and there's a little more room to go there too. But we had a -- it was a bit larger reset impact in the fourth quarter than we expect to see over the next few, at 5 basis points compared to 2 to 4.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, now that helps. And then just very quickly on the expense guidance of up in the first quarter. Does that adjust for sort of the unusual expense items that you had this quarter? Or is that...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No, not necessarily...", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Or just in absolute, it's going to be up...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We're expecting mostly about kind of a salary and benefit line have some -- usually picks up in the first quarter because you're starting a new year with everybody, all the FICO and Medicare accruals and all that stuff. Anything I'm missing here, James? We weren't trying to say that we expect it to go up notwithstanding the $15 million of kind of one-off items that we broke out for you.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So we [indiscernible]...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It would be in addition to that, yes. We weren't trying to say it's going to go up even in addition to that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe I'll start, I just wanted to clarify, the loan payoffs that you're saying you saw here in the first quarter, were these the same customer that borrowed from you in the fourth quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No. No, no, no. These are the older loans that had fixed rates. Some of them would've been things like 5/1 ARMs, and back in time had some commercial mortgages, 5-year resets, et cetera.", "H. H. Simmons", "I want to make sure we got your question...", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No, I think I got you. So the rate reset higher and people basically paid these off essentially. I'm just trying to get at...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No. The margin compression was due to loans that maybe were 5/1 ARMs or 3/1s that were made in 2006, 2007, that came up to the end of that  -- when rates were quite a bit higher. And they came to the reset. And they reset at a much lower rate because the break to which -- the index is lower. Spread stayed the same, the index was lower, so the overall rate comes down. So that's one issue. That's what drove a lot of the 5 basis point compression.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "But Doyle, I wasn't asking for that. I'm asking for -- no, I'm asking for you referenced the loan payoffs early in the first quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes. What I think that was, people just drawing down on lines and for whatever reason to show more cash on their balance sheet or whatever and then repaying -- paying them back down. I mean, we haven't done it in customer-by-customer analysis, but there was a big increase in deposits, there was a big increase in loans. And the 2 may not have been unrelated. If the customer drew down on their loan and held the cash on deposit with us for whatever reason, I haven't tried to see if that's tightly linked. But we saw a big run-up in December of both loans and a lot of it commercial and commercial DBA balances. And in each case, somewhere between, I don't know, probably 30%, 40% of the increase got reversed out in the first week of January. Lines got paid back down, cash, the DDA balances went back down.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got you. Just one other follow-up question. With NII expected flat in 2012, the lower provision benefit is now basically in the earnings run rate. Any plans to cut cost in 2012 to improve profitability from where it is?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Do you want to talk, Harris, you want to...", "H. H. Simmons", "Well, just ongoing programs. I mean, we've continued to close down some branches. We've closed about 10 offices this past year. We got several others kind of on the drawing board. We don't see a big across-the-board kind of cut. We actually, back in 2009, quite dramatically cut some of the kind of core operating costs. And I think it is getting tougher to do that. I think where you're going to see costs coming down is in OREO expense credit costs. Those are the areas where we've really seen major increases, and they will continue to come down. But I think it's something we continue to work at but as we go along, we're quite focused on activities, branches, et cetera, that aren't making long-term sense as we look forward. So but we're not going to be reporting today a big project, if you will.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Stulpin from Raymond James.", "William Christian Stulpin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Regarding your C&I loan growth, Doyle, you mentioned roughly 1/3 was from syndicated relationships of syndicated loans. What has that ratio been typically in the past, or has it fluctuated greatly?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We haven't specifically tried to look at that in the past because the question hadn't particularly come up. I doubt if it's a whole lot different. I will note that the percentage of our total loans that are accounted for by syndicated loans has been pretty constant quarter-to-quarter for a while. It's not...", "William Christian Stulpin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Over the years.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, over the last couple of years, I mean. But as far as -- it's kind of hard to even answer the question because we've had slight net loan growth or net loan shrinkage over the last few quarters, so the percentage of that change that came from syndicated probably isn't very meaningful. But in terms of our total overall activity, it's roughly a constant portion of the balance sheet.", "William Christian Stulpin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And I guess my follow-up question, you mentioned that pricing has improved slightly. I was kind of surprised by that given the commentary I heard from other peers within your market that said it's still very intense. And I get the impression that you're having more banks entering your market, or at least more banks participating in growing loans within your market, given the arguably recovering economy. Can you speak about the pricing within your market?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I can speak to overall. I mean, we did -- I wouldn't get too fixated on this uptick of a couple -- a few basis points. But if I look back over the last 6 months, the all-in spread over matched maturity cost of funds kind of all originations of all kinds month-to-month-to-month-to-month has been fairly stable now in the 300 to 350 range, given our mix of loans. That's 300 to 350 over matched maturity cost of funds. That is down very sharply from where it was 2 years ago, 18 months ago, when it got up over 500. But it does seem to have come back to kind of the floor level where it was pre-crisis. And the rest of it is just, I think, anecdotally what James and we're hearing by talking to a number of our relationship officers, it's not that it's gotten better, it's just stopped getting brutally worse each quarter. It's somewhat more stabilized. Probably the area that we're hearing a little bit of increases is would probably be the result of some of the larger European banks perhaps shying away from the U.S. market to some degree, and that's allowing the U.S. banks to price a little bit better on some of those types of credits. That's probably the predominant area. On your small and middle market, you're seeing fairly stable pricing linked quarter. In most markets, I would comment that Nevada is still experiencing price weakness, and Nevada had generally a weak performance across their loan portfolio as a result of that not wanting to cave in on pricing. So but that the -- they're struggling, the market is struggling significantly, so that's probably a little color for you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "This is Jennifer Demba. I have a question about Durbin. Can you talk to us about strategy you're looking at to offset Durbin? And is the service charge run rate a good one going forward?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "One of the benefits of having 8 banks is that we kind of have 8 different strategies for offsetting that. We've left that to the banks, and they are, in fact, going to be doing different things. I mean we're look at various combinations of what others have done, monthly service charges, higher minimum balances, other things. But it all doesn't necessarily have to come out of the same consumers that -- or the fee erosion from Durbin came from. Now the $8 million reflects very little offset. We do expect that over the course of 2012 offset some of that, not all, somewhere between 1/3 and 2/3 probably, or where the banks have identified strategies. Harris, do you want to comment any further on that or...", "James R. Abbott", "No, I think that's, I think, where we are.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Okay. It should get a little better as time goes on.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Second question. Can you just talk in general about what you're seeing in the real estate market in Nevada and Arizona?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'll let Ken Peterson, the Chief Credit Officer, talk about that.", "Kenneth E. Peterson", "Nevada and Arizona, in particular, it's is still pretty flat. Very few opportunities. And that's not where we're seeing the opportunities in the commercial real estate. We are seeing some growth and opportunities in the coastal regions of California. We're seeing some in Texas and a little bit in Colorado. But not a whole lot of green shoots coming out of the 2 desert states.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "But at the same time, we're not seeing a re-deterioration of credit quality.", "Kenneth E. Peterson", "I think we have worked through most of our problems there, it's pretty flat. We're looking at a lot of different areas for opportunities. The commercial real estate is not our real growth opportunity at this point in the market in those states.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I would also add that we also -- I mean, we've seen stability in loan outstandings in those 2 target markets. But it's coming as a result of some growth in C&I and some consumers. So there's -- they're not continuing to shrink but it's -- we're having to offset some CRE shrinkage to stand still.", "H. H. Simmons", "Just a couple of little things to add. Vacancy rates in Las Vegas basically flat quarter-over-quarter. Vacancy rates in Phoenix improving somewhat. Cap rates actually are a pretty good story in both markets. Cap rates are coming down fairly significantly in both markets and have been for a while, from about 9% or so a couple of years ago to about 7%, 7.5%. That's still 150 basis points over other more established -- or not more established, but over more healthy markets like Los Angeles. Rent growth is still very, very anemic.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "The Nevada State dividend, I think that really came from more of a position of kind of capital and reserve strength probably more than earnings power. But I'm wondering, can you talk about what other subs you have that are in a position to dividend capital up this year?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, you're correct about Nevada, that was a return of capital, not a return on capital. But we have received dividends on preferred and common stock from California Bank & Trust, expect those to continue. From Zions Bank, expect those to continue -- actually, we have approval for this quarter, I don't know if that one has actually come. And from Amegy Bank, and expect those to continue. And those, of course, are the 3 largest banks that collectively account for 3/4 or more of the franchise from -- it will be a little -- it will be much smaller and a little more episodic from the other banks in 2012.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then with your comments of $1 billion of liquidity at the holdco, I think you have about $1.4 billion of debt. But how should we think about both debt and dividend coverage at the holding company in terms of the NIM level that you sort of don't want to break through future potential capital actions?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I don't want to go into -- I don't want to outline the whole capital and financing plan that we submitted to the Fed. But there are various components of it including dividends and return of capital from the banks, some financing actions. We've got $255 million of senior notes that were TLGP-guaranteed, for example, maturing in June that need to be refinanced. Our general thinking at this point is that we want to maintain at least 12 months, and preferably a bit more than that, of time to require funding at the parent. But it's going to be hard for you to piece together from that statement what the individual components are. And since they're all under review by the Fed, I'm not going to help you resolve that on this call. There is a path to get there, after March 15.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Really just 2 clarifications. First, you talked about net interest income being relatively stable over the next year. Just to clarify, do you mean stable with fourth quarter levels or with full year 2011 levels? And also, are you talking about reported or core net interest income?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We were hoping you wouldn't get that -- quite that picky. I think the reference was primarily with regard to the -- it's for the fourth quarter, which was, if you look at net interest income before provision, that was down from the third but it was the second highest. I guess -- and I'm not trying to be cute here. We don't know. One of the -- the first one of the bigger hits to that number on a GAAP basis has been the sub debt conversions, and we won't know and announce until February 15 or thereabouts what the first quarter impact would be. It's right now, the notices that we have a very, very small, but they always are this far in advance. Most of that comes in, in the last few days. But it's based on -- it's basically, that guidance was based on it being similar to what we've been seeing the last couple of quarters, which was kind of $15 million or so.", "James R. Abbott", "It's getting to a point where we'd expect that the -- just the mathematics of this results in low levels of conversions.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Joe, I would add that our accountants are quite pleased that the GAAP and non-GAAP measures actually converged this quarter, they were essentially unchanged, which makes every accountant happy. And the arch spread on the sub debt right now is between 1 point and 2 points. So it's not very attractive for anybody playing that game to convert. And it is a fourth quarter '11 to fourth quarter '12 outlook is what we're looking at.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. Okay. And then the other was, again not trying to pin you down to anything, but you talked about provision being relatively low. Is that more likely to be a 0 or a low-type number, or could we also see continued modest negative provisions?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'm not sure I'll let you pin me down because it's going to be what it will be, but if we have no uptick in severity of loss and we have continued reduction in classifieds and, as we have said, meaningfully lower charge-offs this quarter, it's hard to see how you get from -- absent a dramatic change in the economic environment, how you get from there to a significant positive number. So it's probably in near 0 or a little lower.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "A few questions for you. Doyle, you talked a little bit before that you still have some room on the deposit pricing side. And I'm just looking at the numbers, you still probably have amongst the highest all-in cost of liabilities among the peer group. And the mix has been improving as well as far as the non-interest-bearing inflows as well. So I'm just wondering, how much lower do you think that all-in cost of funding can go from the 104? And is that -- and even so, that still won't be enough to offset the loan side pressures?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I mean, if you look, for example, at the time of -- time deposits on Page 15 of 84 basis points, I could just tell you that's way above current posted rates. So as those time deposits mature, it's going to reset at numbers between 5 and 30 basis points probably, depending upon balance and term. And so just out of that -- and there's nothing driving anything else higher on this page right now. So I think you can read -- you should read into that a little bit of continued favorable impact of funding costs. I haven't scheduled it out to see kind of, okay, what is it likely to be if everything just rolls off, but it's been coming down a steady kind of mid- to upper mid-single digits per quarter for quite a while. And probably you'll get mid-single-digit basis points decline in the next couple.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay, great. And then second question, and you had mentioned something in the release about a little bit of a pickup in term CRE in California. I'm wondering how much of that growth in the term bucket is still coming out of the construction bucket? And also just if you can give us a broader comment on what, if any, activity you're starting to see in that CRE side of the portfolio?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Most of it is -- I mean, there is some of it that's maturing construction but most of it is not. I don't know the exact breakdown. And I don't know, Ken or Harris, do you want to add color?", "H. H. Simmons", "I was going to say, it's only $60 million that converted from term -- well from construction in the whole company, not just California, but the whole company was $60 million that converted from construction to term this quarter.", "Kenneth E. Peterson", "And most of the product that we're seeing is in multi-family in California and elsewhere in the CRE spaces.", "H. H. Simmons", "The current CRE spaces.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a broader comment on that, I mean, do you think you're starting to see the turn of commercial real estate? Is there any major change in terms of project interest and refinancings that you're starting to see from at least a interest level or coming in the door type of thing?", "Kenneth E. Peterson", "Major would not be a word I'd use in the sentence. We are seeing some, and anecdotal, a little bit even in single-family, in top areas of Southern California. And we're seeing some apartments in Texas and in California. But there's no major rush to jump into real estate that we're seeing on the demand side.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "And particularly, if you're trying to ask more broadly about office and retail and other items, I would echo what Ken said. There's no...", "Kenneth E. Peterson", "They're one-off opportunities, but again, no major shifts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erika Penala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just actually one question, I know we're close to closing time. But just wanted to follow up on your answer to Ken Zerbe's question on the expenses. So Doyle, you mentioned $15 million should be taken out of the base, when we're thinking about the expense base in 2012. So are we growing for seasonality from $410 million? And if so, what is sort of the progression over the next 3 quarters? I'm guessing that based off of Harris' comments, it's likely flattish from that level, or could you take it down from first quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, again, the other place you're going to -- I would expect you're going to see it continues to come down. There are a couple of lines there, credit-related expenses and OREO expense, which should continue to trend down as problem assets continue to come down. So you almost need to take that out. And ultimately, we'll continue to see some reduction in FDIC insurance premiums, which is another reasonably large item.", "H. H. Simmons", "Yes. The FDIC insurance premium is now risk adjusted. They are risk-rated, as you may know. And it's tied in part to CAMEL ratings. And it's done bank by bank. And we're not saying what our CAMEL ratings are, let me just say that there's room to improve and they are selectively improving. We've had several individual CAMEL ratings change favorably over the last 6 months at various banks. And we expect that based on trends, more of that will happen. And if and as it happens, that, all else being equal, drives -- it will drive a reduction in FDIC. But kind of back to your question, yes, I would think the run rate of which you're starting is closer to probably 410 in the fourth quarter. The number specifically that will go -- will balance up in the first quarter, is salaries and employee benefits. You can kind of look at what happened first quarter last year compared to fourth quarter, it was up from 207 to 215 there on Page 10. A lot of that was due to the fact that everybody's paying FICA and the accruals for that are reset. And then it's tapers off as more and more people hit the salary caps from which FICA is deducted. So you've got -- yes, you're going to have an uptick in salary and benefits. You've got some line items and had some one-offs of them, and then you've got a couple of other line items that should be stable or to trending favorably during the year.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And just remind us on your annual expense base or your current run rate, however you'd want to frame it, how much are you incurring currently in terms of credit-related costs in your operating expense base?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, we tried to break out that on Page 10, Erika. There's in the noninterest expense line, we break out 3 items that are clearly credit-related.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Oh, I see it, I'm sorry. You're right. That was my mistake.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "There's clearly other that's credit-related in salaries and benefits. It's the costs of the work of the people and workout and whatnot. But the intent would be in the salary benefit to -- and we've already done some of this, as the problem loan pile continues to come down, we shifted people 3 years ago from line into workout, and we will be shifting some of those people back from workout into line. But yes, you can see the OREO expense, the other credit-related expenses, these are things like legal fees that are related to credit, appraisals, foreclosure expenses, things of that nature. And then you've got the unfunded lending commitments.", "H. H. Simmons", "As you can see, and the most significant cost pressure, really, other than credit-related has been -- hasn't been regulatory kinds of imperatives, it's been staffing, stress testing, it's been additional compliance people and all the stuff that's coming out of Dodd-Frank, et cetera. It's been consulting costs around getting all of that work done. So we're focused pretty hard at what we can do, including centralizing additional back-office functions. We've done a lot of the heavy lifting there but there's some additional work we are engaged in. And trying very hard to try to slim down where we can.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Patten from Morgan Keegan.", "Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Erika got most of my questions. I guess the other question I was going to ask is, when you say significant drop in charge-offs, you guys have been declining 10 bps a quarter last couple of quarters, and so you were doing significant, I don't know if your definition is the same as mine, but does that mean double, 20 bps?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I don't know, it just means significant. We'll tell you next quarter. If you're thinking in those terms, you're not going to be thinking in the wrong direction.", "Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then one last real quickie. On the C&I, you guys had a couple of hundred million of attrition in the beginning of first quarter. Is your growth view making that $200 million up and then adding to it? Or are you just thinking to get that back to your growth?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I would hopefully probably get that back and maybe add a little to it over the course of the quarter. But we're so early in the quarter and it's hard to know. But if we stayed where we are right now, average loan growth for the quarter would be up more than it was last quarter. ", "All right. With that, I just want to -- before I let James close it, I just want to let everybody know that while we were doing this call, it started snowing. And we had a lot of -- after a very slow start, we had a lot of snow over the weekend and more coming down now. So we hope -- we know many of you, maybe most of you, are planning to come to our investor conference in a few weeks, and look forward to seeing you, and maybe some of you can stay around and enjoy a little of Utah outdoors with us on Friday.", "James R. Abbott", "Thank you, everyone. If you haven't heard about the Investor Day, please feel free to call me or e-mail me and we'll get you on an invitation. And it's on Thursday, February 16. We look forward to seeing you. Thank you, again, and we'll talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program.

This call is being recorded. And now I'll turn the time over to James Abbott. Sir, the floor is yours.", "James R. Abbott", "Thank you, Hewey. Good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our second quarter 2012 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in this press release -- in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Good afternoon, good evening to all of you. Thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter earnings. We were encouraged with a variety of elements of the quarter's results with the exception of the effects of the current interest rate environment on all banks, while things continue to improve. We're pleased with the significant progress with regard to credit quality, virtually all of the major indicators of credit quality continue to improve and did so in a meaningful fashion this quarter.", "We're also able to generate a healthy degree of loan growth, and we can see that continuing in the early innings of the third quarter. And our current expectation is for that growth to continue into the foreseeable future.", "Finally, noninterest expense, as related operations were generally stable. We had a slight increase from the prior quarters, which is ascribable to the provision for unfunded loan commitments, which in turn, is primarily due to an increase in loan commitments by about $400 million during the quarter. And I think that help sets the stage for some further improvement in loan growth and will help to stabilize revenue and eventually to help us increase revenue.", "Offsetting some of the positive news was a decline in net interest income, which was largely expected due to pressures on new loan yields, compared to maturing reprising loan yields. Additionally, the decline in loans late in the first quarter adversely affected net interest income in the second quarter.", "Our guidance has been, for net interest income, to be stable to slightly lower over the course of the year and in the course of the coming year. One of the drivers of growing net interest income will be an improvement in small business lending, which is a-- recently a significant part of what we do.", "The smallest differences in our economy are still reasonably slow to emerge from -- with recession. Some of the indicators of their optimism are flagging somewhat and we're not currently expecting strength in this segment in the third quarter. We were still seeing quite a lot of strength from middle market and larger-sized commercialist borrowers, and some improvement in consumer lending as well.", "I'm encouraged by the improvement in all the major areas of credit risk. As I indicated the -- first of all, nonaccrual and classified loan inflows dropped significantly in the second quarter, a sign that the balance sheets and cash flows of our customers are improving at a healthy pace. Secondly, the past due, nonaccrual and classified loans, other real estate-owned and TDRs all improved materially compared to the prior quarter. It should support our expectation for continued reduction in net charge-offs.", "Finally, net charge-offs declined meaningfully. As you've seen in the release, it fell to an annualized 47 basis points, assisted by both an 8% sequential order decline in gross charge-offs as well as a 19% increase in recoveries.", "Based on the strength of our affiliate banks' earnings, which were an annualized $543 million after-tax in the second quarter and the aforementioned continued improvement in credit quality, we remain quite comfortable about our prospects for redeeming the final $700 million installment of TARP preferred stock in the second half of the year. This will result in further earnings per share savings of about $0.26 annually.", "So with that brief overview, I'm going to turn the time over to our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Doyle Arnold, to review in a little more detail the quarterly performance. Doyle?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thank you, Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. Good evening to those of you on -- in the Eastern Time zone. As noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $55.2 million or $0.30 per diluted common share for the quarter. As we've done in past quarters, we've also presented to you the earnings in a way that excludes the noncash sub debt amortization costs and the FDIC loan discount accretion. We believe this information is useful to longer-term-oriented investors as we don't expect those income and expense items to be with us in the perpetuity. And on that basis, the earnings available to common were $0.40 per share.", "A little more on credit quality. As Harris mentioned, we made strong progress, in the quarter by significantly reducing problem credits, and we expect continued improvement in the second half of the year. As shown on Page 12 of the release, that's one of the tables, page number there in the other upper left corner. Compared to the first quarter, classified loans declined more than 9% as did the nonperforming lending-related assets. Our TDRs declined by more than 8%,  and delinquent accruing loans declined by 14%. The rate -- the ratio of nonperforming lending-related assets fell to 2.5%.  That's quite a declined from 4.1% just a year ago.", "Within the loan categories, as shown on Page 14, it's noteworthy that construction nonaccrual loans have fallen to only $115 million, about half the level of just 6 months ago, and down by 2/3 from a year ago. This is the category that drove about half the company's cumulative credit losses during the last few years, but we're now experiencing a bit of a reversal of fortune there. Problem credits are down, and we're experiencing actual strength in construction origination volumes.", "Note that for the first time in about 4 years, C&D lending was not a drag on net loan growth this quarter, as C&D volumes were flat compared with the prior quarter. We've been suggesting for some time now that we thought that, that would happen around the middle of this year. We're wrong on enough things, and I'll take some pleasure in pointing out that we were right on this one. And we do expect, based on what we're seeing, that we may have hit the bottom in aggregate C&D loans outstanding.", "As Harris mentioned, we're also pleased to report that annualized net charge-offs fell below 50 basis points of average loans for the quarter, and we expect a similar or further -- even a further decline in the next quarter.", "On a related note, the $11 million provision or about $0.04 a share was roughly similar to the prior quarter's provision and was within the band of our expectations. Despite the improvement in our own portfolio credit metrics, we continue to exercise caution with regard to the appropriate level of the loan loss allowance, given the ongoing weakness both in Europe and in as exhibited by numerous U.S. macroeconomic indicators in recent months that have mostly consistently been coming in weaker or below expectations.", "Within the noninterest expense line, you'll see the provision for unfunded lending commitments was a positive $4.9 million compared to a negative $3.7 million last quarter. That's a swing of about $0.02 a share, a negative impact on EPS. But the primary reason for the difference was a strong increase in mid-loan commitments for the second quarter. The commitment growth in the second quarter was skewed toward loans that should experience significant draws over the next several months in higher utilization rates. Therefore, while this provision for unfunded lending commitments was a near-term negative earnings this quarter, we're optimistic with the long-term outlook for revenue generation from this factor over the next few quarters.", "Moving on to other revenue drivers. We were reasonably pleased with the amount of loan growth, and it was relatively broad-based. Geographically, 6 of the 8 affiliate banks increased loans outstanding, most of them to a meaningful degree. Pricing on new and renewed loans did compress somewhat again this quarter. However, the spread over mass maturity costs of fund is still within the range of historical norms. It's roughly similar to what we saw in 2006, 2007.", "Let me take a couple of minutes and run through some growth statistics on a few of the banks as we typically get a few questions about this in the Q&A session anyway.", "Starting with Zions Bank, which covers Utah and Idaho, loans grew in the aggregate of nearly $100 million, driven by C&I and term CRE, partially offset by the continued planned decline in owner occupied and construction and development in this market.", "California Bank & Trust experienced healthy growth in more than $70 million, which included growth in C&I, municipal, residential mortgage and construction. Again, partially offset by owner-occupied declines and the ongoing reductions in the loans acquired with FDIC from failed banks, which continues to proceed at pace.", "Our National Bank of Arizona affiliate experienced strong loan growth of more than $45 million, again with growth in C&I. But there are also some growth in owner-occupied and residential mortgage, partially offset in Arizona by a decline in term CRE.", "In Amegy, which is, the preponderance of which is in Houston and some Dallas and San Antonio exposure, experienced growth of more than $30 million, occurring to earning an owner-occupied leasing residential mortgage, partially offset by a decline in C&I construction and term CRE.", "Moving into loan growth by product type on Page 11 of the earnings release, I'll highlight a couple of trends. Overall, despite some ups and downs that I just mentioned, C&I loans increased 2% sequentially, and have continued to grow through the first 3 weeks of the third quarter.", "Pricing on our C&I production narrowed compared to prior quarters when we're generally holding our credit underwriting standards firm. Although in some markets or product types, there's been some softening in some elements such as extending length of maturity.", "Within C&I and owner-occupied loans, both of which are underwritten with the cash flows of the business as the primary source of repayment, we've seen the strongest growth within the mining and energy industries, while construction-related -- while C&I loans related to construction activity and companies within the consumer goods and services interest -- industries have declined.", "As we've discussed in the past, the decline in owner-occupied loan portfolio is largely attributable to decisions made several quarters ago as a part of our concentration and risk management efforts to selectively reduce  certain aspects of our exposure in our National Real Estate business. Much of this is the SBA 504 loan product. We expect several hundred million dollars of further contraction in this portfolio before it stabilizes, and expect that stabilization will occur some time around mid-2013. This attrition will pressure the overall trend in owner-occupied loans. For a more comprehensive discussion on this, you can refer to the transcript from last quarter's call or our last quarter's 10-Q.", "Construction and development loans were flat compared to the prior quarter, and we actually do expect some growth in this category over the next several quarters. As previously booked, new construction commitments began to fund as construction commences. Most of the new construction loan commitments are in Class A apartment buildings.", "Single-family residential development project in some markets, particularly, coastal Southern California are strengthening and our commitments are now growing. Although, relative to historical growth rates we have described, demand for such loans is relatively modest at this point. Pricing on the C&D production has been fairly stable over the last 6 months.", "Term CRE loans declined modestly, driven by paydowns and pay-offs, while new production volume also increased modestly. Within the category, pricing narrowed at our largest banks.", "Multifamily lending continues to be the largest growth category or strongest growth category, up to about 10% annualized growth in the last 6 months. Industrial properties have also enjoyed strong growth, but remain a small element of our portfolio.", "Term CRE loans collateralized by hotel and land continue to decline, down about 15% and nearly 30%, respectively, on an annualized basis.", "Within consumer lending, residential first mortgages grew nearly 15% annualized in the quarter, and this growth was pretty widespread geographically. Pricing narrowed about 25 basis points on production, but that's approximately in line with industry pricing compression due to the pretty well-publicized decline in longer-term rates.", "Turning to the margin. On Page 15, we'll note that the GAAP NIM compressed by 11 basis points, while the core NIM declined by 9 basis points. As a reminder, the core net interest margin address -- adjusts for items such as the sub debt conversion, expenses and accretion on acquired loans as reconciled on Page 16 of the release. About 6 basis points of the core NIM compression was due to the issuance of senior debt late in the first quarter, which was on the books there for all of the second and additional debt issuances in the second quarter. Subsequently, depositing net cash in low-yielding short-duration cash accounts namely, our Fed account, with the anticipation that we will use that cash for TARP redemption later this year.", "The loan yield compression of 10 basis points from -- to 5.07% from 5.17% last quarter in both cases, excluding FDIC-supported loans, were attributable to the same factors we've discussed in the past, which are one, adjustable rate loans resetting to lower rates as the repricing index is lower than it was several years ago, generally 5 years ago when the loans were booked; and two, maturing loans, many of which had rate floors are replaced with new loans that lower coupons -- or lower floors compared to loans originated when spread were higher.", "Yield on the loan portfolio compressed a bit more than in the prior quarters due in part to the pricing competition on commercial loans and a slight mix shift towards lower-yielding residential mortgage loans held for assessment.", "We estimate that the net interest margin will be undergoing pressure due to these forces -- undergoing -- will be on under ongoing pressure due to these forces, assuming a static balance sheet. There are additional factors that drive NIM compression and expansion, of course. For example, in the third quarter, there'll be incremental pressure from the debt issuance during the second quarter, which will be on the books most of this quarter, if not all of it, as well as some added pressure from higher prepayment speeds from longer-term loan products such as residential mortgages or resets to lower rates, on adjustable rate loans.", "It's worth noting that Zions' residential mortgage portfolio is about half the concentration of the industry, thereby reducing, but not eliminating prepayment risk. Additionally, while we've talked about this repeatedly at various conferences, I again remind you, we have the smallest relative exposure to mortgage-backed securities of all regional banks.", "Potential offsets to margin compression would be loan growth, as we would simply use available cash currently on deposited of Federal Reserve to fund the loans. Some continued reduction in the cost of interest-bearing deposits, which declined 4 basis points this quarter. Also TARP repayment would reduce cash assets by $700 million, thereby lifting the margin itself by about 4 basis points, as well as reducing the drag from preferred dividends, as Harris mentioned earlier.", "Finally, our balance sheet remains quite asset-sensitive. We're in upward parallel shift in the yield curve of 200 basis points. We would estimate to have a positive effect on net interest income by more than 10%.", "Turning briefly now to noninterest income. On Page 10, there are 2 items worth highlighting. Other service charges, commissions and fees increased about $4 million from the prior quarter. We believe that this quarter's rate was closer to a run rate. The prior quarter's level was low because of relatively low loan origination volume, which as we noted, has increased this quarter. And the increase in second quarter is almost entirely due to the higher origination and lower loan referral volumes this quarter.", "Our current expectation is for the second half of the year, new originations based on pipelines that we see should be similar to, or if not, exceed the second quarter's volumes. So this fee income line should remain relatively strong.", "Dividends and other investment income increased primarily due to several small gains from various equity investments including private equity fund investments in Amegy, and which in turn, were primarily attributable to the energy sector. Such equity returns are and will continue to be volatile.", "Just a few points on capital. GAAP tangible common equity, was essentially unchanged at 6.9%. The common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to an estimated 9.77% from 9.71% in the prior quarter. Regarding Basel III ratios under the proposed rule published a month or so ago, and which is still out for comment, there are several new provisions in that rule, which may reduce our fully phased-in estimate for common equity Tier 1 to a bit below 8%, maybe 7.75% area, as investment bankers would say. It's a bit lower than our previous estimates of around 8.2%, but the changes primarily impacting us relate to unfunded commitments less than 1.5 years receiving a risk weight. The risk weight increasing on past due, nonaccrual loans and some of the change -- changes in the treatment of 1-4 family residential mortgages.", "Given some of the uncertainties around what the final rule will look like, we'll probably not going to publish a firm estimate of that common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in until the rules are final, but to give you a bit of guidance, we think something under 8%, probably in the 7.75% area is a reasonable estimate at this time.", "Guidance for the next few quarters, and we'll wrap up and turn to your questions. Loan growth, as we have said a couple of times on the call, we expect moderate organic loan growth in the second half of the year, perhaps somewhat stronger than the first half certainly, but perhaps even a bit stronger than that of the second quarter.", "Net interest income, we expect to decline somewhat in the second half due to the previously discussed debt issuance and loan yield compression. We do not anticipate purchasing a large quantity of bulk loans or securities to enhance the net interest income in the near term. We have purchased a small amount of securities in an attempt to prevent our assets sensitivity from growing even larger. Philosophically, we continue to view the associated interest rate risk to be asymmetrical, and note that convexity risk can destroy equity just as well as credit risk if rates rise significantly.", "Furthermore, with the Basel III rules on AOCI affecting regulatory capital ratios, the costs of convexity risk is even higher than previous rising rate cycles unless we'd like to avoid that.", "OTTI on the securities portfolio, in general, it should remain low as fewer banks are failing. More are recovering, including deferring banks resume -- resuming payments of trust preferred dividends. Our models has been quite conservative at predicting failures. Offsetting the trend maybe faster bank prepayments of trust preferred securities, which as we have described before, diverse cash into the senior tranches that we own, potentially improving AOCI and generating fixed income gains, but removes future cash flow from the mezzanine tranches, which potentially results in additional OTTI.", "We expect the net effect of these 2 trends to be accretive to tangible common equity over time, although they may not perfectly offset each other in the same quarter. Some of you have inquired about the section within the Fed's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that disqualifies trust preferred as Tier 1 capital for small banks, as well as the Dodd-Frank required exclusion for banks $15 billion or greater in size. If the rule is adapted as currently as proposed, we believe it probably would result in some increase in prepayments fees, which would theoretically result in higher OTTI, but an improved AOCI mark, which would be net accretive to our capital ratios and book value per share. However, we do not expect all banks to redeem their trust preferred as a result of this rule because for some, given current conditions, it may be for a time at least relatively inexpensive Tier 2 capital even as it no longer qualifies for Tier 1. So to give you more firm guidance there, we'll have to wait for the final rule of the phase-in period and actual observable behavior on the part of these banks.", "Noninterest expense in the near-term should be generally stable, perhaps slightly lower driven, again, primarily by credit cost improvement in the credit expense line that we've broken out for you in that section.", "Provision expense, we expect to remain low, continued reduction in problem credits and the ongoing improvement in loss severity rates continues to have a potential to result in the negative provision in some quarters, but loan growth may offset this.", "And finally, our preferred stock dividends in the near term, I'd remind those of you building your models, that we expect to redeem the remaining $700 million of TARP preferred stock either in the late -- late in the third or in the fourth quarter. This event, when it occurs, will trigger a onetime accretion of the discount related to warrants that was associated with the TARP.", "As of June 30, the rate remaining discount was $17 million, which will be recorded as a preferred dividend in the quarter, in which we do repay TARP. The regular TARP dividend embedded in the preferred stock dividend in the second quarter was $12 million from the $700 million of TARP remaining, and that would be eliminated upon redemption. Aside from TARPn effects, the deferred stock dividend would decline slightly in the third quarter due to the redemption of our Series E preferred, which had an 11% coupon and replacing it with the new Series F, which has a 7.9% coupon.", "With that, operator, if you would open up the line for questions. We will try to respond to them for the next 30 minutes or so.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first questioner in queue is Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just curious with the challenge in growing net interest income over the next several quarters, what the primary levers you see to grow earnings are, exclusive of provisioning going forward.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I think the preferred dividend that I mentioned is probably the biggest single change that will occur over the next couple of quarters. Aside from that, it's going to just be continued basic blocking and tackling and striving for loan growth. There are no magic levers to pull. We have to be disciplined about deposit pricing, aggressive about contacting customers and potential customers, but also disciplined after loans, but also disciplined about pricing those loans. I don't think there any silver bullets out there.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "You sensed that you guys are being relatively more disciplined in terms of loan pricing than some of the competitors you're going up against for the last several months.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I would say we've tried to be disciplined, but it's darn hard. And you have to -- at some point, you have to meet the competition for good quality loans for customers you have or being calling on for a long period of time. So I think we're doing what we have to do to retain market share and very selectively grow. We're trying not to discount loans just for the sake of achieving a lot of loan growth.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue is from Steven Alaba (sic) [Steven Alexopoulos] with JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to start, regarding the pro forma Tier 1 Doyle gave, the 7.75% under the new rules. When you look at the rules and think about what you could do between now and when the rule's get adopted, I know they might change. How much worth of room do you think you have to improve Tier 1, right? You might be able to little change where you do a commitment, et cetera. Just wondering if you could band what that might look like.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, the phase-in period is relatively long, and the biggest single impact is one we've talked about, it's nothing new. It's been in the kind of the proposal, the Basel committee itself without, and that's the AOCI. As it -- and that's, by far, the biggest single impact in the change from Basel I rules to Basel III rules for us. And as we discussed, all the trends in -- that we're seeing in the CDO portfolio would suggest that the AOCI mark should moderate over the next few quarters and through the years during the phase-in period. So there's a lot that can happen between where we are now and the full phase-in rule with regard to that number. Similarly, the deferred tax asset that requires future profitability towards realization, which is much, much smaller than the AOCI mark rule gets smaller as basically as NOL carryforwards are used up. And as we remain profitable, that too should happen. With regard to, I guess, the other thing -- the next bigger ones and one of the newer ones is the change in the risk weightings on basically nonperforming loans. And as those continue to come down, the impact of that number should come down. The 2 that probably are subject to a little more management discretion are kind of what we do in the way with residential mortgages and with unfunded commitments. You certainly don't want to stop making commitments but it -- one might look at the pricing of those commitments that are under a year. And with regard to residential mortgage, we have some unique -- I wouldn't say they're unique, but we have some products here that we think are very conservatively underwritten that get caught up in the full amortization rules that get them into a higher risk weight bucket. We need to look at those products, and how we price of them or design them to see if with some tweaks, they're still good products that have less risk-weighted impact. But we haven't started to do that yet. It's too [indiscernible].  Is that helpful?", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, that's actually really helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Looking at the core loan yields down around 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, given the competitive environment, is this the quarterly pressure we should be thinking about? And maybe can you talk about where your loans were added in the portfolio in the quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes. I mean that's probably reasonably reflective of what we're seeing out there. The -- and we've talked about the kind of the ongoing pressures of -- it's harder to get floors that margins over -- or spreads over indices have been under some pressure. That's -- it's probably realistic to think that, that loan yield will -- that, that's a new benchmark, but that further decline should layer because those can take -- those pressures continue to impact each quarter's new production or resets as in order. Now, I went to quite a lot of detail in the prepared remarks about where the loan growth came from and by loan type and by geography. Was there a specific area that you wanted to focus on? Or if it was a more general question, maybe you can follow up with James afterwards, so I don't repeat all of that.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No, I was just thinking, Doyle, on the blended basis is where you're adding new loans into the portfolio today.", "Harris H. Simmons", "One thing I have noticed, I mentioned the fact that smaller business loans -- I mean, we're just not seeing a growth there, than what we're seeing in some of the larger deals. The larger deals tend to have skimmed the pricing. So I think to the extent that we see a pick-up on the smaller end of the market that, that should incrementally help us grow.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "And I would just add, Steve, as well on that topic is with -- on the C&I , which is about half of our production volume, the large loans priced about 75 to 100 basis points thinner than the small business loans. So you're getting some difference in quality, maybe a borrower has got a more diversified business model, but pricing is fewer on the pricing side.", "Operator", "Next question in queue is John Pancari with Evercore Partners.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "In terms of your margin outlook, I know you implied some incremental pressure here, I guess along the lines of the loan yield color you just commented on, is it fair to assume that, to help quantify that margin pressure that we should assume that it could be close to what you saw this quarter for the next couple of quarters?", "Harris H. Simmons", "On the loan yields?", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "The impact on the overall margin.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, the floor, the kind of the minimum that we see is about 5 basis points, and that's just due to the rate resets and the expiration of floors. So it's not going to be less than that for the next several quarters. And probably what we saw this quarter is about the upper bound if that's just a guess, that's somewhere between 5 and 10 for the overall weighted average.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Again, one thing that probably we should clarify here is, is when we're talking about this, we're talking on a static balance basis. So if the balance sheet, if we get loans by $300 million or $400 million in the third quarter, that will have an offsetting effect of that. But on just a static balance basis, we would expect about 5 basis points of yield compression on the loan portfolio in  the third quarter, assuming no production whatsoever. So the new production will come on and have an incremental effect.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "To get to the overall margin, there are a number of things we -- I think for 6 quarters now probably one or more of you have been asking us when are you going to hit the bottom on deposit pricing. Well, we still managed to lower the cost of deposits 4 basis points this quarter and there's probably still a bit more to go. We -- the kind of the buildup of debt and cash associated with stockpiling money to repay TARP is an unusual effect that will go away in, late this quarter or in the fourth quarter when we do repay TARP. So I don't want you to come away with a focus on loan pricing, and get 5 to 10 basis points, and say that's the margin compression. There's going to be margin compression, but it's -- there are offsetting and other factors besides that.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about where you see your normalized loan loss reserve level falling out? I mean you're at 270 basis points right now relative to the loan book. So can you just give us a little bit of color on how much more downside you see there?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "If I knew the -- what the accounting rules and the regulatory rules were going to be 3 years from now, I'd give you a pretty good idea. But I don't know and none of us knows, and you don't know. So it's a question that has no answer. I know you want to know it, but those who are giving you an answer, I think, are making one up, because I don't know how to answer the question. All I can tell you is that we're going to be cautious, and I wake up every morning and see what's going on in Europe and I -- 6:30 on CNBC, the latest economic indicator comes out, and it's not good. And yet, everything we see in our portfolio says every day in every way things are getting better and better to coin a phrase, or actually steal someone else's -- a 19th century French psychologist. So I don't know the answer to the question. I can't give you a number. Make one up, I won't make it up for you. But I don't see why were going to be different than anybody else, long-term. So whatever you're assuming for other regional banks with reasonable credit discipline,  assume the same for us.", "Operator", "Our next question in our queue is Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about what kind of activity you're seeing in your regions? Some CEOs -- I would say the majority of the CEOs over the last week are talking about they saw a material slowdown in activity on loan demand towards the end of the quarter. Are you experiencing the same thing? I know you are different, geography wise, but just wondering how do you're -- how do you see it shaping up?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think it seems to be the contrary. We've actually been seeing probably some improvement for the last, the last couple of months, and so far in this quarter. And it's pretty broad-based. So I mean, I think some of the improvement you saw earlier on over the course of the last year was, perhaps, a little heavily weighted toward banks in the upper Midwest, et cetera, where there was maybe a little heavier manufacturing activity. That is probably slowing a little bit right now. And that maybe coloring some of the very recent results, and some things you're hearing from some of those funders. But you're -- in the West, we are seeing a generally, pretty much across-the-board improvement in film [ph] that we saw an improvement in line utilization. For the first time, we're seeing a couple of percentage point uptick this quarter in utilization of lines. And so it's still -- it's hardly -- it doesn't have the strength that we've maybe historically seen, but we think that it's still good for sort of the mid- to maybe and a little higher than mid-single-digit growth here in the second half of the year. So we are not at this moment seeing any slowing.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And can it -- I mean you said you say more broad-based, but well you know California's still struggling a little bit. Were you seeing, also, activity out of California also?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, we're seeing good activity in California. We're seeing better growth in a market like Colorado than we've seen in quite some time. We're seeing it, really, in almost every geography with the exception of Nevada, was pretty flat. We're even seeing it in  markets like Arizona.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I'll just go ahead and follow on California. We had over $100 million if you exclude the FDIC-supported loans which declined, and if you exclude that, we actually had over $100 million worth of net loan growth in California. Like Doyle said earlier, it's mostly the coastal regions which is where we, where our footprint is, but it's not a terrible economy.", "Operator", "Our next question now in queue is Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess just first, just given where your pro forma Basel III capital levels should be under the NPR. I understand that this is just a proposal and you could obviously change your stance. But does this at all impact your ability to get out of TARP without issuing equity? And I guess longer-term, when you think about returning capital, do you think this will concern -- this will serve as a constraint in terms of your ability to do so?", "Harris H. Simmons", "First part of your question was does this impact our ability to exit TARP, we certainly don't think so. And I've reiterated a couple of times on the call our expectation that we will do so probably late third quarter or sometime in the fourth quarter. And there are no new conditions to that other than the ones we articulated at the time we announced the results of our, kind of our capital plan. In terms of capital distributions longer-term, We -- I assume you're talking about share buybacks and dividends and things like that as capital distributions. What I would point you to is that we have -- we have planned to -- a number of things that we want to do over the next 2 years in the way of reducing our cost of capital, and our cost of funding, which when added together -- we suggest that could kind of double the ROE of the company over that time frame. That's our primary focus for the next couple of years rather than massively distributing common equity anyway. We've never talked aggressively about that. And so no, I don't think it has -- certainly it hasn't caused us to have an OMG moment that we've got to do some massive change to our thinking. I'd also say, as I've pointed out in response to an earlier question, there's reason to believe that the size of that change should moderate quite substantially over the next year or 2.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's fair. And then I guess just in terms of the excess liquidity position, with, I guess with talk of the extension of the TAG Program, the Fed potentially on hold until, looks like late 2014 and if we are to get cuts to IOER, should all these things happen, would you consider changing the stance on redeploying some of the excess liquidity in the near term, and, okay, I guess this question may [indiscernible] if you just have the number at hand, how much of the $7.9 billion of interest-bearing cash do guys to the Fed right now?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Generally -- today, I don't know. But in general the Fed account has been running at $7 billion to $7.6 billion on any given night, kind of in that range. I'm not sure what you're referring to about extension of the TAG Program, and...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well I think, if it were extended, would we change our thinking?", "Harris H. Simmons", "I think the answer is probably not really. I mean, if you think the real question is, are you going to go out and dramatically lengthen the duration of your equity account and accrue the risk that, that entails at some point down the road when we expect to rise. And I think we're going to be likely to be losing the discipline between now and maybe if line clings a little, but not -- I don't think materially, as we said, Doyle said during his remarks, we change what we -- the risk there is asymmetric. And that we just don't get paid very much for extensions right now, so...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "You're the first -- I must have missed something. I didn't know there was any recent talk about TAG Program extension.", "Harris H. Simmons", "There's been some chatter about it, but no...", "Ryan M.

Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just one follow-up on the liquidity question. I mean, and conversely instead of extending, is there anything that you could do to, kind of, I don't know, just extend some of that cash from staying on the balance sheet in order to save some on NIM and even preserve capital from -- I know it's not a risk-weighting problem, but just from an equity perspective. I mean, I guess the broader question is, if you're not going to be reinvesting it, and some of it hopefully will remix into loans over time, is there anything that you can do to just maximize the capacity of the balance sheet, and how you're earning on it?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, we've already taken some action by some of our banks to basically work with their -- some of their very largest depositors to -- with their permission, sweep balances off our balance sheet. We've probably gotten $1 billion to $2 billion of that. We've -- for all intents and purposes, probably exited broker deposits. I think there are a couple hundred million left of residual, but they're -- that's down from several billion and it's on way to essentially 0. We continue to price non-relationship CDs at essentially 0, like 5 or 10 basis points. And so if you're -- if that's all you're here for, please don't come here. We give them a little bit more of their checking account or other customer, but we're trying to shrink, and you've seen we have shrunk some of the, the CD portfolio, as well as the money market portfolio. So yes, we're doing everything that we can think of to reduce those excess deposits without actually chasing out of the company good, long-term customers. And --", "Harris H. Simmons", "We have thought about coaching tellers to be surly. [indiscernible] very posed we can because we, I mean we've recognized that we've got a lot of excess liquidity. We just have a tough time figuring out where to put it about having disproportionate risk, the downside in the rising rate.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And my second question is just on the RWA question. Doyle, I understand that you mentioned it was mostly related to the commitments and then just small related to mortgage. Can you talk about any impact it had, positive or negative, on the TruPS book and the swap? And how, if anything, in the NPR changes your view around the swap on that portfolio, how it works and your ability to continue to use it?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I don't think there was anything in the proposal other than the phase out of Tier 1 qualifying capital for small banks, which I've discussed, one should have an impact on our portfolio over time. It's hard to quantify. That it doesn't have an impact on the risk-weighted, of assets. We -- I think our -- the previous estimates that we published pretty well incorporated what we think are the impact on CE T-1, Common Equity Tier 1 from the AOCI mark there. The swap, the total return swap, we discussed that several times a quarter, and we've reached no firm conclusion. I think the -- we will look at the final rules regarding -- that eliminate the use of rating agency ratings for regulatory purposes and what classified assets look like under that final rule. It's, I think supposed to be out this quarter, and we can -- and it will be a combination of looking at what the risk-based capital ratios look like, what the classified ratios look like and what the -- and the cost the TRS. I will remind you that in the non-hedged derivative income, the bulk of that negative number there is the quarterly cost of that TRS, which is a little over $5 million, pretax. So we haven't made any decisions with regard to it yet, but I think we'll, over the next few quarters as these changes become -- to asset risk ratings tied into classifieds in particular, we'll be looking at the TRS very seriously, as it may -- and I'm not foreshadowing anything. Obviously, we'll have to take a hard look at quantifying all of those impacts.", "Operator", "Next question in our queue is Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Though it seems like you guys are pretty much well on your way to retain the second half of TARP, can you just give us a rundown when you look at your TARP repayment checklist, what still has to be done, kind of how much progress have you made. I guess I'm thinking specifically of at least the -- and I think it's roughly $50 million of debt that you may or may not have to issue from here, that I don't think you hit your full $600 million. And then based on how much capital's already been paid out from the bank's subs and what you expect in third quarter?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yes, we're -- I think you said well on our way to meeting those conditions, and I will agree with that. Yes, there were essentially 3 conditions that we proposed, by the way, and the Fed accepted. One is that we want to issue $600 million of term senior debt as a way to achieve part of the funding. We have issued, as you pointed out round numbers $550 million. We expect to view into this, I think, at $554 million that we've issued. Approximately $558 million anyway. $558 million. We'll be issuing, I think we'll be issuing the rest of that this quarter. The second was that he would get at least $500 million in a combination of common and preferred dividends and redemptions of preferred stock that push in the that we -- that the parent had provided to the subsidiary banks. As of June 30, we were in the neighborhood of $450 million, and I expect to actually to get several hundred million more this quarter. So probably -- and those 2 items were critical to having enough cash at the parent after repaying TARP, repaying the TLGP debt, to have a pretty lengthy time for required funding. The third condition was, I believe it was characterized in our the press release is something like no material deterioration in the condition or outlook of the company. And certainly there's been no material deterioration in the condition as the outlook we proposed that we would give the Fed a -- an updated stress test, just a forward-looking view of capital, which we are in the process of doing and expect to submit in the first half of August for their review. I -- based on everything I've seen, it's -- and expect to see, it will show better results than what we submitted at year-end. So I do believe that by assuming regulatory permission for the preferred stock redemptions that we will be in a position again late this quarter. And if that permission is just delayed due to review in timing, sometime early in the fourth quarter to meet all of those conditions.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And if you get several hundred million more of capital from the banks' subs, do you have to raise the 42? Or can you just essentially ask regulators to let you swap the form of capital that's at the holding company?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I could -- the plan was to raise $600 million. There's -- in this day and age, there's probably a limited number of things you want to go back and ask the regulators to change. And I'd rather -- I'd -- for that amount of money, I'd rather just march to the drummer that's beating right now and get it done. I mean, we have $50 million more maturing in the fourth quarter.", "Our short-term senior notes, if we really want to, we can make it up that way.

On a slide there, on Page 15 of the release, I just noticed that securities portfolio yields did expand during the quarter. I guess can you talk about, was there anything that you guys did to sort of extend the duration a little bit there, just maybe you could talk about the...?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Brian, that was a good question. That was actually mostly a nonrecurring item. There was a security, a trust preferred security a single issue, trust preferred security that came current. So this fits into the same category the CDOs are getting healthier. But these weren't CDOs, this was a single issue, and there was about $1.5 million catch-up on deferred interest that we had not capitalized previously. So we caught up and that won't be as large next quarter. So they'll continue to pay us, but there won't be a $1.5 million catch-up.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "So they may have exacerbated the [indiscernible] bucket?", "Harris H. Simmons", "AFS.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it looks like the ATM HDM may be smaller, but that actually had a yield expansion as well?", "Unknown Executive", "I didn't research that one because it wasn't terribly significant, but I'd be happy to do so.", "Operator", "Next question in queue is Josh Levin with Citigroup.", "Arjun Sharma", "This is actually Arjun Sharma on the line for Josh. Just my first question is one of your peers said that they're going to close roughly 5% of their branches. So do you -- as you think about the environment, are branch closings or infrastructure cuts on the horizon?", "Harris H. Simmons", "We have closed actually a number of branches over the last 3 or 4 years. And I expect -- yes, you will continue to see some branch closures. We've also opened a handful, but net-net, we're down roughly 45 or so branches, I think, in the last 4 years. So I would expect for the next 12 months that we'll see a handful, but we don't have, by and large, especially outside of the state of Utah, the kind of branch density that some other banks have that gives us quite the same luxury of being able to combine  as previously as some banks have been able to. So we're getting to a point where it's getting tougher, but we're still finding some opportunities do that, yes.", "Operator", "Next question in queue is Dave Rochester, Deutsche Bank.", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just drilling down into the C&I growth this quarter, did any of the pick-up in production come from your getting more competitive in the larger corporate arena, or was that primarily small business?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Well, we talked about the fact that small business was generally the remainder of, relatively weaker. So the growth probably net-net or I don't think we've had time to drill down inventory completely, was probably in the more medium-sized to larger commercial activity.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That is true, and I would syndicate it if underneath there is a question about syndicated credits or purchased loans. We didn't see any of that. Really, syndicated credit exposure is not materially different than it was last quarter on a net basis. A lot of the C&I growth, or at least acceleration in production came out of Utah and California, and it was relatively stable in Texas. So -- and it was out of the larger corporate -- or not larger, but maybe middle-market is what would be a more fair characterization.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue is Joe Morford with RBC.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Obviously just trying to understand the $11 million provision this quarter. I know you saw a little bit of loan growth, but classifieds were down another 9% and charge-offs were up 20%. Is it really just a subjective factor of wanting to be more cautious given the macro environment?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That's pretty much it.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Well, I think we're just -- we were trying to be pretty conservative. I think we, Joe, our view is there's still quite a lot of risk out there. I mean, we certainly see it and all the things you're hearing from the Fed. The fact that they're even thinking about for the [indiscernible] and et cetera, suggests that, we think -- they think the -- that the world remains a slow place and a risky place. And so we're likely to remain reasonably, conservatively -- we certainly have methodology in place. And we try to assess some of these factors but, which result in our being probably reasonably conservative right now relative to our peers in terms of forward keeping reserves.", "Operator", "Steve Scinicariello with UBS.", "Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Hey everyone, just a real quick one for you. Just given the progress you guys have made in delayering the capital structure this year with TARP and the Series C preferreds, how likely is it that you're going to be able to get at the 8% trust preferreds for this year, or is that kind of more on the 2013 to-do list?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, the trust preferred was not in our capital plan that we -- as a part of the stress test last year. So and we're far enough along into the year that there's no point in submitting a formal new capital plan because we'll be -- so I think we'll deal with that one and the stress test and capital plan at the end of this year. And I'll remind you, we have that, and we have the call option coming up in September on this -- on the very large Series C 9.5% preferred issue. I think there's a bit over $800 million in that issue which is callable.", "Harris H. Simmons", "That's September of 2013.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Right.", "Operator", "Next question in our queue is Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just kind of a follow-up, Doyle, as we about -- as we're about to conclude this journey on the TARP fund, if you will, just trying to get a sense, kind of as we look out the next couple of years, a, kind of targeted mix in terms of your capital structure and b, if you can give us a sense with the debt that's has been issued, the preferred, and so forth, as they roll off, just kind of a step function that we should think about over the next couple of years as some of this rolls off, and you kind of reach your targeted mix, if you will, from a capital standpoint, or structure standpoint as you say?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, Todd, I guess, in the interest of time, I think we've tried to address that in our recent IR presentations. We -- if there is plenty of time, we've put out a pretty comprehensive list of what capital issues are callable, what debt issues mature and basically there's just about everything out there that, except what we did this year with the Series F is now addressable in 2013, '14 or a little bit of it in 2015. There's some sub debt there. So everything on that list that's high cost at the time that comes up is going to be fair game for refinancing or calling and partially replacing. We've also put out some guidance on what our current thinking is about a long-term capital and financing structure. But the long-term has to be revisited just about every quarter in these days as new capital NPRs come out and things like that. But I think it's still reasonably operative that we're going to be kind of 9.5% -- 9% to 10% common equity Tier 1 long-term that we're likely to have a 1.5% -- 1% to 2% preferred, some Tier 2, or which one of, maybe 2% of Tier 2, which was -- includes the sub debt and 2% or 3% of risk rate assets in the form of senior debt. And I can't probably get any more specific now, but we've tried to lay that out and everything we do is in terms of looking at the things that become callable or mature, we're going to try to then figure out what the new issue ought to do and moving toward that longer-term structure.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "No, I appreciate that. And then that's very helpful. I was just getting at the point that I realized you've put a lot of information out there in terms of maturity. It's just really in terms of what the puts and takes as it relates to your debt structure now, I'm just trying to get a, more of a sense of, again, longer-term from a funding standpoint, how much of this really needs to be replaced as opposed to just kind of a burn or run-through rate as we again, as we go through the TARP repayment process?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I think that overall -- the repayment of TARP is a net reduction of Tier 1 capital by that amount. There's probably not that much more to reduce maybe a little bit after that, because there's a matter of cash and capital. I think that the bigger opportunity is the refinancing of a lot of the stuff that's substantially lower cost. Look at what our long-term senior debt is costing us on Page 15. It's kind of 11.25%. That's a combination of mark-to-market discounts and new issuance discounts. That -- and look at what we're issuing debt -- term senior debt for it today. It's in the 4 -- it's got a 4 handle on it. There is a pickup there of 6% or 7% potentially on long-term debt over the next few years. Preferred at 9.5%, we could do probably 7%, plus or minus today, so and for -- maybe the 6%s. So it's more going to be replaced not reduced. I think we ought to take that next question now.", "Operator", "Next question in the queue is Marty Mosby, Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Doyle, just a quick question on the CDO portfolio. There's only really 3 tranches and $72 million of par value that would be left that can have some credit impairment that's already in some trouble. Can you just figure this out, maybe not the next couple of quarters, but in 2013, it seems some of that overhang in the OTI that comes due every quarter to start and work its way out? And that was my only question.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes. The short answer I think, yes. Unless there is a very sharp deterioration in the, kind of go back in a higher rate of bank failures and deferrals and whatnot, again the only thing that I can see that's going to cause -- could cause a significant pick-up in OTTI temporarily with the significant acceleration of prepayments, which would be generally accompanied also by an improvement in AOCI. So yes, you could see some income statement impact from that. But the capital accretion would more than offset the income statement impact. So in general, again, I -- absent a severe downturn, I think, net-net the improvement's there, and we'll see an end it.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Jeff Navarro with Lord Abbett.", "Unknown Analyst", "Just quick, apologize. You guys have been adamant about the short duration on what the cash being parked there, but given the world we're all having to deal with unfortunately this lower for longer environment, how much pain, I guess, are you guys willing to endure before not to do anything crazy or dramatic, but just kind of on the margin maybe, or is this just how you see the world?", "Harris H. Simmons", "I'm not going to say never, particularly to what I am seeing on the margin. I mean we've entertained some things that we -- could lead to modest improvement without taking -- I mean the thing that I think -- I think the things that we're going to be willing to endure a lot of torture over are things that are going to have large conventional risk in a rising rate environment. If we defined things with defined maturities with reasonably bounded credit risk, even if we're not originating it, we might do it. We are mindful, for example, I'll just give you one example kind of and then we'll need to cut it off. We are mindful of the fact that the European banks are under enormous pressure to improve capital ratios, reduce funding needs and which means looking at assets to sell, and in this environment what you can sell or your better assets, not your worst assets. So we are looking at things that might be shed by people who are under some degree of stress, and maybe we'll find something there. We've actually looked pretty seriously at a couple of things, but haven't pulled the trigger on anything yet. But I would put that in your on-the-margin kind of comment.", "With that, I think, we need to call it a day. James, do you want to -- we appreciate your the indulgence in going over time, and sorry about that for those of you on the East. James?", "James R. Abbott", "Thank you very much, and I'll be around tonight and please free to e-mail me, and I'll call you back in the order that I receive the email, or you can try to call me, I'll be happy take the call as well. Thank you again for your time. We'll see you sometime throughout the quarter during -- in conference season. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, gentlemen.

And welcome to the Zions Bancorporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference may be recorded. And now, my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. James Abbott. Sir, the floor is yours.", "James R. Abbott", "Thank you, Hewey, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2012 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Thank you very much, James, and welcome to all of you. We're reasonably encouraged with the third quarter's results, with many of the metrics improving compared to the prior periods. The most notable accomplishment of the quarter, as you might imagine, was the completion of our repayment of the -- our TARP preferred stock obligation and redemption of that stock, which is encouraging to us. Good to have that chapter behind us.", "Looking at the fundamentals, at a high level, we saw further strengthening of loan growth during the quarter. Our core net interest income declined, but at a slower rate than in the prior quarter, and our noninterest expenses also declined. Credit quality improved pretty materially in almost all categories and geographies. And finally, our capital improved, with tangible common equity increasing more than $100 million over the past 3 months.", "Looking at loan growth, we experienced more than $360 million of growth in our C&I portfolio. It's about 14% annualized, up from $225 million last quarter. We also saw strong growth in our 1-4 family loan portfolio, about 16% annualized, and moderate growth at about 6% annualized in terms CRE. There's some offset in our owner-occupied and construction development portfolios. But overall, we certainly are pleased to see some of the major categories strengthening in a way that we're very pleased with.  Geographically, Utah and Idaho showed the strongest growth, with solid performances from Texas, Arizona and Colorado.", "It's difficult to be precise about where our loan growth goes from here. There's much uncertainty about the business landscape as we have today. But we believe we'll continue to see moderate loan growth over the next year. We have construction commitments that have been growing somewhat and the equity going in first, and so we do expect that we'll see some strengthening in some of those balances, for example.", "Looking at net interest income, the core net interest income declined about $5 million compared to the prior quarter, which is a slower rate of decline than the most recent few quarters. In the past 6 months, our core net interest income has experienced some particularly strong headwinds, and we note that the recent roughly 10-basis-point drop in 3-month LIBOR will produce some pressure on net interest income further in the fourth quarter. But our analysis of rate resets on both loans and securities points to moderating pressure over the next 12 to 18 months from that source.", "Our guidance since January has been for core net interest income to be stable to slightly lower over the course of the year ahead, and we continue to believe that we should be able to generate enough loan growth over the next 12 months to offset most of the pressure inherent in our earning asset base.", "One of the drivers of an improving net interest income will be an improvement in small business lending, which is a core element of our customer base. Nationally, small businesses have been slower than some larger businesses to emerge from recession. However, more small business customers have indicated an improvement in sentiment compared to just a few months ago, although the economic and political uncertainty, the fiscal cliff, et cetera, could certainly create an adverse change in that modest improvement.", "Credit quality is something we continue to be very pleased with. I'm particularly encouraged with the drop in OREO expenses to nearly 0. And while this may not be sustained, there is a positive trend in collateral values within many of our markets, which is leading to gains on sale of some of our foreclosed real estate relative to book values. You can also see the effects of this and the improvement in the effective yield on FDIC-supported loans and in the 20% linked-quarter decline in gross charge-offs.", "So those are some of the highlights. I'll turn the time over to Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. As noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common of $62.3 million or $0.34 per diluted common share for the quarter. As we exclude the noncash expense associated with sub debt amortization from our modified sub debt, revenue from FDIC loan discount accretion and the onetime preferred dividend associated with the accretion and the remaining discount on the TARP preferred stock and earnings available to common was $0.46 a share.", "To give you an idea of what the run rate would've been for the quarter, if we exclude the regular TARP dividend of about $9 million for the quarter, which will not be present in the fourth and future quarters, earnings available to common would have been $0.51 per share, which translates into a return on financial common equity of approximately 10%.", "Turning to revenue drivers. As Harris noted earlier, we were reasonably pleased with the amount of loan growth, which was relatively broad-based. Origination volumes for new loans as well as renewals increased about 5% from the prior quarter and increased about 17% from the year-ago period. And the pipelines for our various affiliate banks remain fairly healthy.", "Turning from volume to rate, if we hold product mix constant, the coupon yield on loan production declined at a relatively similar pace compared to the prior quarter. And our experience was fairly consistent with the national data regarding commercial loan pricing. Lenders are indicating that the competitive environment, that's our lenders, that is, are indicating that the competitive environment for larger and middle-sized loans is beginning to show signs of stability. However, small business price competition has increased somewhat in recent weeks, and there are a relatively small number of customers that are qualified to borrow, making the marketplace a bit of a borrower's market right now.", "Let me take a couple of minutes to run through some growth statistics on different bank subsidiaries in our franchise. Zions Bank, which covers Utah and Idaho, grew loans held for investment by nearly $120 million, driven predominantly by C&I. Growth was partially offset by declines in commercial real estate and the continued planned decline in owner-occupied and CRE loans held in our National Real Estate Group.", "Amegy Bank, which is predominantly a Houston-based bank, with some prevalence in Dallas and San Antonio, experienced growth of more than $80 million, up from approximately $30 million in the prior quarter. The growth came from commercial and consumer loans, and again, partially offset by continued declines in both categories of commercial real estate, that is construction and term.", "National Bank of Arizona experienced pretty strong growth across the board, some commercial businesses to commercial real estate to residential mortgage. Vectra Bank, our Colorado subsidiary, also experienced solid loan growth across all 3 major loan types.", "The 2 affiliates that experienced meaningful attrition in loan balances were California Bank & Trust, which saw an organic decline in commercial loans and loans supported by FDIC assistance. Declines were partially offset by organic growth in commercial real estate and a bit of consumer loan growth. And the other bank experiencing attrition was our Nevada State Bank subsidiary, and that market is, as many of you know, still very slow to emerge from the recession.", "Harris referenced some of the loan growth rates by product type on Page 10 of the release, so I'll be brief in my comments on that. But I'll hit some of the highlights. C&I growth has been coming from a diverse group of industries. Energy remains a strong component, and we're seeing strengthening in manufacturing and consumer goods and services after long declines in both of those categories. The industries that are still detracting from C&I growth rate are construction-related businesses and some professional services firms. Net syndication and participation loans declined about $200 million compared to the prior quarter to about $1.5 billion in total.", "As we've discussed in the past, the decline in owner-occupied loan portfolio is largely attributable to a decision made several quarters ago as a part of our concentration risk management efforts. That decision was to selectively reduce certain aspects of our exposure in our National Real Estate business.  Much of this is in the SBA 504 loan product. We expect additional attrition in this portfolio before it stabilizes, probably starting around the middle of next year, middle of 2013.", "Construction development loans were down just over $140 million, which was somewhat unexpected. We've highlighted in the past few months that we've booked several hundred million dollars of new loan commitments for construction and development lending, which we expect will begin to fund over the next several months. However, payoffs this quarter were stronger than anticipated, resulting in a net decline in the portfolio. We still expect those new commitments to fund, but may be offset by higher attrition in the fourth quarter.", "Within consumer lending, residential first mortgage loans grew at about 4% in the quarter, which is a rate that is comparable to the prior quarter. That growth was fairly widespread across the footprint.", "Turning now to the net interest margin on Page 14, you'll notice that the GAAP NIM was stable. But the core NIM, which adjusts for items such as the sub -- modified sub debt conversion cost and the accretion on acquired loans, that core NIM actually declined about 12 basis points, and we give you that reconciliation between the GAAP and the core on Page 15 of the release.", "Let me begin by addressing the yield in the securities portfolio, which declined to 3.4% -- from 3.8% last quarter. As we mentioned in the last quarter's call, the second quarter included some catch-up income. If normalized for that, the securities yield decline would have been about 25 basis points.", "While we do not have a large MBS portfolio that's subject to refinancing risk, we do have securities where the underlying collateral consists of SBA and municipal loans, both of which are subject to rates resetting. For example, dealing with [ph] 2007, that had a fixed rate for the first 5 years, is resetting this year, that is, in 2012, at lower rates. Same phenomenon that we've talked about in our -- some of the parts of our loan portfolio. We expect that the securities portfolio yields will be under some additional modest pressure over the next few quarters.", "Turning to loan yield. That declined 13 basis points to 4.94% from 5.07% last quarter again excluding FDIC-supported loans. This compression was attributable to the same factors that we've discussed in the past, which are adjustable rate loans resetting to lower rates, driven by a lower repricing index today compared to several years ago when the loans were booked and maturing loans that we'll replace with new loans at lower coupons and floors. Recall when these loans were last originated, most had rate floors at higher levels and/or wider spreads with relative -- relevant benchmark index in the current market repricing.", "A third factor is a continued mix shift towards lower-yielding residential mortgage loans held for investment, which warrants noting that while mortgages are incrementally dilutive to the NIM, the income from those mortgages is accretive to net interest income, basically converting 0 earning cash into mortgages.", "As we highlighted back in January, 2012 is not going to be a particularly good year for NIM, and we noted that it would take a significant amount of loan growth to offset that effect. But we also said that as we enter 2013, the pressure should begin to subside to a more moderate level. Assuming a static balance sheet, we estimate that the NIM will be subject to ongoing pressure due to rate resets and new originations at current market levels, which are significantly lower than 3 to 5 years ago. However, because a fair amount of that resetting, refinancing volume is behind us, the pressure on the net interest income over the next 1 to 2 years should be lower than we've experienced over the last several quarters.", "We're also mindful of a recent fairly sharp decline in LIBOR.  Roughly 10 basis points lower than the third quarter average is where it is today. If it stays there, that is likely to cause 2 to 4 basis points of NIM pressure in the fourth quarter.", "Potential offsets to the NIM compression include loan growth, moderate -- modest reduction in the cost of interest-bearing deposits, or in the case of the fourth quarter of 2012, the decline in the average cash balance, which served as the source of the TARP redemption, which, itself, should lift the NIM by about 4 basis points, all else being equal. Finally, I again note that our balance sheet remains quite asset-sensitive.", "Turning now to noninterest income. There are 2 items probably worth highlighting. First is that dividend in other investment income decreased compared to the prior quarter. Last quarter had some unusually large equity gains or gains in equity investments, primarily in Amegy, primarily attributable to the energy sector. Those gains were a bit more normal levels this quarter. It's also notable that gains from cash principal payments on our CDO portfolio exceeded the OTTI from that portfolio this quarter as principal paydowns and payoffs occurred on previously written-down securities. We expect such gains to continue, although they will likely be sporadic. I will note that in the fourth quarter, i.e., in the last couple of weeks, we have received cash principal paydowns from the BankAtlantic TruPS payoffs, which will result in a gain in the mid-single-digit millions on those securities.", "On a related note, we saw an improvement in the AOCI mark by just over $40 million after tax, which was supported by improvement in the risk spreads on riskier assets, further decline in the number of banks deferring interest payments and a continued increase in the number of banks coming current on their payments. A total of 58 banks in our CDOs, that were previously deferring at one point have now come current and have stayed current on payments.  While we generally expect the value of the CDOs to improve over the long term, we caution that the path to improvement is likely to be somewhat volatile.", "Turning now to credit. Let me summarize that virtually all the ratios that was in the release and others that we track, all improved significantly compared to the prior quarter. Not shown in the release, for example, are the NPA inflows, favorable resolutions versus unfavorable resolution rates and the loss severity rates, all of which compared meaningfully -- all of which improved meaningfully compared with the prior quarter.", "Also, as you're aware right now, the loan regulator's [ph] chief accountant recently provided some interpretive guidance for banks whose consumer borrowers had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The guidance states that banks should charge down effective loans to their collateral values and reclassify them as troubled debt restructured loans, even if, as is the case in the many -- in a number of cases, even if the borrower is current with principal and interest payments and have not requested any modifications to loan terms. The company did not implement that guidance this quarter. We'll be trying to assure that we're doing this consistently for all 3 regulators who have to oversee us, but we have made some preliminary estimates. We estimate that only about $31 million of our loans' principal balance will be affected by this guidance if implemented. And we think, because of this limited amount, we expect that any charge-offs taken would be in the single-digit millions and should not affect the provision for loan losses. By single-digit millions, I mean not more than $7 million and probably rather less than that is our current estimate. No adjustments were made to the -- in the third quarter results pending completion of our analysis.", "Finally, looking at capital GAAP tangible common equity ratio, improved to 7.2% from 6.9%, in part due to retained earnings but also the previously mentioned in accretion in the AOCI mark and a moderate decline in assets due to our TARP redemption. Estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio increased by 6 basis points from 9.84%.", "Okay, some guidance for the future. As we potentially stare an election and fiscal cliff and other uncertainties in the face, I do this with a bit of trepidation, but we'll do the best we can. For loan growth, we see continued strength in our loan pipelines, had an increase in commitments in the last 6 months, and our customer's feeling a bit more optimistic. We do expect continued moderate loan growth over the next year or so. That loan growth does not, at this point, appear to be strengthening. But it seems to be holding fairly steady. Despite very expected loan growth, we're probably going to see a moderate amount of pressure on core net interest income, in part due to the new headwind of lower LIBOR rates as well as continued rate resets and the refinancing of older loans.", "Noninterest income, we expect the less-volatile components of noninterest income, such as service fees, to continue a modest upward trend. While we don't have much income that comes from mortgage banking, we are experiencing a slightly elevated level of revenue from that source, which could subside when the current refi boom fades. However, it's such a small component of our income that it's not likely to move the needle on your models.", "It's there in [ph] our CDO portfolio and OTTI, in general, that should remain low.  As fewer banks are failing, more are recovering, and our model is already quite conservative at predicting bank failures. Offsetting this trend may be faster bank prepayments of trust preferred securities, which has the effect of converting cash to the senior tranches that we own, potentially improving AOCI and fixed income gains there. But it removes excess spread from the mezzanine tranches, potentially resulting in additional OTTI. Net or on balance we expect these 2 effects to be accretive to tangible common equity over time.", "For additional information on this phenomenon, you might want to again look at our recent investor relations slide decks for sensitivity analysis on this point.", "Noninterest expense in the near term should continue to be relatively stable. We expect that provision expense to remain low, continued reduction in problem credits, the ongoing improvement in loss severity rates has the potential to result in negative provision. However, continued loan growth may offset that and keep the provision somewhere around zero or very low.", "Regarding preferred stock dividends, as we've already guided, the preferred stock dividend in the fourth quarter should be approximately $23 million given effective [ph] full repayment of TARP in the third quarter.", "With that, let's open up the line for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question in the phone queue comes from Erika Penala with Bank of America.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question, Doyle, is on the trajectory of the core NIM going forward. Could you -- you mentioned that the spread compression this quarter was the same as last quarter, but could you remind us at where you're originating your current loans at today?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'll let James have a look. He's got some data, I'm going to -- on that. I'm going to let him look for it. It has been relatively stable, just a very slow downward drift over the last 6 or 7 quarters. So we're not seeing the average spread over mass maturity cost of funds compacting very much.", "James R. Abbott", "And Erika, it really does depend on the loan products and type for commercial business loans. We're looking at yields that are in the high 3% range. Small business loans are in the -- actually in high 4s, low 5s still. So it depends on the size and the product type and so forth. Commercial real estate is about -- oh, I'm sorry, residential and real estate is about 3.5% or so in that range. On -- throughout the overall mix for the company, we had about a 4% yield on a coupon basis, not including fee income, of new origin -- on absolute new originations, that's correct.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And just my follow-up question is on the other side of the balance sheet. Could you give us a sense, and even if you -- the long-term debt cost is still relatively high, and clearly, we've been threatened with this lower-rate environment for longer.  Is there something you can do over the next 12 to 24 months in terms of calling this or taking this down? Because it's -- I mean, based on our conversations with our fixed-income folks, you could issue 5-year senior in the low 4%, which is significantly lower than what your long-term debt is costing you right now.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We're keenly aware of that. And without making any promises, we've highlighted in a number of investor presentations that we have both capital and debt that was issued during the crisis, kind of in the period 2009 to 2010, that was very expensive. We did our best to, and I think successfully, either kept those maturities fairly short or built call options into them. We do have another large series of preferred stock Series C that becomes callable in September of next year. We have 8% trust preferred just on the $300 million of that that's callable at any time. And then we have both senior and subordinated debt maturing in 2014 and some in 2015 that's very expensive. It doesn't mature until then, but we could tender for it. It's not callable, but we get tender for it. The question there would be whether the premium that would have to be paid for a successful tender is worth the yield pickup. But I'd finally also note that the market, as you kind of indicated, seems to be pricing our debt and investment grade these days, even though one of the agencies still doesn't have us there, although they have indicated that they're going to review that rating here in the fairly near future. So I think things are still moving in the right direction for us to be able to address some of those things at lower cost. I just can't, particularly as we get ready to go in the CCAR exercise, give you much guidance on exactly when and in what order we'll begin to address those things. But we will. We do expect to address them.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "You mentioned in your guidance, Doyle, that you thought expenses would be flattish over the next few quarters. Is that sort of the result of ongoing credit-related expenses and those improving steadily, being sort of offset by just maybe more incentives as things get a little bit better? Can you kind of describe the dynamics that may be going on within the individual categories?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think you pretty well laid it out, almost. I mean, I -- basically, I do think that all the credit-related costs will continue to slowly decline. I mean, OREO is not likely to be 0 every quarter, unlike it was this quarter. But the general trend should continue to be down, but there probably will be some offset to that in salary kind of expenses. I think we've done a pretty good job of controlling salary and related expenses. But the general trend there should be very slowly upward, I would think. And the 2 -- I think the 2 roughly offsetting.", "Operator", "Next questioner in queue comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I just want to ask about the excess cash balance position. Now that we're past TARP, you made the payback. Can you walk us through -- you still have about, depending on the period end versus the average balance, $7 billion to $8 billion of cash on the balance sheet earning 27, 25 basis points or so. How are you guys thinking through starting to use that and to redeploy that into loans? And what's the trigger for finally starting to kind of move that route?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, loan demand would be a good trigger. I mean, it's still not great. It's better than it was, but it's not great. And I don't think that -- I think dramatically cutting rates in some attempt to stimulate loan demand is likely just to cut rates, not achieve any broader objective. So -- and we still remain pretty cautious on deploying any significant amount of that cash into securities instruments with the duration extension risk of any meaningful amount.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So, Doyle, even though average loan balances were up $400 million or so this quarter, but cash was flat, so I'm kind of talking about just the -- even within what you've got already, it seems like you're letting deposit growth just kind of still accrue onto the balance sheet, so you haven't gotten a -- is there some cash that's trapped that you can't move away? Or is it just that your continued caution will just prevent any type of remixing on the balance sheet?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "As we look at where the cash is coming from, it's mostly coming from noninterest-bearing commercial DDA accounts. And we've tried to manage down the amount of and cost of just about everything else.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Almost $600 million this quarter, and that's...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "So, darn, our customers keep wanting to leave more money with us.  And we're basically paying nothing for that money except the FDIC costs.  And the earnings at the Fed roughly offset that. So it is a dilemma. I mean, the -- I think we can't figure out a whole lot more to do to keep deposits from continuing to flow in, particularly when it's commercial customers being conservative, sitting on cash and not deploying it, and they are growing their businesses in this uncertain environment. And that makes -- despite what we said about some businesses turning more optimistic and beginning to grow and borrow, there are still others that are generating a lot of cash and that are, for the time being, sitting on it and putting it on our balance sheet, which we, in turn, put on the Fed's balance sheet.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. And then my -- I'll just make my follow-up on the same topic. Is there a proportion of the balance sheet that you still have to keep in the securities book, because to your point about not wanting to extend in the securities portfolio, couldn't you continue to let that part of the book run down? Or are you already at a level where you need it for liquidity and pledging, et cetera?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, we don't -- I mean, cash is more liquid than securities. So I -- the -- David, do you want to comment on that at all?", "Unknown Executive", "[indiscernible] I mean, we don't have to have a certain level of securities. I mean, you can see here from the balance sheet that the securities are running down each quarter, that's through maturities or through prepayments. And we've done very little purchasing, because the benefit -- I mean, you all know that a 2-year treasury yields less than 25 basis points, I mean -- which is what the Fed is paying us on our Fed [indiscernible]. There are hardly no interest rate risks. It's a problem we talk about and think about every day, but we're submitted to not getting ourselves caught when the interest rates double, but we're living in [indiscernible].", "Harris H. Simmons", "I think it's also fair to say -- I mean, roughly half of our securities today are also not really a source of liquidity. I mean, the CDOs are -- we absolutely think their money's good in terms of how we have them recurring [ph] values we have on our financial statements. But they're not a source of liquidity in the sense that you can go out and find a buyer immediately. So holding a little more cash in lieu of that is, I think, prudent.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Back on Page 4 of the release, you'll notice just over $2 billion of amortized cost of our securities is in that CDO portfolio. And as Harris said, that remains -- while it's improved a bit, it's -- basically, I would characterize it as still highly illiquid.", "Operator", "Next phone question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, I guess, on Erika's question on capital plan and thinking about going into CCAR 2013, is the focus likely to be just on redeeming this higher-cost TruPS and refinancing the Series C? Or is there any chance we might see a dividend increase as well?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "They -- the -- I mean, we're -- I guess we are mindful that our shareholders, common shareholders, have been long-suffering. And as the trajectory of earnings continues to improve, I think we do at some point want to deliver modest increases to the dividend. But we do have -- I think our equally high, or if not higher, priority is to increase earnings to common that would be dividend-able in the future by reducing these financing and capital costs. We have a lot of capital and -- capital markets and debt markets actions to do over the next 2 years or so, all with the objection -- objective of cleaning up the capital structure and reducing its costs and the debt structure.", "James R. Abbott", "I'd also just add -- I mean, I -- if we did anything, I think it's likely to be modest. And especially, well, depending on the outcome of, not just the presidential elections but the elections generally and what's likely to happen with the taxation of dividends beginning of the year, because you could see, effectively, a trebling of the tax on dividend, that income. And that would probably play into our board's thinking about it.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That certainly makes sense. So I guess the other question was can -- do you have any updated thoughts about potential deposit outflows related to the TAG guarantee going away at the end of the year? Anything about that?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "What we're not seeing or hearing is a great hue and cry among our commercial customers about that topic. So I guess our thinking is beginning to drift in the direction of, particularly depending on what a couple of rating agencies do, that the expiry of the TAG Program may not be a particularly big event.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Hard to think that it won't have some impact, but I -- but so far, we're not getting a lot of feedback through the grapevine that that's something that's much talked about.", "Operator", "Next phone question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Now you talked -- you gave some pretty good color about the different regions and what's doing better, what's not. And I think there's a lot of commentary about both Phoenix and Vegas doing much better in homebuilding. But you kind of listed them as the regions doing the weakest of the 5 that you're in. Can you just add a little more color on that?  Because there's been a lot of good commentary media reports about Vegas and Arizona.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I said Arizona was actually pretty strong across the board for us. But you are correct, for us, this quarter, Southern Nevada still remains pretty flat in terms of aggregate -- or the net change in their loan portfolio. I don't -- Harris, do you have any recent color on that?", "Harris H. Simmons", "No. I think across the board in Arizona, we're seeing improvement in growth. But the Las Vegas market is decidedly slower.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Is the Vegas market slower?  And then -- and the other issue, you said that, and you talked about how the energy loans and a lot of your loan demand that you're seeing is well diversified. Are you bidding a lot of housing-related loans? Are they starting to come through or is that -- they're still being muted?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "On the residential side, we are seeing some growth there.  Is that's what you mean, Paul?", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "No, I mean the homebuilders. I'm talking about the overall derivative effect of a recovering housing market in those areas. Are you starting to see -- when you guys were picking homebuilding in Vegas, I believe, on the derivatives, are you saying -- are you being -- I'm just wondering how much of this loan demand is related to some of the recoveries of those markets.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I would maybe chime in here. We did see a little bit of -- on the C&I side, businesses would have a construction bent to them.  We did see a slight increase in the third month of the quarter. So it's hard to say that 1 month is a trend. It's still down, it's still generally pulling our loan balances down off businesses that have construction-related activities.", "Operator", "Our next questioner comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a question on NIM here. It's -- I know you guys have been pretty clear in the past about -- I think it was roughly 4 basis points of loan compression from the floors that are resetting, and I know there's a couple other things in the quarter that would have driven it down sequentially. Where are you surprised, in terms of NIM discourse? Let me go out on a limb here and say that the NIM compression was a lot worse than what we were expecting, and I'm trying to figure out what was different such that we either may or may not build in another, say, 12 basis points of compression next quarter, if that makes sense?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I think we pointed out -- we've given you 2 sources that would be ongoing pressures that added up to kind of 8 to 10. And yes, it was a little bit more than that. I mean, the additional cash balances that were there for most of the quarter, that probably accounts for -- on NIM itself...", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "1 to 2.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Another 1 to 2, so you get close to the total. I don't think there's any other single thing that was a particular driver. And then in terms of net interest income, what we've been saying is that we needed net $400 million to $500 million loan growth on average to sort of offset the known pressures. And we kind of got around the bottom end of that and then almost kept core noninterest income stable. So I don't think we're too far off in our guidance. I mean, I -- when you get down to 1 or 2 basis points, it's kind of hard for us to get it that precise, I'm sorry.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. No, that's fine. Just another question I had, in terms of the CDO portfolio, given some of you expect additional gains, and then I guess I'm thinking like the BankAtlantic in fourth quarter, but also from higher prepayments, you'd have more OTTI. When you think about the net number here -- I mean, is it such that the additional cash principal payment gains might offset the OTTI on a net basis? Or is it just too volatile in Q2 [indiscernible]?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "All we said is the effect on income in any given quarter may be either positive or negative from that. They probably won't predictably offset each other in any one direction every quarter. But what we have said is that the net effect on tangible common equity of all this should be positive from those effects, because while you have those 2 somewhat countervailing effects on the income statement, the same phenomenon should be increasing the -- or improving the AOCI mark, as it did this quarter.", "Operator", "Next questioner in queue comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I know one of the reasons you haven't shown stronger loan growth over the past few quarters has been an unwillingness to match price competition, particularly in markets like California. Are you now being more competitive with price? Is this what's driving loan growth to improve a bit here?", "Harris H. Simmons", "We're trying not to let good customers go over a modest price difference and -- but also trying not to be the price leader on the way down as well. It's a fine balancing act. But yes, maybe we're, at the margin, more determined to keep good customers and not let them get away. But -- and so that probably has some impact on this. But again, as I say, the net effect of all of that on average spreads over mass maturity cost of funds month-to-month has not been very dramatic. It's been very, very incremental.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "There's a slide in our last investor presentation, I think, it shows that -- just to match maturity spreads on new production, it's fairly illustrative. And it's pretty flat.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, maybe just to follow up on that earlier comments, you indicated that customers appear more optimistic. It's very different from what we're hearing from some other banks that are less bullish on the loan growth outlook, citing commercial customers pulling back here a bit, given the fiscal cliff. Are you seeing a change in customer behavior across the different banks related to this?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I think the comments were a bit more specific to small business customers. And yes, I mean, when we started putting the script together, I really challenged James on that comment in particular. And -- but he's getting it from a fairly widespread sample of our loan officers with regard to small business. I don't think it applies necessarily to the upper middle market and commercial. So I -- maybe that helps.", "James R. Abbott", "Yes, I would just add that the small business lenders as we talked to them around the company have -- when you ask them the question, are things better today than they were 3 months ago, which is different from the question, are things better today than they were 4 years ago, but, no, their comments are fairly consistently unanimous that things seem to be better for the small business customer. They're probably a little bit more bankable today from a balance sheet and earnings perspective, and they are becoming a little bit more optimistic, at least the ones that we're dealing with.", "Operator", "Next questioner in queue comes from John Pancari with Evercore.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the magnitude of the margin compression you expect? I know you indicated you expect some continued pressure, but I'm more specifically wanting to see how you can kind of talk about the benefit of the excess liquidity you have. And as loan growth improves, I have to assume that, that provides Zions with a bit more resiliency to the margin than a lot of the other banks that may not have that benefit of the liquidity sitting on the balance sheet.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We would agree wholeheartedly with that statement. We -- that's part of the being asset-sensitive that -- what we -- if and when the Fed does start to raise rates, I mean, we would expect a couple of things. We would expect deposit rates to [indiscernible] loan repricing in that environment, and we would expect some outflow of that excess liquidity as companies begin to -- the Fed would only be doing that in an environment where economic activity is picking up. And so we would expect a lot of those commercial DDA deposits to begin to flow back out.  But we think there's so much of it that we could fund a lot of loan growth without substantial increases in deposit rates, at least, in the early staging of [indiscernible]. By the same token, the fact that we haven't put our mortgage-backed securities or other securities with duration extension risk means that as rates rise, we're not going to have a large pile of what would then become underwater securities that we would be selling at a loss if we needed to generate liquidity. So that's basically the game plan. If the Fed succeeds at keeping rates very low for longer, then it's going to take a while for that to play out. If we see a quicker return over the next year or 2 to economic -- more substantial economic growth, let's say, we -- I think we're very well positioned for that environment.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Well, I guess, also what I was getting at is, barring any move in short-term rates to the upside, just the -- I guess, I wanted to see how you thought about the asset mix shift, just funding loan growth the excess liquidity [indiscernible] earning asset mix shift could provide some stability there.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, yes. I mean, we have -- we're earning 25 basis points on that cash. And on -- every loan we put on earns us 400 basis points, plus or minus. So the pickup is 3 75 for every dollar of cash that converts to a loan. That's the basic math. Maybe you're asking that more subtle question than I'm getting. I'll give you one more try.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "No, no, that's essentially it.  I guess I was just looking for if you could put that into context of the margin compression that you expect through 2013.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, yeah, I mean that's -- what we've said is that if can get $400 million to $500 million of average loan growth at kind of current rates consistently, that offsets the margin compression and keeps net interest income stable.", "James R. Abbott", "And I would add -- maybe I would add, too, that it's a little bit harder to predict sometimes on margin because, for example, back in January when we first gave guidance about the margin compression in the 4, 5 \"basis point per quarter\" range, we didn't incorporate in that view a decline in -- a sharp decline in LIBOR rates. So there are a lot of factors at work, sharp decline in residential mortgage pricing as well. So those are some of the considerations that could cause additional pressure. But back at that point in time, we estimated that as you went into 2013, it was 2, maybe, or so basis points per quarter of margin compression throughout 2013. And recent analysis is not suggesting something significantly different than that. And that's, again, on a static balance sheet.  It assumes no growth. So...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "By the way, this LIBOR decline down to about 30 basis points or so, that's about as -- that's getting close to its low as it's been in over the last 5 years, going back even pre-crisis. So -- and it's short-term LIBOR, so that repricing effect is not one that continues for a long, long time per se. It's probably worked its way through fairly quickly.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Right, okay. And then there's a different topic. As for now, I'll ask about the loan loss reserve at 253 bps of loans here. I just want to get your thoughts on, long term, where that could normalize out at.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I'll -- I'm going to continue to refer to the regulators, the FASB and the SEC, on that question. I'm aware they're having lots and lots of discussions, and the regulators apparently expressing the point of view that companies should have -- maybe have not been cautious enough about releasing reserves aggressively and that, that can't continue.  And -- we don't think they were particularly talking about us when they made those comments. And so we're -- I think we'll continue to just be cautious and follow the trends.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue comes from Steve Scinicariello with UBS.", "Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just given the slightly more optimistic tone on loan growth, I'm just trying to separate how much is really demand-driven from better environmental kind of drivers versus how much is driven by you guys feeling much more comfortable now that TARP is behind you, and you can deploy a lot of this excess liquidity. So just kind of curious maybe how much of this more optimistic tone is demand-driven rather than maybe supply-driven.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "None of it's really supply-driven. It's demand-driven. TARP -- having TARP -- having repaid TARP had, I don't think, any impact either way on our willingness to lend. We've for quite some time now been turning over rocks, looking for credit-worthy borrowers who wanted to grow and borrow, and that has not changed. What's changed is a little bit more willingness on the part of the few more borrowers to do so.", "Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Good. No, that's good to hear. And then I was just curious, in that vein, I think you said -- mentioned that total loan commitments were up like $400 million last quarter. Just kind of curious what that might be in the third quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'm going turn to James, because I don't know.", "James R. Abbott", "My [ph] commitments were up a couple hundred million dollars this quarter.  Over the last, I think -- year-to-date, I think it's up $1.5 billion. So it's up fairly substantially. Some of the biggest commitment increases came in the prior quarter and the quarter before that. They were in part related to construction loans which, again, we mentioned that we think that will cause some loan growth in that category in the future.", "Operator", "Our next questioner in queue comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just real quick, I think the -- what's interesting is you guys have a bunch of levers, right? So the excess liquidity is out there that, really it's demand that from customers that can help deploy that. On the capital side and debt side, it's kind of more at your control. I guess what I'm wondering is when you think about your senior debt and the sub debt, the trust preferreds, do you have to wait to CCAR in order to think about tendering for those?  Or is that something you think you could do before the CCAR process takes place?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It's a question -- that's a question we're asking ourselves, Brian, and I don't know the answer. It's a [indiscernible]. I mean, it's a good question. I think it's unequivocally true that actions that on net would reduce capital, particularly core Tier 1 kinds of capital, so it would reduce parent liquidity significantly with the -- probably not entertain-able except in the context of the CCAR process upcoming. Whether you could do some things that were -- like we did with earlier this year, with exchanging one piece of preferred for another piece of preferred that were substantially similar, except for a lower cost. Whether you could do some of that is an open question and one that is of interest.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And then maybe just a follow-up on that, can you update us on liquidity that's at the parent company now and then what kind of dividend capacity you can upstream from the subs?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think the parent has very ample liquidity. I know it's well -- it's in excess of $0.5 billion with the parent kind of where it's been and where we're targeting it. And all the banks are profitable, and most are upstreaming dividends and some -- there's probably still some but smaller than our recent quarter's repatriation of capital from some of the subs still yet to come. So I don't think cash at the parent, per se, is constrained on the common dividend. It's one of the other things we talked about earlier in response to a question.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "So it sounds like you've got the ability to access that cash. It's just the matter of working it -- working through the whole CCAR, the regulators.", "James R. Abbott", "Right. Cash at the parent is almost $600 million. Actually, it's about $580 million at the end of the third quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "And as we -- the net parent cash needs now both for TARP repayment and for TARP dividends are -- they've declined substantially and, as we address some of these other higher-cost things, will continue to decline. So we're feeling pretty good about the parent cash.", "Operator", "And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our times for question. I'd like to turn the program back over to Mr. Abbott for any additional or closing remarks.", "James R. Abbott", "So again, thank you very much for joining us this afternoon. I'll be happy to take follow-up questions if you have them, and we'll see you at another investor conference or on the next analyst call next quarter.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.", "It's now my pleasure to turn the time over to James Abbott. Please go ahead, sir.", "James R. Abbott", "Thank you, Ian. Good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2012 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. Harris?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you to the call today. Before I start into this, I'm going to go off the script for just a moment and briefly recognize James Abbott here. He's been recognized by all of you, both buy and sell side, as the best IR exec in the mid-cap bank space by Institutional Investor Magazine, and we're really proud of James and the role he plays here. So we may have -- or had a lot of moving parts in our net interest margin and other things, but apparently, at least, we give James credit for explaining it well, and I just want to congratulate James in front of his constituents here.", "Expectedly, the quarter -- several underlying trends of the fourth quarter were generally quite strong, with better-than-expected performance from credit quality, from certain of our capital levels, loan growth, net interest income. We're encouraged with our ability to cut some costs as we move through 2012, primarily from the cost of debt and preferred equity. We're hopeful that we'll be able to continue to improve our return on equity in 2013 as we intend to further reduce the cost of our capital and financing structure.", "Let me touch upon a couple of fundamental highlights for the quarter. Credit quality. First, an 8% national unemployment rate and 2% GDP growth isn't what any of us would call a robust environment, but our credit quality metrics are rapidly returning to levels last seen when the economy was in much stronger shape than it is today. We attribute a portion of the improvement to improved risk management and credit risk reduction efforts for the past few years and, some of it also, the customers' continued ability to repair their personal and business balance sheets despite the tepid economic environment that we're in.", "Our net charge-off ratio was only 0.2%, about 20 basis points, a level comparable to the full year of 2007. Our nonperforming asset ratio, expressed as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned dropped just below 2%, and we expect to see further general improvement in that ratio as we continue through the year 2013.", "Loan growth. We generally see more variability probably at loan growth in the fourth quarter than other quarters, and this wasn't any exception. As many of you know, we raised the cautionary flag in late November at an investor conference and as loan balances had declined more than $150 million from the end of the third quarter. We subsequently experienced particularly robust growth in December, some of which was related to tax strategies on the part of customers. That would have been obviously unique to the fourth quarter of 2012. Some of it was short-term draws by some of our customers who subsequently paid off a portion of these borrowings in the early part of the first quarter.", "Excluding the variability that goes with the fourth quarter, our lenders report to us that they remain positive about growth prospects in the loan portfolio. The pipelines are generally still pretty strong. Customers seem to be generally more optimistic than they were 6 months ago, and production volume rose in each quarter of 2012. Although pricing remains competitive, we have not experienced much additional pressure on the loan production in the last 6 months.", "Net interest income declined about $8 million or 2% compared to the prior quarter. In November, we said that we anticipated perhaps a 2% to 3% decline in core net interest income. And while we haven't calculated that for you in this release, I'll note the decline was less than anticipated. We currently believe that net interest income should be relatively stable in 2013.", "And then a final comment, just about convexity risk. We're seeing increasing signs of economic activity around the country. And while it's unclear of when interest rates will rise, we're one of the very limited number of banks that are significantly asset-sensitive, as many of you know. Not only do we expect earnings to increase when rates rise, we expect to be able to avoid a significant haircut to equity that many banks may experience due to the heavy concentrations of mortgage-backed securities and other fixed-rate obligations with convexity or optionality in them that we could see in a rising-rate environment.", "With that overview, I'll ask our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Doyle Arnold, to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thanks, Harris, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me add my congratulations to James. And let me also note, I'm suffering from a bit of a cold, so if I happen to go into a coughing spell, I may lateral to James at any time to get through my notes and maybe lateral back at some point. So I apologize in advance if I have to do that.", "As noted in the release, we did post net income applicable to common shareholders of $35.6 million or $0.19 per diluted common share for the quarter. As noted in the release and as we had previously disclosed back in maybe the early part of December, we recognized -- we did recognize a significant impairment charge against the CDO portfolio this quarter, as well as gains on securities that also came from CDOs, which netted to an after-tax cost of about $0.25 per share. Let me also point -- and we'll talk a lot more about that in a few minutes.", "Let me also point out some -- a couple of accounting and disclosure changes that we made this quarter. Although the first with regard to some reclassifications, as described in the press release in some detail, I'll note that we reclassified a couple of items which had the net effect of reducing net interest income and increasing noninterest income. We presented all prior quarters on an as-adjusted basis for comparability. For example, the net interest income is reported at $430 million in the fourth quarter compared to a revised $438 million in the third quarter, whereas we had previously, last quarter, said $444 million. So the net impact of the reclass was $6 million in the third quarter.", "The other line item that changed was other service charges, commissions and fees, which increased as a result of the changes. The bottom line, net earnings, pretax or net earnings to common were not impacted at all. We believe these changes bring us into greater consistency with what is common disclosure practices around the industry today.", "Also, as Harris didn't highlight but sort of alluded to earlier, this quarter we haven't calculated core net interest income and core net interest margin for you as the primary reasons for calculating that information was just try to strip out some of the noise related to the rather volatile subordinated debt conversions and also some of the income related to loans acquired with FDIC assistance. Conversion activity has slowed to, recently in this quarter, a minimal level. And the FDIC-assisted loan balances have declined to roughly $0.5 billion from more than $2 billion if you go back to late 2009 when they were acquired. So we think the adjustment is becoming less meaningful and informative, so we haven't really highlighted that this quarter. But we have given you, I think, what you need, and those who want to can make that calculation.", "Okay, turning to revenue drivers. Average loans increased $100 million compared to the prior quarter. We, of course, pay more attention to average loans because of the variability of -- in the period balances and because of a number that actually drives interest income and earnings for the quarter. In the period, loans increased $463 million, excluding changes in FDIC-supported loans. But approximately $100 million of that has run off thus far in January.", "I would note, and we'll talk about it again, that we saw a similar phenomenon that was even more pronounced a year ago of runup and then rundown. The runup wasn't quite as strong this quarter and the rundown at this point hasn't been as strong either.", "Let me draw your attention to the loan table on Page 10 of the release. Commercial and industrial loans had some sub-seasonal trends, while they grew nearly 4% from the prior quarter and some of that backed off in January. I'll point out that C&I loans increased 8% compared to the year-ago period. And so the general trend remains positive.", "As we've discussed in the past, the decline in owner-occupied loans is largely attributable to a decision made over a year ago as a part of our concentration risk management efforts to selectively reduce certain aspects of our exposure in international real estate business, the bulk of which is the SBA 504 loan product. We expect additional attrition in this portfolio throughout this year before the balance is again destabilized late this year or early next.", "Construction and development loans were down $17 million or approximately 1% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, the balance is down 14%. We do expect this category to increase in 2013 due to the fairly strong growth in new commitments made in the second half of 2012. And in fact, balances are up moderately in January.", "Current CRE declined at 5 of the banks during the quarter, leading to a decline in the overall balance of about $77 million. This was primarily driven by elevated prepayments, new production volume actually exceeded the trailing 4-quarter average. We do expect this category to grow over time. But in the very near term, it may decline slightly. One of the headwinds to growing this portfolio is the reemergence of a CMBS market where originations were nearly twice as strong in 2012 compared to 2011.", "Finally, within consumer lending, the residential first mortgage loans grew at about 4% linked quarter, which is a rate that is comparable to the prior quarter, and the growth was fairly widespread across footprint. That's kind of a sort of a horizon on -- or the landscape on balances.", "Turning briefly to commitments. The unused commitments continue to grow at a solid pace even though the average loan growth of balances was not particularly strong. Commitments are growing at -- increasing at an 11% compounded annual growth rate during the last 2 years. A meaningful amount of that increase comes from loans, for example, commercial construction loans that are scheduled to \"fund up\" over the course of the next several months and quarters and thus we believe this should translate into loan balances increasing moderately over the year.", "Okay, turning to the net interest margin on Page 14 of the release. You'll note that the NIM declined 11 basis points compared to the third quarter. The components of that decline are roughly as follows: about 4 basis points were simply due to the increase in average cash balances, which you will note were up sharply despite having wired $700 million of cash back to the treasury right at the end of September; another 2 basis points was due to the decline in yield on FDIC-supported loans; and then the decline in other loan yields adversely impacted NIM by about 5 basis points.", "As we highlighted a year ago, last January, we didn't think 2012 was going to be a really great year for NIM, and it wasn't. We noted that it would take a significant amount of loan growth, about $400 million to $500 million per quarter, to offset the NIM effect on net interest income more than -- which was much more than roughly $100 million per quarter of average loan growth that did occur. But we also said that as we enter into 2013, the pressure should subside to a more moderate level. And we do still believe that's the case. Assuming a static balance sheet, we estimate the NIM should drift down slightly. However, because a fair amount of resetting and refinancing volume is behind us and because pricing on new loans seems to have somewhat stabilized, the pressure on net interest income over the next 12 months should be much lower than it was in 2012.", "Coming briefly to noninterest income, just a basic comment there. There are 2 things worth highlighting, both are related to the CDO portfolio. The first is to the impairment due to higher default probabilities on certain loans and the second is impairment due to higher prepayment assumptions that are most likely to happen in future quarters. First, let me comment on the higher default probabilities. And that was the biggest component of the most notable and noisy item in the quarter, which was the impairment charge of $84 million on CDOs. This was discussed at some length in the earnings release, as well as in the pre-releases and discussions by us at the FBR and Goldman Sachs conferences in late November, early December. But let me quickly recap here.", "I'll note that this discussion is not going to be an all-inclusive discussion of every nuance of the CDOs. We've tried to lay out that in great detail in our 10-Qs, and we'll be updating it in the 10-K which will be filed in a month or so. Now it's well-known to you -- most of you that we do own a portfolio of bank trust-preferred CDOs. They're about 800 underlying bank holding companies that are the sources of collateral and cash flow to the trust. If a bank holding company decides to defer interest payments either because its management elects to do so or because its regulators mandated or arm twisted, however they get there, the bank holding company generally, under terms of the offerings, have 5 years in which they can defer payments without triggering an event of default. If they stopped -- if they continue to defer after 5 years, then it is an event of default. But if they come current before that, it's not.", "Each bank holding company has one or more subsidiary banks. And historically, as the strength of the subsidiary bank goes, so goes the performance of the cash flows to the trust or the CDO. For example, a well-capitalized profitable bank is generally able to make its payments to its parent bank holding company which, in turn, is unlikely to default. Many of the deferring banks to which we have exposure, about 2/3 of them, are well-capitalized and profitable. However, we recently noted that some small bank holding companies are beginning to use what is known as a 363 Bankruptcy which could render invalid the assumption that a well capital bank has a low probability of default. Said differently, the subsidiary of the deferring bank holding company might be in decent shape but because the cash may be trapped to subsidiary due to regulatory constraints, the holding company simply may be unable to bring the trust-preferred obligation current at the end of the 5-year deferral period. It's also possible that even if there is cash at the parent company, it may be blocked from flowing out from the bank holding company to the trust by, for example, regulatory orders or things of that nature.", "In either case, we, in conjunction with our regulators and consultation with them, recognized therefore that some of the default probabilities on our banks really may be different from the default probabilities of the parent bank holding companies that issued the trust-preferred and, therefore, that our expected loss in some of these cases might need to increase as a result of this new development.", "However, because the trust-preferred securities are typically the only security issued by the smaller bank holding companies, we generally rank at or near the highest in the liquidation preference, which means we're still entitled to share in the proceeds of a bankruptcy sale. But if there's a bankruptcy process, then the outcome is less certain.", "Again, 2/3 of deferring bank holding companies are supported by bank subsidiaries that today are well-capitalized and profitable, which may be called -- result in some recovery value even if they do go through this process or get to the end of the 5-year period. However, the sale price of the primary asset, stock of the subsidiary bank, may or may not be sufficient to pay off all of the bank's trust-preferreds.", "There's just many a slip between the cup and the lip, as they say, in how these things may get resolved. We intend to be extremely active and have been in pursuing our interest in these cases. And although the number of cases we have pursued is small, we and the other significant holders of these notes or trust-preferred securities have generally been successful at recovering much or all of what our model estimates to be the value of the asset. However, because there's no historical data for re-performance rates and the outcomes of these kind of restructuring and bankruptcy proceedings, other than what we're seeing from our own CDOs, it's also possible we could have to recognize additional OTTI's as new evidence becomes available.", "Generally, I'd say as a result of all of this, we went back and looked at the banks in our deferring pool, remodeled them and, as a general matter, increased the probabilities of default and therefore the expected loss on, not all, but a number of them, which led to the majority of the OTTI that we took this quarter.", "The remainder largely came from impairment due to higher prepayment assumptions because we've been talking about things that might not pay off timely. Also during the fourth quarter, we saw people paying off more than timely. We saw a significant increase in prepayments by healthier institutions. And therefore the company made a decision to increase the assumed prepayment speeds on performing small banks and here small -- or bank holding companies, and here small is defined as those with less than $15 billion of assets.", "Historically, we've observed this CPR speed to be around 3%, which is what we've been modeling. However, the mission we've observed has significant increase in prepayments in the fourth quarter and there are strong arguments to expect continued higher rate for several years as new bank regulations regarding the capital treatment of trust preferred securities are phased in. Therefore, we increased the CPR assumption in our models from 3% to 10% for the next several years. Because cash flows are generally diverted to senior tranches first, this modeling change has the effect of more quickly paying off the senior tranches in full but results in reduced cash flows from the junior tranches as prepayment reduces excess -- let's call it excess spread, really just future cash available to those junior tranches. This could result in weaker credit values of the junior tranches, and did so this year.", "Then finally, we also recognized gains from full payoff of previously impaired securities this quarter. We recognize gains when either we get a full payoff on previously impaired securities or we get a paydown on any of the securities that we had previously purchased at fair value out of our former QSPE Lockhart Funding. And the gains this quarter were due to the latter. These were securities that we bought out of the QSPE at a discount to par or amortized cost because that was their fair value, and we subsequently received full value for them. They paid off in cash.", "And then finally related to the CDOs, we saw an improvement in the AOCI mark accumulated other comprehensive in part -- income of nearly $90 million after-tax. Some of that was a result of the AOCI mark going to the income statement because of the stuff we just discussed. And in others, it was just a result of -- resulted from improvement in risk spreads for riskier assets that we observed in the market. For the year, AOCI improved approximately $145 million due to, again, CDO valuation improvement.", "Turning to credit. The very short version is that we continue to see strong improvement in nonperforming assets and net charge-offs and other credit metrics. As a result, our allowance for credit losses model indicated a more moderate -- a moderate negative provision. We did highlight in the release that the primary reason for the sharp decline in net charge-offs was a very strong quarter for recoveries. Recoveries are expected to continue, but this quarterly weight may have been a particularly high one, and in any event, this is kind of lumpy.", "Capital, and let's see, that's the last item before we turn to guidance. The tangible GAAP common equity ratio declined to 7.1% from 7.2% in the prior quarter. And this was due essentially entirely to the significant buildup in deposit balances which were invested in deposits at the Fed, Fed Funds Repos.", "The estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio on a Basel I basis declined by about 8 basis points. Deposit balances have declined significantly since year end, which has resulted in a reduction of total tangible assets. These declines do not appear to be related to the expiration of TAG, and we kind of welcome them in a sense and the reduction should remove pressure on the GAAP capital ratios in the first quarter. And that's, I believe, that's for capital.", "Okay, a little bit of guidance and for the next few quarters, kind of how does 2013 look, and then we will turn to your questions. First, loan growth. With continued strength in the loan pipelines and the increase in commitment in the last 6 months and our customers seemingly feeling a bit more optimistic, we expect continued moderate loan growth over the coming 1 year or coming year.", "Net interest income. We do expect the net interest income to be relatively stable, at least in the next few months and quarters.", "The margin can be volatile due to the cash balances which, as noted previously, declined so far in Q1 after increasing dramatically in Q4. But on a static balance sheet and a stable rate environment, we would expect some additional compression in the NIM, but offsetting that would be the loan growth that appears is likely.", "Noninterest income. We expect the less volatile components of noninterest income such as service fees to continue a modest upward trend. We don't have much income from Mortgage Banking but even as the current refi booms, besides we expect some degree of offset to the slowing refis due to the fact that we're small in the market and we have been increasing our efforts to expand our mortgage lending business.", "Noninterest expense. The primary challenges to noninterest expense from the first quarter will be the increase in salary and benefits and the usual tax, social security-related stuff. Also in the fourth quarter, we reversed about $3 million of previously accrued incentive compensation, as certain long-term plans were no longer expected to payout at the previously accrued rate because of the performance in 2012. So 2012's expense was depressed because of that and we won't have that in the first quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter of 2012, that is, was held down because of that.", "So provision expense. We expect the provision expense to remain low. Continued reduction in problem credits and the ongoing improvement in loss severity rates continue to have the potential to result in a negative provision in the third quarter as it was in the fourth quarter. Although if loan growth strengthens enough, that could offset the ability to have negative provisions.", "Preferred stock dividends. We also, for those of you who haven't seen it, released after market today a press release announcing our intent to issue a new Series G preferred stock, and we expect to be issuing some additional preferred stock during the first half of 2013. We've previously discussed with you the fact that our Series C preferred stock, 9.5%, is callable in the third quarter of 2013 and we're -- and that we would be unlikely to call it without issuing probably not 100% of it in replacement preferred but a significant portion. So we'll be issuing some of that preferred which will temporarily drive dividend expense up. But in the long term, it should reduce the -- further reduce preferred stock dividend costs significantly.", "I believe that's enough of a monologue for me. And we'll -- operator or moderator, if you could queue up the questions, we will endeavor to respond to them.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you give us some greater details on the outlook for the relatively stable NII? Is that relative to 4Q's level or relative to the entire 2012? And does the outlook include any of the capital actions that you laid out that will reduce interest expense?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think the comment was relative to kind of 4Q as a starting point, not the whole year. But kind of the basic thing I tried to convey was whereas a year ago we thought net interest income would be trending down pretty steadily throughout 2012. We think that 2013 will first see a slowing then a flattening and then an improvement as we go through '13. That's what I tried to convey. Now, in general, there may be some noise in the net interest income and noninterest expense as a result of some of the things that we may do during the course of the year. So those were -- kind of my comments were back to the concept of a core. And I'll -- maybe without going into get too great a detail and tipping our hand, I mean, to the extent that we issue new debt in replacement of debt to be maturing or what have you, that will temporarily drive interest expense up. To the extent, however, that we tender for debt ahead of its maturity, that temporarily drives interest or other expense up but then drops it significantly. So what we will do, I want to get away from us computing a core, what we will try to do each quarter in which some of these things occur, if they occur, is give you a quantification of the components so you can make the adjustment that you deem to be appropriate. James, do you have any other comment on that? Okay, go ahead.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just as a follow-up. I know you talked about the rate of decline and the NIM slowing. And last year, you had talked about $400 million to $500 million of average loan growth needed to offset. How has that changed as we look into 2013? So what type of loan growth do we need to see in order to keep NII flat?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Significantly less. I don't know that we have an exact number that we've calculated yet. But do we, James? Do you have a good idea? But I'll tell you...", "James R. Abbott", "Probably around 2% to 3%. 2% to 3% loan growth would take care of the margin compression.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "And the reason is that we have gotten through the largest single period of 5-year resets that -- of loans that were made back in 2007 when rates and spreads -- the rates were much higher. They've all reset. All of those have reset. By the first half of 2008, originations of those kinds of loans had already begun to trend off. And by the second half, they've really collapsed as the economy -- well, you don't remember what happened in 2008. So the number -- the amount of loans that are resetting from higher rates that were prevalent 5 years ago to the very low rate environment today will be smaller in the first half, still significant but smaller in the first half of '13 than it was throughout last year. And by the second half of the year, it will -- that phenomena will be 80% behind us. The other thing is that loan pricing, as I mentioned, has stabilized whereas it's going back to the beginning of last year, the pricing of new loans was still trending down a bit. It does seem to have stabilized through most of the year. So there are particularly -- there are very specific reasons that we can point to, to say. And I guess to further it, I think the volume of out of the money options that matured in '12 was also higher than in '13 and '14. There's still some, but all of those headwinds are smaller this year and going forward than they were last year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "On your NII, stable NII, what type of interest rate scenario do you have or interest rates don't really matter now because of all the resets running through?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I was --  my comments were not predicated on much of a change in the interest rate environment. We remain -- I didn't comment on this, but we remain very highly asset-sensitive so that if the Fed does tighten or, if for any reason, rates were to rise earlier than the Fed has indicated, we believe that would change my guidance or outlook on net interest income. We would benefit significantly from rising interest rates.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So the stable NII...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'd say the stable -- you're talking NII, you mean net interest income, yes?", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, I tell you -- that's a comment if rate stay kind of as they are, low throughout the year.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And then also with buying back your, I think, Series C preferreds, I believe towards the end of the year, so really you're not going to get any benefit from buying that back into 2014, am I correct?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No. It's actually, it's a call. It's not a buyback technically. It is callable at par September 15 of -- so the benefit will be there throughout the entire fourth quarter, whatever it is.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And is that the only series that's callable? I was thinking of the slide presentation at Goldman Sachs, can you talk about 2 different series?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Our trust-preferred Series B, which has $293 million of outstanding, is callable at par at any time. And that's 8% cost.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So when you issue this new preferred, can you sort of call it back immediately or you just haven't set a time frame for that yet?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'm not going to give you enough detail, sorry, to specifically build a quarter-by-quarter model because I'm not going to get into the specific details of what was in my stress test and capital plan submitted to the Fed until I know they've completed their review and hopefully found that acceptable. But we'll announce what we need to announce, at this level of detail then.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Regarding the $200 million of series G announced today, I just wanted to follow up on that. It's a bit smaller than I was looking for as it relates to the Series C. Doyle, what are you targeting for preferreds to represent as a percent of risk-weighted assets and just curious what your thoughts were to do this now versus closer to the timing when you could call the Series C?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'm sorry, I just blinked. What was the first part of your question?", "James R. Abbott", "Percentage of preferreds.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Oh, yes. Yes, we've -- if you go back and look at our investor presentations throughout much of last year, I think starting with our hosted Investor Day in February we've, at various points in time, indicated that roughly 2% of risk-weighted assets would be our target level for preferred. It's somewhere -- or other Tier 1, which would include today some trust-preferred. Including a trust-preferred that were today, I believe, at around 3.3%, something like that percent, so -- and the Series C makes up the bulk of it. Trust-preferred is the second smallest piece and then series A and series E are the remainder of it. So we've also -- you didn't ask us specifically, but we've also indicated in various investor forum that we were unlikely to call the 800 -- approximately 800 million of Series E without issuing something on the order of 500 million to 600 million of perpetual preferred and partial replacement of it to get to those ratios. And we've also noted that the trust-preferred long-term isn't of any use as Tier 1 capital. So that kind of gives you, I think, the context of where we're trying to get to and what the major levers are to pull to get there. In terms of timing, I guess all I'd like to point out is that we've kind of consistently laid out a number of things that we want to do or need to address over the course of the next -- this year and the next to get the capital and financing structure in line with what they've indicated as our kind of medium-term target and to get the cost down. And we can't do it all at one time, so we're trying to basically trying to spread it out in a reasonable way.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's good color, Doyle. And just separately, I know the yield opportunity in the securities book isn't great, but it's better than the 28 bps that you're getting in the money market investments. Are there any thoughts there moving some of that liquidity into the securities book as you try and stabilize net interest income?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes. Something we look at continuously. Again, we don't know how to spell NBS very well here. So I think we could -- the challenge is to get a 2% plus yield, you're going to take some kind of risk. The risk of negative convexity is one that we're very wary of, doing very much of that. I think our actions back our words there. But there are things between 25 bps and 200 basis points that we look at from time to time and they do a little of. We also have a much better read, I think as this quarter goes on, of just what the long-term-or at least medium-term deposit balances of our customers are. As I mentioned, a significant chunk of that, $2.5 billion increase in deposits that occurred in the fourth quarter, has reversed already in the first quarter. So we'll have a little bit better idea of what we're looking at here as we get through the end of this quarter. But we're not going to go take on a lot of negative convexity risk. Yes, we may deploy some of it into probably lower yielding securities, but that are very safe and don't have the risk of extending maturities or duration when you don't want them to. I think that on previous call, David articulated very clearly what we're looking for. I laid down our criteria and invited any of you to call who had such an opportunity, and we're still waiting for the first phone call.", "James R. Abbott", "Like a March of Dimes telephoned around here. But maybe I'll just jump in those. The amount that we might do in some of these securities that Doyle was referring to would be very small. I don't think it would really affect your net interest income outlook much.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "In any one pool, we might be talking about some hundreds of millions and then totally we might be talking about $1 billion to $2 billion if we can find that. But we want to keep a lot of our powder for loan growth, which we do believe will happen someday, maybe even starting this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a question in terms of the CPR assumptions on the CDOs. I think I heard that you said that they're now at 10%, which obviously is a pretty big jump from where they were. Can you give us some context? How aggressive is that assumption? Because I guess sort of, we thought 3% to 5% might be aggressive. Now it's 10%. Obviously, this has been a big headwind for the OTTI or the losses on that portfolio historically, but I'm just trying to get a sense of the likelihood of further charges going forward?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'll offer a bit of commentary, and then invite David Hemmingway to chime in. We look at the actual and kind of historical trend every quarter. And throughout most of -- throughout the latter part of 2011, probably first 2 or 3 quarters of 2012, then I mean, the number bounced around between under 2% and under 4%, and kind of was heavily anchored around 3%. So we don't think that number was aggressive. We look -- we kind of look at the current -- what happened in the current quarter, what happened in the previous quarter and sort of what's the rolling fourth quarter average and [indiscernible] and just commentary on what we think is going on in the Street from investor bankers and other things. I don't think it was an aggressive assumption. I think it was very real and anchored in observable data. What changed in the fourth quarter was the observable data where we had the actual prepayments in the fourth quarter were significantly higher than 10% --", "Unknown Executive", "12%.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "12%. But we didn't -- it's kind of hard to go from 3.5%, 2.5%, 4% to 3%, 12%, and say well maybe we ought to go to 15% or go to 12%. So we moved it to 10% thinking that was a reasonable change based on what we observed and based on the fact that -- this change, by the way, only applied, remember, to the smaller banks, the ones that technically were not required under, I figure it was Basel or Dodd-Frank -- I think Dodd-Frank, to phase out trust-preferred, but for which the regulators proposed to phase them out over a 10-year period in lieu [indiscernible] that were issued early in the year or midyear but have not yet been made final. So David, you want to comment on anything else?", "W. David Hemingway", "I can say the 10% that you're referring to, while we raised it, even though the quarter was 12%, we raised it to 10%. It's only for 3 years, and then the model assumes that the prepayment rate drops back to 3%. And really, over the next 3 years, you're going to get a lot of input and clarity as to what's going to happen in this portfolios because the 5-year deferral period is up. We believe there's going to be a lot of sales of banks and debit transactions. I think probably 10% for 3 years is a reasonable assumption that we think once that these deferring banks get resolved, you could well see lower prepayments which is what's built into the model at the present time.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "And well within that time frame we should get a final rule from the Fed and others on whether or not smaller bank trust-preferreds will be phased out as Tier 1 Capital and, if so, over what time period.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right, that does help. And then just the other question I had, if you were to tender, do an early tender for your outstanding sub-debt, presumably you'd have to take all the, I guess, unamortized discount, I guess, as an accelerated amortization today, which would hit your equity by, I think, it's over $100 million or so. Would -- is it -- should we assume, unless current replacement capital or an equity raise would be needed, to support that accelerated amortization from the early tender? Or is that presumably something you could ask for in your stress test by regulators as sort of a give me given your earnings over the next year?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, again, I don't want to be dragged into what anything that's -- what's entered in our capital plan and stress test. I mean, you are correct in -- at the level of detail, at least, that you described that if you tendered and paid a premium to the current book value of debt, there would be an earnings and capital cost to doing so. I think that I would just offer to comment that it would seem, unless we paid a premium that you just couldn't refuse, it would be unlikely that we would give anything close to a full tender of the sub-debt. And I would just say, I think that we would -- I mean, for me it would be a very bad trade to pay a premium for a sub-debt and issue -- have the trade be issuing common at below book value.", "James R. Abbott", "And unlikely that we'd put that kind of thing in our capital play.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I realized that while you voted James #1, all of you, you demoted me this year. But I hope you don't think we're that stupid. I didn't realize how far I'd plummeted [indiscernible].", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.", "Brian Foran", "The 2% pref RWA target, I mean, I know you've said it over and over again. I think a lot of people probably were hoping you were being conservative. And I guess maybe one of the things a lot of us struggle with, Wells, which is a much bigger bank has been very explicit about 1.5% RWA pref target. Some of the banks who are more in your size range are still kind of holding out to hope they can get away with like 75 or 100 basis points. So why -- how should we think about -- do you think the whole industry eventually will be too? Or do you think your capital structure just will always be a little high on prefs. How should we think about you relative to the rest of the industry?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I would guess that if we look long term, 1.5% to 2% is not a bad place to be. The 2% is at the higher end of that range. I do -- it's really hard to get a gauge. I mean, if you simply read the Basel rules, and we've got close to 10% CET1, there's no reason to have any preferred. I mean, there's -- it absorbs no loss. I mean, I can understand your frustration. But I think from the regulators, the FDIC standpoint, it doesn't absorb loss for our shareholders. It's not ongoing. But it is a going concern, shouldering of lost to the FDIC. They're going to want to see it there. I do think you're going to see a lot of preferred issue this year in replacement of trust-preferred or just as issuance. And I think -- the whole -- we're 3.3% today and the industry is at 1.1%. We're going to come down, they're going to come up. And I think we'll all end up meeting somewhere between 1.5% and 2%. It's not a -- my 2% number is not a, \"Boy, I'm going to manage it every quarter to that number.\" But we're going to end up somewhere in that range.", "James R. Abbott", "One of the other advantages, Brian, is as you issue at these low rates you can fix in pricing. Presumably, loan growth and risk-weight assets growth will grow over time, so you can kind of grow into it. That's another possible reason why you might want to set a little higher, a little sooner.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes. That's why James is the #1 analyst.", "Brian Foran", "Fair enough. One follow-up on reserves and the potential for a negative provision in any given quarter. I guess 2 related questions. One, kind of how do you think about where reserve to loans is likely to trend over time? And then two, your reserve for unfunded commitment, I realize the provision is kind of a rounding error this quarter, but the stock is higher than most banks relative to your total outstanding unfunded commitments. So should we also think about that line item flipping to negative? Or you mentioned that commitments are growing pretty fast right now and other stuff that's going on that would keep that at 0 even if the provision was negative?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I will just point out and you can decide whether or not to give us credit for 2 facts. One, we're -- among our peers, we had just about the lowest charge-off rate or one of the very lowest charge-off rates this quarter, and we've got one of the highest loan loss reserves. Those 2 facts, and we've got one of the highest reserve on funding commitments relative. So I mean, you put all that together and it says there's very little pressure to boost reserves at this point. Our models and our process are going to drive it. There's not a specific number we're targeting toward, but we're -- I just can't point to anything on the horizon that says that there's a reserve build in the future for the next 2 quarters, and probably continue to drawdown some reserve. I can't find anything that points otherwise. One of my credit officers here staring at me from the other end of the table, but I'm a long way from him. He can't reach me right now.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I might also just note that the recoveries in the fourth quarter were particularly strong. I mean, whether you have negative provisions or not, maybe driven largely by what recoveries continue to look like. That's a predictable, vulnerable part of the equation. And that will be a big factor in our thinking.", "James R. Abbott", "We're going to probably end up going over time a little bit. So we'll maybe take the next 2 or 3 questions, but we will have to cut it off and call people back. I apologize, there are a number of questions remaining.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I would just -- question looking closer at loan totals. I was wondering if there was any chance of getting a breakdown of kind of new credit extensions and advances versus the amount of paydowns and maturities and how those amounts compare with last quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I made James take that out of the call script because it was already too long, and he told me somebody was going to answer that question. He's the #1 analyst.", "James R. Abbott", "All right. We had -- production was up quite a bit. It was up 16%, Joe, in the quarter and actually year-over-year. So if you're concerned about seasonality, we actually -- from a year-over-year perspective, it's just been a much stronger quarter. Yields were -- on CNI, yields were up a little bit. Some of the other products were down slightly on production. The yields are still dilutive to the existing book of business. But one little factor that I thought was interesting as I looked through all the data was that C&I -- the portfolio of C&I loans declined only 3 basis points in terms of yield this quarter compared to the third quarter. That is a really slow rate of decline compared to what it's been dropping in the past. And so we are getting close to the point where the production is converging with the portfolio.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then another quick question. Just besides the comp reversal or the accrual there, are there any other outsized or unusual items in the fourth quarter expenses you'd quantify, preferred to some legal matters or OREO expenses tied to?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Well, OREO expenses doesn't evolve. I think we told you last quarter it's unlikely to be that low the following quarter. Maybe -- but it's going to bounce around, it may go lower this quarter. Legal, go ahead.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "As you said, legal is probably up [ph]. I think the other noninterest expense line item was high and people have trouble reading that out.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Yes, and that's accrual for some -- I mean, about the cost of defending some cases and incurring for possible judgments or settlements. I'm obviously not going to get any more specific than that. But it's hard to know what will happen in future quarters on some of these. We certainly think we've reserved adequately. And if that turns out to be the case, that number will come back down because once you reserved it -- you don't reserve it, but if the future developments dictate, we may do it again. That's another one that's just hard to predict every quarter. But I don't think, there's -- you should not take that increase from third quarter to fourth quarter and trend line it in the legal and in the other expenses.", "Operator", "We have time for one final questioner. Our final question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I just want to follow up on that prior question about loans. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks about how some of these quarters, some originations had paid down after the quarter end. So just wondering, in that context, have you said that some of the deposits have gone out the door after the quarter? Can you give us some understanding of the -- on the loan side? That temporary increase, was it meaningful or was it modest?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think I can just give you the fact. So where are we? As of last Friday, so basically through the month of January, the $463 million increase in loans in the fourth quarter, most of which occurred in the last 4 to 6 weeks, was backed down by $100 million. Some categories still are growing like CMI. So it's not a complete reversal. On the other hand, the deposits were up, I think $2.5 billion and about $1.5 billion of that, back down about $1.5 billion in a month. Now we can't point to a long list of specific customers who drew down loans late in the year and then paid them back down. And we're not sure what that's all about, so those are the aggregate numbers we're talking about.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then so when you net that altogether, if you presume that that carries forward, you have presumably average loans that are going to grow and then -- but the average size of the balance sheet should shrink so...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Shouldn't that help the margin? I mean, why -- are we still going to see margin pressure even underneath all of that? And what would it be coming from that? Because I would think that your mix, your loan mix would be helping you get to that kind of NIM stability. So where are you still seeing the compression coming from underneath?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I told you where it was coming from. But I do agree with you, the stated NIM will benefit significantly from -- if the size of the cash assets funded by deposits shrinks back down. We've quantified in the prepared remarks that I think it was 5 basis points of margin compression was just -- you could just attribute it to the huge cash build-up during the quarter to the extent that reverses. That's a good offset to some of the other pressures. So I didn't want to -- I don't want to overstate the NIM compression in any 1 quarter going forward. I come back to -- for that and a whole bunch of other reasons, I think the NIM compression will be much more modest this year than last. If it occurs, most of it will be in the first half of the year, not that the last half of the year unless we see some dramatic change in loan pricing. And it will take half as much loan growth to completely offset it in terms of net interest income as we told you it would last year.", "James R. Abbott", "Yes, those [indiscernible] positives, I think.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And my last one is just on the characters -- I heard you walk through which lines you expect to grow within the loan buckets. But where are you seeing this -- within the C&I book or within the books you expect to grow, what's changing underneath the surface? Like where is the end demand change the most to the positive within that commercial side of the portfolio?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Energy.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Texas.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Texas has done well. Have you heard of frac-ing. I mean that's -- I mean -- by far the strongest is in Amegy, but it's pretty wide.", "James R. Abbott", "I was going to say, the energy loans are up about 5% over the last 6 months, not annualized. Finance, merger and acquisition related financing has also been strong. It was not a strong -- came from behind in the last month, but it was a strong month, December for finance. So those are a couple of the categories. Other categories are still doing well, but there are several -- there's only really one category that's down, which is construction-related businesses.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We can come back. Let me just kind of come back to one thing. One thing that gives me confidence that the decline, the run-up and then rundown in deposits was not TAG-related but also was kind of a onetime phenomena. We know of several very specific instances in which companies were sold late in the year and the deals closed in December because of an anticipated change in capital gains tax. I mean, you've heard about some of the high-profile things about movie studios. Lucasfilms being sold and things of that nature. But there are some closely held companies that we bank that -- and we got -- the companies were sold, the deal closed, a ton of cash came into their balance, to the owners of the company's balance sheet and then moved off fairly quickly. But there was a lot of \"let's do this now before rates maybe rise\" and of course, rates did rise subsequent to year end. And I think that's what we're -- a lot of that $2.5 billion up and $1.5 billion down is -- can be tied to that.", "I believe we'll have to wrap it up, moderator.", "Operator", "Sure thing. I'll turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.", "James R. Abbott", "Thanks, Siri, and thanks to all of you. We do have a list of those of you who are still waiting in the queue, and I will get back to you if you'll stay put. We'll get back to you tonight. Thanks for standing by, and thanks for your attendance on the call today. And we will see you at our conference sometime during the quarter.", "Harris H.

I would now turn the call over to James Abbott. Please go ahead.", "James R. Abbott", "Good evening, and thank you, Patrick. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2013 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to the statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Thank you very much, James, and we welcome all of you to the call today. It's been a very eventful quarter for Zions Bancorporation. We are pleased with the loan growth we've seen. This was the strongest quarter in terms of loan growth that we've experienced since the second quarter of 2008. So that's quite notable. We're also encouraged that loan pricing on new production improved, albeit very modestly compared to the prior quarter. Credit quality improved significantly during the past year. Noncurrent assets, which include nonperforming assets plus loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, improved by nearly 40%, including a 13% improvement in the fourth quarter.", "Additionally, I'm pretty happy to report that during the last year, the dollar amount of tangible common equity has increased 14%, approximately $500 million, and a fair amount of that is attributable to the value of the CDO portfolio improving, particularly during the fourth quarter. Zions has been in the news a lot lately regarding our CDO portfolio and the issuance and related implications of the Volcker Rule and the amendment or revision to it which was issued in January. Just last week, we announced our intent to sell a meaningful portion of our portfolio in an effort to materially reduce risk. And we believe that, that action will be materially beneficial to our capital ratios, particularly under a severe economic scenario in our stress tests.", "On the capital front, our GAAP common equity capital ratios increased compared to the prior quarter, with the tangible common equity rising to 8.0% from 7.9% despite the loss in the quarter. This is primarily attributable to the improvement in fair value of the CDO securities. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel I declined to 10.2% from 10.5%, predominantly due to the growth in loans, but also due to the decline in retained earnings from the 2 charges mentioned in the earnings release. We estimate that our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio will be comparable to the Basel I version at approximately 10.2%.", "And finally, just a brief comment about credit quality. I continue to be very encouraged with the results that we are seeing there. Our net charge-offs are among the lowest of our peer bank group, and our gross charge-offs are significantly below many of our peers' net charge-offs. This quarter, net charge-offs were only 20 basis points on average loans on an annualized basis. We're also pleased to see that the nonperforming asset ratio has fallen to 1.15% of total loans and real estate owned. That's a level that we haven't seen since 2007. So there's been a fair amount of noise, but a lot of underlying strengthening.", "And with that overview, I'll ask Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, good evening everyone. As noted in the release, the net income available to common for the full year was $294 million or $1.58 per diluted common share. For the fourth quarter, we posted a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $59.4 million or a loss of $0.32 per diluted common share. In the third quarter, we posted earnings of $209.7 million or $1.12 per common share. Of course, that quarter was -- included some unusual items related to the call of the Series C preferred stock and some other things that really inflated those earnings above what might be a normal run rate.", "This quarter, there are 2 significant items which I'll review here. And you can refer to last quarter's earnings release, the call transcript or SEC filings for the items in the third quarter. Of course, the CDO impairment charges were the most significant. I will set those aside just for the moment, come back to them later and discuss the other one that was related to the successful tender for $250 million of subordinated debt. This resulted in debt extinguishment charges of about $80 million, some of which related to the tender premium itself and the rest was attributable to accelerated discount amortization. Most of this debt, the $230 million par of the $250 million par amount had been significantly modified in 2009 to give the holders the option to convert to preferred stock. And thus, at the time, the carrying value of the debt was reduced significantly to reflect both the market pricing of the debt at that time. That was back in 2009, as well as the value of the so-called beneficial conversion feature. That is the right to convert to preferred. All of these we've discussed in great detail in the last several years of filings and conference calls if you need more color.", "The debt that was extinguished had a weighted average pretax cost for GAAP purposes of about 20% relative to the amortized cost amount of $192 million. And that, again, is related to the amortization of those discounts and features that I mentioned earlier. A related action was the issuance of $250 million of subordinated debt in September and November to prefund the November tender offer which had a weighted average cost of about 6%. Because of the timing, the full cost of the new issuance and the cost savings from the debt extinguishment was not fully reflected in the fourth quarter numbers, but will be for the first quarter of 2004.", "James R. Abbott", "'14.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "2014, yes, a decade here or there. We expect the net reduction of interest expense to be approximately $6 million in the first quarter relative to the interest expense on debt in the fourth quarter. The primary economic benefit to tendering for the debt early is not only the interest savings, but the ability to reduce idle cash balances at the parent company. We have a risk management practice of maintaining between 18 and 24 months of cash for any and all expected principal, interest and dividend payments, so-called time to required funding. And this practice is designed to greatly reduce liquidity and market access risk. By extinguishing this debt, which had less than 18 to 24 months left to maturity, we no longer need to hold idle cash to meet that liquidity objective. Further, to prevent the need for future tenders and associated tender premiums, much of the debt that we've issued in the last year or 2 has included a call feature at par, generally 2 years in advance of the maturity date, which is a practice that we plan to continue whenever market conditions make it possible.", "Turning now to the CDO portfolio, as Harris discussed briefly earlier, and as many of you are aware, the situation with the regulatory treatment and, therefore, the accounting treatment for the bank trust preferred CDO securities has been quite volatile. In response to the initial Volcker Rule publication on December 10, we determined and announced that we could be required to take impairment charges on most of this portfolio in a press release, an 8-K. I think on about December 19, we quantified that on a pro forma basis for you. However, as most of you probably know, the situation became increasingly uncertain over subsequent days and weeks as various parties clamored for a change in the rule's applicability to bank TruPS CDOs. Meanwhile, we were in the midst of preparing our CCAR 2014 submission, which we had to prepare based on the application of the Volcker Rule to our CDO portfolio as it was announced originally. In addition to the immediate GAAP effects of the Volcker Rule, as it was initially issued and as we described on December 16, there were quite severe impacts on stress losses attributable to that portfolio. This is because basically under the Volcker Rule, future declines in value that would be projected under very low probability but severe economic stress scenarios would now all go through OTTI and impact regulatory capital ratios. In previous year's stress tests using pre-Volcker accounting treatment for the CDO securities, a meaningful amount of such hypothetical value declines under severe stress primarily impacted -- or at least partially impacted only our estimate of unrealized loss on the securities that would be captured in AOCI and had a lesser impact on impairment charges that went through the income statement. And the latter is the driver of changes to regulatory capital. Therefore, we would have had to hold more risk capital against a very low probability stress outcome, while in the meantime, market prices for the securities had recovered significantly relative to a couple of years ago or even a few quarters ago. While we still expect further recovery in value of the CDOs, this may occur over several years. While the additional capital required against immediate 9 quarter stress losses, hypothetical stress losses, would have to be held now. For some of the CDOs then, it was more capital efficient to sell rather than continue to hold the securities. Hedge fund and other buyers that appear to be active in the CDO market did not have the capital considerations of the 9 quarter stress testing process or regulatory risk weightings. Ultimately, the Volcker Rule was modified, as you probably know, and a large number of our CDO securities, including substantially all of the bank -- mostly bank trust preferreds, were grandfathered and thus would provide the necessary time to allow fair values of such securities to rise to their amortized cost. However, these TruPS CDOs would still be a source of significant, albeit reduced capital strain under severe stress tests. Therefore, having already selected prior to December 31, the bulk of the securities that we felt would be capital efficient to sell based on the original Volcker Rule, despite the issuance of the Interim Final Rule, we elected to continue with our plan to sell a portion of the securities portfolio. Let me see here, further, the sale of the selected high-risk security should position the company to cancel the total return swap since the portion of the portfolio and risk covered by it will be much smaller after completions of the sales. Canceling the TRS will add approximately $22 million to annual pretax earnings per -- whenever canceled, perhaps in the third -- beginning in the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, we expect that the sales of the securities and related tax refunds using carryback treatment for ordinary losses generated by the sale of securities will add a few hundred million dollars of cash to the parent company, thus relieving the need to finance -- to refinance a like amount of maturing debt. Assuming an opportunity cost of 4% on the debt that we don't have to replace, that could be well north of $10 million in annual interest cost savings, perhaps in the -- roughly in the vicinity of $15 million, 1-5, not 5-0, $15 million of pretax savings. I expect there'll be follow-up questions on CDOs, so I'm going to move on to a few other topics now and leave that discussion.", "Next, I'll move to a review of some of the key revenue drivers. If you want to turn to Page 16 of the press release, average loans held for investment increased $442 million compared to the prior quarter. End-of-period loan balances increased $795 million, excluding FDIC-supported and held-for-sale loans. As Harris mentioned, that was the strongest growth we've seen in a quarter in a number of years.", "Also, unlike the last couple of years, that growth occurred fairly steadily throughout the quarter, although the weeks near the end of the year were a bit stronger still. We did see a modest reversal of the loan growth in the first couple of weeks of the first quarter of 2014, but again, nothing as severe as we've seen in the last 2 years. And at this point in January, loans are up a moderate amount relative to year-end, which we view as encouraging. If you recall, last year, we were already down several hundred million for the quarter at this point in time. And we have not seen anything like that kind of a runoff of the loan balances this year.", "Our lenders are reporting that small business optimism is starting to improve. And thus, we may see some mix shift away from middle-market loan production toward the smaller business production. Whereas virtually all the C&I loan growth during the past couple of years had come from loans with commitments greater than $5 million where pricing, as you know, is thinner than in small business loans. So even though there are some indications that larger loan growth may be beginning to moderate, an improvement in small business lending would generate a mix that would be favorable to the net interest margin. Again, that's an outlook based on sentiment and optimism, not something we've actually started to see in the numbers yet. Line utilization rates on revolving C&I loans increased slightly relative to the prior quarter to 32.8%, up from 32.2% at the end of the quarter -- prior quarter. And again, that slight -- that uptick, although slight, it's not something that we've seen for quite a few quarters.", "Before I leave Page 16, I believe it was, let me discuss the FDIC-supported loans and the income from that source. This is important to our outlook guidance, which is for stable to moderately declining net interest income over the coming year. We continue to experience quite strong performance of the loans in this portfolio. Prepayments continue to remain above our expectations and payoff values are well in excess of the prices we've marked the loans, which generates accelerated income in the yield of FDIC-supported loans. That was an annualized 37% for the fourth quarter or $33.8 million of total interest income. That's from loans that represent just 0.7% of total earning assets.", "Just 3 months ago, we expected the total remaining income from this portfolio to be roughly $95 million, the substantial majority of which would be recognized by the end of 2015. Even after the very strong fourth quarter results that I just mentioned, we revised our expectations to an estimate of more than $80 million yet remaining or, in other words, about a $20 million bump in the total expected revenue when factoring in those actual results from the fourth quarter. So while this income has significantly outperformed our expectations in the last few quarters, all good things must eventually end. And we know that this will eventually decline. And it could be fairly rapidly at some point as we come to the kind of the end of the workout periods for those loans. The indemnification asset expense related to this loan book, which is recognized in other noninterest expense, should amount to $23 million and be exhausted between now and the end of this year.", "Turning to the margin and net interest income. On Page 16, you'll note that the NIM increased considerably compared to the prior quarter, 11 basis points. Most of which -- most of that increase was attributable to the FDIC-supported loans, about 10 out of the 11 basis points. The growth in the loan portfolio and the slight reduction in cash contributed to the remaining lift in the NIM. Primary offset was the weaker yield on loans held for investment, again excluding the FDIC-supported loans. Although we ceased providing a core net interest income number, we did commit to giving you the components so that you could continue to calculate it. The additional accretion is found in the table at the bottom of Page 12 equaling $28.5 million, and the discount amortization on sub debt was $11.9 million. Adjusting for these factors, there was about a $2 million linked quarter increase in net interest income, marking the third consecutive quarterly increase, although it was slight.", "Turning to noninterest income after adjusting for the noise of the securities gains and losses. This is a pretty straightforward quarter with 2 notable items. First was the decline in loan sales and servicing, which is attributable to a drop in mortgage refinancing volume, which shouldn't come as a surprise to any of you. Our refi volume declined 47% sequentially and purchase volume declined 13%. The second item pertains to other noninterest income which dropped by $3 million. However, compared to the prior quarter -- however, that prior quarter included a $4 million gain on the sale of several branches from our California bank. So excluding this onetime third quarter item, other noninterest income was essentially flat.", "Looking at noninterest expense. We have guided to a number near $400 million, excluding the debt extinguishment charge. Making the extinguishment charge adjustment, total noninterest expense actually came in at $415 million compared to our guidance. Because of the acceleration of payoffs on FDIC-supported loans, the indemnification asset expense was higher than our expectations by $9 million. That's good news. It just happens to show up as bad news in noninterest expense because it was more than offset by the higher or stronger revenue that I -- from FDIC loans that I discussed previously. The remaining higher cost came from provision for unfunded commitments attributable to strong growth in that area. Most of the increase in professional fees was attributable to consulting and other efforts related to the preparation of our CCAR stress test submission.", "I'll wrap up now with an outlook. And that reminder that this outlook is kind of trying to look out over the course of the upcoming year, not just the current quarter and kind of as compared -- so the next 4 quarters, really, as compared to the most recent quarter. We're maintaining our outlook for loan growth to be slight to moderate over the 1-year horizon. Loans have continued to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace in the first quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter. We are hearing that, as I mentioned earlier, that pipelines for larger loan sizes have softened a bit compared to the recent past. And some of our banks are taking on -- are trying to take a more firm stance against pricing erosion. However, as I also noted, we're hearing that small business customers are becoming significantly more optimistic than they were 6 months ago, which may help drive loan growth a bit stronger than we saw in 2013.", "Net interest income. On a GAAP basis, including the effect of the expected declines in interest income from FDIC-supported loans, we expect net interest income to decline modestly. FDIC-supported loan income for the fourth quarter was $34 million. And we expect an average of only $12 million per quarter in 2014. In addition, although we're encouraged that new production yields did not decline further in the fourth quarter, we note that the weighted average yield on production this most recent quarter was around 3.8%, while the weighted average yield on the whole existing book is 4.4%. So there is downward pressure on loan yields, on average, even though at the margin, they have stabilized.", "Partially offsetting the pressure on the asset side of the balance sheet should be the benefit of extinguishing a significant amount of high cost subordinated debt and reducing other term debt expenses I mentioned earlier.", "For the noninterest income, we expect the less volatile components of noninterest income, such as service fees to continue their modest upward trend.", "On noninterest expense, we expect a decline in the first quarter due to a lack of debt extinguishment expense and perhaps some relief on the professional and legal services fees. There'll be the usual seasonal increases in health care and payroll taxes, primarily the latter, as well as some increase in salaries related to various projects, such as our core systems upgrade. Beyond the first quarter, we expect expenses to remain relatively stable at around $1.6 billion annually, with increases coming from the core systems upgrade, while offset by a continued reduction in credit-related and deposit insurance expenses. Variables, such as the provision for unfunded lending commitments and the FDIC indemnification asset expense, are difficult to forecast. We expect the provision expense, our provision for loan losses to remain modestly negative for perhaps at least another couple of quarters, although the negative provision probably will come to an end sometime after that if loan growth continues, even if with continued strong credit quality. Preferred dividends should be in the mid-$60 million area for the year 2014.", "With that, I will -- I leave in the opening soliloquy and ask the operator to open up the lines for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank.", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Given the comments you made on the TRS going away possibly by 3Q, I guess that means this is a part of the capital actions you submitted with your -- the CCAR this year? And do you actually need to complete the sales of those CDOs you marked before you think you can get rid of it?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'm not going to comment on exactly what was or wasn't in our CCAR submission. I'm just going to leave it as -- our expectation is, we will be able to sell it -- or excuse me, cancel it. Yes, and as we've mentioned, canceling it does in part result from de-risking the portfolio in these certain ways that I've described, kind of getting rid of some of the more capital inefficient ones for us to hold. And that does facilitate the potential termination of the TRS. I'm not sure there's -- I'm not sure I'd 100% say, if this, then that. That one is an absolute, both necessary and sufficient condition, but they're pretty strongly linked in our mind.", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Got it. And just one quick follow-up. You mentioned stable loan production rates this quarter, and that they're still lower than the book yield. But the book yield actually held up pretty well this quarter. I was just wondering if you can give any color as to what drove that greater stability this quarter versus what we've seen in the prior few quarters?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "James, do you want to comment, give any color on that?", "James R. Abbott", "Yes, we just -- I mean, we had a lower rate of prepayments this quarter. The yield on the production was up about 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter. That's unadjusted for mix, just the overall total production. Production was a little bit stronger than it was in the prior quarter, but nothing to write home about, per se, but both quarters had reasonably good production statistics, so. One of the loan types which is about 1/2 of our production typically is C&I. And the C&I production yield is equaling now roughly the yield on the C&I book. So that's actually helpful and probably a contributor to why the book yield did not decline quite as much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you can talk us through your -- the IT projects and in terms of helping us understand -- we're at this $400 million a quarter type of run rate level, and it seems like that's about the right rate to stay for a while. So can you kind of walk us through what still has to kind of come on board? And at what point you can finally start sunsetting some of the other pieces so that we can actually anticipate a decline from that $400 million level or so at some point?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, for this year, very roughly speaking, the ramp-up of expenses related to the core systems and accounting projects that we've described is still not fully there. I mean, actually the expenses related to those projects will be increasing somewhat this year. But some of the other costs that were noninterest expense, including some of the regulatory expenses and hopefully, that some of the other -- some of the consulting and other costs that were like related to CCAR should -- they won't go away, but they will decline from current levels. And that the goal is to roughly offset those. To have those 2 offset each other, to keep expenses flat to very modestly higher. But the first system sunsetting will not occur until the latter half of 2015. And that's when you will begin to see the savings in the latter half of '15 and then '16 and '17 from the core systems. It will take several years to go through each of the different loan systems to get those savings and consolidate some of the operations, et cetera.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And my follow-up question just relates to earning assets. And to your point that you expect to see slight to moderate growth on the loan side this year, can you talk to us a little bit about what you expect on the deposit side and whether or not you think loans will technically outgrow earning asset growth?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "So basically, another way to -- let me just sort of rephrase your question, make sure I got it. So you're asking, do we think loans will grow faster than deposits this year for the first time in a number of years? Is that...", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Basically, yes. And frankly, yes, do you expect -- because you guys had the possibility of mix shifting for a while on the cash side, but now there's the liquidity stuff, and you're not really building the securities book, so I'm just wondering how should we think about deposits to loans and deposits -- and loans to earning assets?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "The deposit, I mean I think we saw signs of deposit growth moderating in 2013 and I think we would expect, if the economy continues to slightly improve, I think we would expect to see those signs continue. And our free cash balances for the company as a whole are already down a couple of billion dollars from their peak, which was over 1 year ago, a rough -- kind of a couple of peaks over the course of early 2013, and maybe sometime in 2012. Though they're down a couple of billion dollars and we haven't added a lot of securities. So we are already seeing loan growth begin to absorb some of that. And that's our goal. I mean, securities, we would -- we only consider as a kind of an outlet for free cash that -- for which there is no loan demand, in an environment where [Audio Gap] largely to be unacceptable, and haven't invested a lot in securities. And I think -- I don't think there's any basic change in our stance. With this moderate loan growth, I think we'd probably will continue to absorb some of the excess cash over the course of this year, and not deploy a lot in the securities.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Really, my question's just a clarification for kind of understanding what really changed, that drove the stronger loan growth this quarter? It sounds like comparable production levels. Is it just that your overall level of paydown activity slowed in the quarter and, what kind of visibility you have towards that, going forward?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, that's -- in answer to the first part of your question, the answer is yes. I mean it -- there was a little bit of pickup in originations, but we've had higher than expected prepayment, not on Residential Mortgages, but on other loans for several quarters now and that prepayment rate slowed significantly in the fourth quarter. Hard -- and that, there's a sense that, that was potentially related to the uptick in long term -- longer term rates. Refinancing maybe wasn't as unbelievably attractive as it was in the third quarter and then the second quarter. But it's -- you ask what kind of visibility do we a have, it's cloudy and probably dependent on the further path of long-term rates. If you think they're going to -- despite the kind of coming down from the 3% level since year-end, if you think the trend is stable to drifting upward on long-term rates as the fed tapers, then you should probably expect that prepayments will continue to be lower. And if you're not that -- don't have that rate path in mind, then you might come to a different conclusion.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. The other question was just, can you give us a little more color on the improvement in the market values of the CDOs that you've seen, and just some of the liquidity in the market, too, that's giving you the encouragement now to maybe sell some of these?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes. We -- it was really interesting. I'll give you kind of what we can observe, a little of what we can observe directly, and then what we heard in the way of market color. What we observed directly was we actually put out for bid 2 different, relatively small groups of securities sales in December. One, kind of earlier in the month, and then one which we hadn't originally planned later in the month, but we wanted to validate -- some validation points on what the impact of the Volcker rule was, thinking that it's possible that it would have a negative impact. On the contrary, the prices that we got on 10 or 12 small tranches in late December were higher than what we got on some small tranches in early December. And the market color that we had was that, the Volcker rule actually sparked a lot of interest in an asset class that had sort of been ignored by a number of potential buyers who, because there hadn't been much trading, didn't perceive any ability to deploy much cash, and so had largely stayed out of it. But the possibility that there would be more sales by the current holders of them sparked a lot of interest by buyers, thinking that these -- there is a positive outlook for this particular security class and maybe we can buy enough of it to make it worth our while, to actually do the work and go through our internal processes and get involved in this market. That's what we were hearing from several dealers. That's kind of what we're -- we've heard in some direct calls, so.", "Harris H. Simmons", "I think combined with the fact that bank failure rates have clearly come way down and seem to be in pretty good control, and so the underlying quality is appearing to be much better than it was, say, 1 year ago.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, I think that's right. And again, there, I would draw your attention back to my comments where I tried to distinguish between the fact that bank failure rates are way down, deferrals are way down and by every objective measure, the quality of these securities is improving. But certain classes of holders have to pretend that none of that will continue starting tomorrow morning in a stress test, and that they will be buffeted by an extremely adverse event that has an extremely low probability of occurring. So -- but the -- if you're -- if you don't have to take that into account per se, then you might have a very different outlook on those securities, and I think that's what's going -- appears to be going on in the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Murray with ISI.", "Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Could you spend a second with an update on asset sensitivity or the duration of your deposits? You guys gave a lot of color on that in the third quarter. Was there any change in the fourth quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Not material, not materially, no. And we'll be -- I don't happen to have it in front of me to update, but I think we'll wait, under -- there's been no material change, and I think in the 10-K we'll give a complete kind of breakdown of all of that. We didn't deploy cash into long-dated securities, particularly those with negative convexity. A lot of our loan growth was in C&I loans, which have a relatively modest duration. The balance growth was in DDA, which is -- with a lot of it commercial DDA. So none of the underlying drivers changed materially.", "Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then on the credit side, give us a sense of what the recovery pipeline looks like, and any color you could provide around the very small pickup in C&I charge-offs that just -- poised to run in such a low base right now?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, you're at such a low base that kind of any charge-off now can affect the net amount, and we had -- we kind of had one $7.5 million kind of charge-off that alone, by itself, was almost equal to all of the charge-offs last quarter. So you're just in a volatile -- at a point where any normal C&I charge-off can move -- can double or halve the net charge-off rate, and that's all it was. All of the underlying drivers are fundamentally positive.", "Harris H. Simmons", "It's hard to say that when we expect the level of net charge-offs to remain quite low through the course of this year. But at those very low levels, you could see some volatility. I mean, it could be 10 basis points, 25 basis points the next quarter. I mean, it's going to bump around, just because you're at a...", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I think the -- what you -- I would suggest you focus on is the fact that all of the metrics for -- that we disclosed for -- around credit quality other than net charge-offs continue to improve, and we continue to release reserves by providing -- had a negative provision this quarter. We would not have had that had we seen some underlying indicator that the favorable trends were about to reverse. With regard to recoveries, there's not that much in the way of recoveries out there. There will continue to be some. This volatility was driven by a -- 1 or 2 single charge-offs.", "James R. Abbott", "This is James. I'll just add real quick that from a flow perspective of the inflows into the nonaccruals and classifieds, those are down substantially from the prior quarter's rate and the favorable resolutions, which are payoffs and paydowns as opposed to charge-offs, favorable resolutions on the classified loans were 94% of the total resolutions that we processed this quarter. So it was really a very, very strong quarter from that perspective, and similar types of levels for the non-performing assets as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "The total returns swap cancellation that will come out of noninterest expense?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It's a net interest income.", "James R. Abbott", "Not non-interest income.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It is? Okay, I'm sorry. Yes.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Noninterest income?", "Harris H. Simmons", "Jennifer, it's on the -- the line item that it shows up is the fair value and nonhedged derivative loss. So it was a -- I think it's $5.2 million. And then the line item this quarter shows $5.3 million negative. But it's in the fee income section.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My question is just a follow-up to Ken Usdin's question on the expenses. So as we put together your outlook for the year, it seems like, give or take, we're going to come out to a core efficiency ratio of about 70%. As we look beyond this year, and think about the efficiency improvements that can come out, especially from the IT spending, and some of the CCAR expenses going away, in a revenue backdrop where your loan growth is getting better and the yield curve is steepening, where can we expect your midterm efficiency ratio to settle out to, without assuming any movement on the short end?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I don't have a number to give you. Sorry. It's -- there's no reason, long-term, that we should have an efficiency ratio materially different from other regional banks. I'll just leave it at -- wherever they are, is probably where we're going to end up. That the, again, the goal is to kind of keep expenses as flat as we can for the next 1.5 years, while we absorb these very large project expenses and then let the combination of the expense reductions, as we do phase out the old systems in the latter half of '15 into '16, and the effect of rising loan growth and interest rates, impact our asset sensitive position kind of over the same time period. It's -- in my view, it's not just an expense issue. It's also a revenue issue. We could \"fix\" the efficiency ratio really quickly, by buying several billion dollars of mortgage-backed securities and pumping up the revenue as a number of institutions have done, but we've elected not to do that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the C&I growth in the quarter, up 5% linked quarter. I know you implied that a lot of the loan progress on the commercial side was from the lower paydowns. So can you just give us an expectation on the real -- where you're seeing the improvement and then, how can we think about the pace of C&I growth going forward? It probably can't stay at the 5% linked quarter pace, I'm assuming.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, I'd just point out to start, and I'll probably ask James if he has any additional color, but I'll point out, in the release itself, we've noted geographically where the loan growth had come from by, which of our states if -- I would also note that fourth quarter, almost every year is this -- is by margin, the strongest loan growth quarter we have. There's a high degree of seasonality in the pattern of our loan growth. So that's -- so just from that loan, I would say yes, it's probably not sustainable. But I tried to mention, what's interesting is that the growth in the quarter was not just in the last few weeks, like 3 or 4 weeks the way it was last year, and the year before. It occurred rather -- throughout the quarter, with still some noticeable increase in the last few weeks, but not nearly as severe. We would have had a very good quarter if we just cut it off around -- in early December. At the same time, we haven't seen the runoff of the spike up in the first quarter so far. It hasn't continued with strong loan growth but remember, last year, we were down $0.5 billion in the first quarter, and I don't remember the number from 2012 Q1, but it was also hundreds of millions of dollars down. So far, at least, we do not appear to be on a course that's going to get us to a down quarter. It may be flattish, but that would be a huge improvement over the last few years. It's up, not quite $50 million through whatever it was last Friday, just for the -- for -- since year end for the month of January, just to give you a little bit of perspective. So with that, James, you have any color on what, where, when, how?", "James R. Abbott", "Well, John, it was really a strong quarter, obviously for C&I, and it was really across the board. I mean, we had -- Nevada had $86 million worth of growth in C&I, for example, and Nevada's a smaller bank for us, and has not had the strongest economy. So that kind of gives you -- put that in context there. California's $127 million worth of growth. Texas, $224 million. So it was really quite strong, and the number of the franchises -- the one, actually, franchise that stands out is the Utah, Idaho franchise, Zions National -- First National Bank or Zions Bank, and that was only up $16 million. So there are -- there, it's -- we weren't firing on maybe all the cylinders, but we were firing on most of the cylinders in the quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Before there's a follow-up question on what on earth are we finding to lend to on Nevada, I'd just caution that some of that growth that James articulated is internal participations bought from our own banks in order to kind of, manage liquidity internally. Nevada has a lot of excess deposits at the moment that we're trying to put to deploy.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is really around the margin. We just want to get your thoughts around how we should expect the core margin, excluding any purchase accounting-related impacts? How we should expect that to trend in coming quarters? Is it fair to assume ongoing pressure, given the new loans are still coming on well below the book yield?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "You've got what, 60 basis points of difference between the average yield and the marginal yield. In a loan book that has a, I don't know, kind of an average pricing period of 1.5 years to 2 years. So if you divide -- keep it simple, divide 60 by 8 quarters, you're at 7 to 8 basis points per -- 7.5 basis points a quarter of pressure. If everything stays stable, right where it is, you can calculate yourself that to offset that much pressure on loan growth at 3.8 would take a few hundred million dollars of loan growth to offset it. So the most -- net-net, most of the pressure that we can't offset is in the FDIC-supported loans. That's the -- that's sort of the unmitigatable drag, if you will. The core margin with some modest loan growth, maybe close to stable. It was up 1 or 2 basis points this last quarter. I mean, that's just some high-level math I'm doing on the fly here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "You made a comment at the end of your opening statements about loan growth being better at the mid-tier firms versus the large firms, and that some of the bigger banks now are not being as competitive on pricing. Can you add any more color to that?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Not a lot. I mean...", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I guess the question is, some of the bigger guys were very aggressive on pricing, with the higher yield curve. Is that -- some of that pressure going away?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I -- personally, I think it's probably too soon to call a trend or turn there. I hope so, but, I don't know.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Probably one of the things that will be interesting, Paul, is to see whether the biggest banks start pushing the capital that they're holding in the parent company down to their pricing models. Because when pricing models are based on 7% common equity, and everybody's holding 10, it makes you look like you can push pricing down. I think people are starting to understand that dynamic. I know that we're talking about it. And so you may, at some point, start to see that happen among the biggest banks and, of course, they're the price leaders.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And then, a second question: You have a pretty diverse geographic region. Is there any area that's doing better than others? We know Texas is doing well, but how's Vegas and California for loan growth? I mean, are you seeing the same across all of your banks? Or is one group doing better than the other?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We'll let Harris take that, because he's just been around to most of them.", "Harris H. Simmons", "Well, I'd say that it's -- I mean it still varies. Las Vegas is certainly getting better. That's -- as Doyle said, we've been selling participations to them because they have a lot of liquidity, but they're also seeing better loan production there, small business lending is actually coming along pretty nicely there. We're seeing, certainly in the Arizona market, things have -- not just this past quarter. I -- in fact, I don't know that I've seen the numbers this quarter or I haven't focused on them. But generally speaking, that's a market where we've seen quite a lot of improvement, in terms of production. We've seen good growth in Colorado. So it's kind of across the board. In Utah, Idaho market, which is an important market for us, we have kind of a, some run off portfolio there that is offsetting underlying growth. But beneath that, they're actually seeing some pretty good production. So, I guess we talked earlier about prepayments coming down. I mean, I -- the same factors are in effect there, I think, that are -- that you're seeing with residential mortgage refinancing. I mean, it's -- some point, it kind of runs its course, and I think a lot of that, probably a lot of the steam has gone out of the refi market in the commercial term CRE segment. So hopefully, that bodes well for a little better net growth going forward and...", "James R. Abbott", "I'll just mention real quick that we -- just looking at the -- talk about what Harris is mentioning on the prepayments activity, we saw about 70, almost $80 million worth of loan growth out of the commercial, of the term commercial real estate portfolio this quarter. The prepayments on that portfolio were $100 million less than they were in the prior quarter. So if we, just see no change in prepayments, we would have actually had a little bit of attrition, which is what we'd seen for several quarters out of that commercial real estate portfolio. So, it really was just a prepayment activity, the prepayments being dropped from 32% last quarter to about 27% this quarter, and that's just one example, but you see it in the C&I portfolio as well and others.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Operator, I think we have a couple left, and we'll try to give short answers and then wrap it up promptly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question. I wonder if -- looking at the schedules on Page 4 of the release for the CDOs, I don't think you guys have actually given any more guidance, as far as level of the planned sale for these CDOs. I guess if you just look at the reduction in amortized cost from September to December, and with that, looking at the $220 million pretax impairment charges, it does kind of seem the nonperforming CDOs would be a big portion of what I would -- what took the additional impairments. So is there any way that we should be thinking about the movements within that last fourth quarter for the OTTI and trying to back into a level of, what you guys are planning to sell here?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I'm not going to help you at all. We're trying to back into that number. We'll talk about that when we've done what we planned to do. What I will tell you is that, that includes the impairment from several sources, CDOs that we still have to sell per Volcker, or not have to sell, we at least have to -- can no longer say they're AFS, or can't, we can't necessarily recover our amortized cost that comes from a little bit that would've occurred due to a weakness in a particular bank issuer that would've cost some OTTI, had no Volcker, and that's an -- and it's an estimate of -- from CDOs that we may attempt to sell, and -- but I am, for reasons I think you can probably understand, I'm not going to give you the breakdown of that.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Got you, got you. And then just a quick question, the security's portfolio, AFS, looks like you added to that securities portfolio during the quarter?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That's a transfer from held-to-maturity on some -- as I mentioned, there are some securities that even after the amendment or with your interim final rule to modify the final rule, that we are not allowed to hold to maturity. We have to sell. So yes, there's some movement that was still required from HTM to AFS. And then there were some sales that we did in the fourth quarter as well.", "Harris H. Simmons", "And let me just add. If you're looking on Page 9, maybe it's easier for me to point it out on a comparative balance sheet, you'll see that in fact, the accumulated other comprehensive income, as we've stated, went from a negative $384 million to $192 million negative, and the fact of the matter is, that means that the available for sale securities went up. I mean these offset each other. The available for sale securities in the balance sheet are on the books at market value. Since there's been a dramatic increase in the market value, you can see that the securities number went up there. There were not many purchases, it was a change -- that's the change.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Doyle, just quickly on the expense outlook. You mentioned that on a GAAP basis, expenses would be down year-over-year, and I was wondering -- just wanted -- if you could give a little bit more perspective on the unfunded lending commitments? That's kind of been volatile quarter-to-quarter. The last quarter, I think you had one of your weaker quarters on production, and now we're looking at one of the better quarters. I'm just trying to figure out, just from more of a modeling standpoint, how you're thinking about that with your kind of modest loan growth outlook, in conjunction with the likelihood that the professional's going to come down, and you're looking at kind of a more stable run rate the rest of the year?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, Todd, I think I mentioned, and trying to go through the expense outlook that I wasn't including a couple of volatile elements, notably the unfunded commitments. I would remind you, I believe it was last quarter, third quarter, that we had a onetime change in the way in which we estimated that provision. We basically switched from using some allowed metrics under Basel rules. There were some -- you can default a certain assumed draw down rates, and we had been using that because of a lack of data. As we accumulated data, we switched over to using our own historical experience. That's what drove the decline last quarter, not a weakness in originations. I think maybe, something like this quarter is more -- is maybe a little strong in the way of originations, but something in the low to mid-single digits might be a reasonable estimate for the unfunded commitment provision, positive, not negative, on -- as a per quarter, for a run-rate basis. Does that help you?", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I appreciate the clarification. That's very helpful, thanks.", "Operator", "This ends our Q&A session. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks.", "James R. Abbott", "Well thank you very much, Patrick, and thank you, everyone for participating today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to get in touch with me and the information is on the zionsbancorporation.com website and we will see you at a conference or otherwise next quarter.", "Doyle L.

Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to your Zions Bancorporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time all participants will be in a listen-only mode but later there will be a chance to ask questions and instructions will be given at that time (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And now I would like to turn it over to your host James Abbott. ", "James R. Abbott ", "Good evening, and thanks, John. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our first quarter 2014 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. (Operator Instructions). ", "With that I will now turn it over to Harris.", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Thanks very much, James, and welcome all of you who are on the call today. I would start by saying that we are generally pleased with most of the facets of the quarterly results. And especially pleased with the significant reduction in our CDO exposure which has been a long time coming. It represents a significant improvement to the risk profile of the company. ", "However, our comprehensive capital analysis and review or CCAR results have been probably much more impactful to our recent stock price than the actual fundamental results we're announcing today will be -- I'll address that briefly recognizing the communications with the regulators is required to be kept confidential. ", "But what I can say is that as we announced on March 20, under the results published by the Federal Reserve under the hypothetical severely adverse economic stress scenario in the Dodd Frank Act stress test to the DFAST test run by the -- as it was run by the Federal Reserve, Zions' capital ratios would not have met the minimum requirements under the Federal Reserve's capital adequacy rules. ", "The credit loss rates that were rejected by the Federal Reserve's model for Zions were broadly similar to the loss rates projected for other CCAR banks, even if they were much higher than the loss rates that we projected. However, the Federal Reserve's models projected much lower pretax pre-provision net revenue than for other banks relative to the run-rates immediately prior to the beginning of the stress test period. And those rates were much lower than Zions' experienced in 2008 through 2010 recession. ", "Our own models produced significantly different results from those of the Federal Reserve. We remain quite confident that under an actual severely adverse economic environment and with no access to the capital markets Zions would remain comfortably above the threshold of 5% Tier 1 common equity as a percentage of risk weighted assets. Even before the Federal Reserve publication of its DFAST stress test results Zions had informed the Federal Reserve that it intended to resubmit its capital plan. This resubmission will incorporate the effects of the nearly $1 billion in par value of CDO sales accomplished during the first quarter and of the Interim Final Volcker rule published after Zions CCAR submission.", "The Interim Final Volcker rule removed the requirement that Zions divest its primarily bank trust preferred CDOs. The CDOs sold were selected because they either had the most risk of impairment under a severely adverse scenario, the highest risk weights or were prohibited by the Volcker rule even after modification by the Interim Final rule. By about the end of this month we expect to have submitted that revised capital plan which will project significantly better stress tests -- better stressed capital ratios due to the CDO sales in the Interim Final Volcker rule. However, we will not comment on any further capital actions until the resubmission and review process is complete. ", "Just summarizing, our net interest income on loans situation, we return to the financial results for the quarter; Net interest income was largely unchanged compared to the year-ago period. Although flat revenue certainly is not our goal, given the persistently low interest rate environment and the pressure that places on our net interest margin and the significantly declining contribution from the FDIC indemnified loans we're encouraged with the roll out of stability. ", "We experienced strong average loan growth in the first quarter which is mostly attributable to strong fourth quarter period end growth. Although, we are pleased with the strong fourth quarter growth, didn't reverse itself as it has frequently done in previous first quarter periods. Our loan growth outlook remains unchanged which is to say we expect to see slight to moderately increasing loan volumes as we go through 2014. ", "Credit quality is strong and the trends are stable. Our loan net charge-off ratio remains one of the best in the industry at eight basis points of total loans on an annualized basis. Non-performing assets improved slightly while our classified loans increased slightly, both we think are fluctuations within what we would call statistical noise ranges. We think that quality is actually pretty stable and at a pretty good place right now. ", "Speaking to capital, our GAAP common equity capital ratios increased compared to the prior quarter with the tangible common equity ratio rising to 8.2% from 8.0% last quarter. The Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel I improved to 10.5% from 10.2% and we estimate our Basel III common equity Tier I ratio to be approximately 10.3%. ", "We announced in today's press release that we canceled the total return swap effective April 28 which will result in an increase in the risk weightings on some of our CDO securities in the second quarter. If the total return swap had been canceled at March 31 risk weighted assets would have been approximately $1.1 billion higher and the Basel I Tier 1 common ratio would have been approximately 10.25%. The benefit of canceling the total return swap will increase pre-provision net revenue by approximately $22 million annually. ", "With that general overview I'll turn the time over to Doyle Arnold and ask him to review the quarterly financial performance in little more detail. Doyle?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon and good evening everyone. For the first quarter of 2014, as noted in the press release we posted net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $76.2 million or $0.41 per diluted common share. That compares to a net loss of $59.4 million or $0.32 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter. I'm sure you'll recall that the fourth quarter results included two particularly significant items, namely the impairment of a portion of the CDO securities related to the Volcker rule as it then applied and the debt extinguishment charge which reduced earnings by $0.74 a share. ", "Those items did not reoccur in the first quarter. However in the first quarter we did recognize a $31 million pretax gain on fixed income securities or about $0.10 a share, as discussed in the release and I will touch on again later that related to the substantial de-risking of the CDO portfolio sales that Harris mentioned. ", "Zion\u2019s net interest income was in line with consensus expectations. Non-interest income and expense variances largely offset each other. The primary variants between the consensus estimate of $0.42 a share and the GAAP EPS of -- that we reported of $0.41, less the $0.10 gain on securities sold would appear to involve two main factors. A smaller amount of reserve released this quarter and a higher preferred stock dividend than we had perhaps led you to expect, I will touch on that in a minute. The relatively small reserve released does not reflect any change in our outlook about credit quality and barring some unforeseen change we currently anticipate somewhat larger reserve releases in the next couple of quarters. ", "The higher preferred stock dividend is attributed to the issuance in 2013 of two series of preferred stock on which the dividend payments are semiannual instead of quarterly. Ordinary the semiannual dividends alternate quarters and the amounts are similar and thus going forward they should be relatively neutral to ongoing EPS calculations but the first declaration on one particular issue, which effectively involved two quarters of dividends did create some noise which was about $0.05 per share more relative to expectations. ", "Now I\u2019ll move onto some of the key revenue drivers, turning to page 14, the table in the press, release average loans held for investment increased $545 million compared to the prior quarter and ending loan balances increased $220 million. We are so far in April experiencing an improved growth rate although it\u2019s early in the quarter, we expect it to continue, based on reports from our various lending groups. ", "Zion\u2019s loan growth is being constrained in some cases by self-imposed concentration limits, particularly on some types of real estate loans at some markets and if the company did not have such limits loan growth rates would be even stronger. In part because of concentration limits we are able to be more selective on the deals we do accept, slower to cut pricing or loosen underwriting standards for example. We are encouraged by recent reports that the outlook for capital expenditure spending for both large and small businesses is on the rise and we are optimistic that small businesses in some markets are becoming more active borrowers. ", "Smaller C&I loans defined by us as commitments less than $5 million accounted for 56% of the quarterly C&I production in the first quarter, which was up from 49% in the year-ago period. Smaller C&I production volume increased 13% relative to the year ago period while larger production volume declined 17%. As some of you may recall we kind of keep loosely tracking -- we loosely track these kinds of statistics because the pricing on the smaller loans is generally a bit better than on the larger loans. ", "Moving on to new loan production we are encouraged that loan pricing on new production does overall remain essentially stable compared to the prior quarter. Nonetheless the yield on the loan portfolio excluding the FDIC supported loans declined 11 basis points to 4.30% from 4.41% in the prior quarter. Most of the compression was the result of the coupon on new production equaling less than that of the portfolio as a whole. ", "We are likely to experience additional compression for the next several quarters. For the same reason although the portfolio yield -- as the portfolio yield converges with the production yield that compression should become less than that experienced in the first quarter. ", "Line utilization rates on revolving C&I loans were relatively stable at 32%. Unfunded commitment growth increased more than $300 million or about an 8% annualized rate which also bodes well for future balanced growth. Within the unfunded commitment growth commercial real estate commitments declined while C&I and consumer expanded. ", "Let me discuss the FDIC-supported loans and the income from that source, as I've done in the past, that they will come in a few more quarters when we won't talk about this anymore because we're nearing the end of that rather happy experience that we had over the last five years. We continue to experience quite strong performance of the loans in this portfolio, although on a steadily declining balance. ", "Pay-off values are well in excess of the prices to which we have marked the loans and pre-payments continue to remain above expectations, which generates accelerated income and enhances the yield of the FDIC-supported loans, which was an annualized 29% for the first quarter or $23 million of total interest income. That's about 6% of total net interest income yet the loans represent just 0.6% of total interest earning assets. ", "Just three months ago we had expected the total remaining income from this portfolio to be roughly $80 million, the substantial majority of which would be recognized by the end of 2015. The updated numbers now are more than $87 million of which about $23 million was recognized in the first quarter and it's -- as I said it's certainly encouraging the CD additional income but we know that eventually it will decline and that decline could be rapid. The indemnification asset related to this loan book, which is recognized as a sub component of other non-interest expense should amount to a total of about $10 million and be exhausted between now and the end of this year. Most of that will happen in the second quarter. ", "Turning now to margin, net interest income, page 14 of the release you will note that the NIM declined two basis points compared to the prior quarter. The change in the mix of the asset base, higher average balance of loans and the reduced balance of cash contributed to the stability and the reported NIM as well as the decline in the cost of long-term debt. As you know we've been retiring through tender or maturities the more expensive debt that was issued in the 2009-2010 timeframe. ", "On page nine total net interest income was $416 million, down from $432 in the prior quarter. Although we have ceased providing a core \"net interest income number\" we did commit to give you the components so that you could calculate it if you wish. The additional accretion is found on the table at the bottom of the page 10 equaling $18.5 million and the discount amortization on subordinated debt was $8 million. Adjusting for these factors there was about $9 million linked-quarter decrease in net interest income, which is essentially entirely related to the difference in day count, two fewer days at about $4.5 million per day. The margin, if you adjust for those same factors actually increased slightly. ", "Turning now to non-interest income, also on page nine, after adjusting for the noise, positive noise of the securities gains, we experienced some further pressure on some of the core items although these items also are affected by seasonal factors related to softer volume in the first quarter of this year. This would apply for example to other service charges, commissions and fees. ", "The dividends and other investment income line was adversely impacted by a lack of income from several private equity investments, primarily at Amegy. While this quarter was unusual in that area and some income may be recognized in the near future, as we liquidate the fund investments prohibited by the Volcker rule in the medium term that revenue source should decline to roughly the first quarter level. ", "The fair value non-hedged derivative line included a contra revenue item primarily related to the total return swap, which as we noted -- Harris noted we have canceled effective next week. So this amount will fall to about a $0.5 million in the second quarter and will be zero thereafter. ", "Turning to non-interest expense, again on page nine, salaries and benefits increased by $6.8 million. Most of that is seasonal, about $5 million for payroll taxes, $2 million for medical insurance. Legal and professional services expense declined significantly to $11 million from $24 million with most of the difference coming from consulting costs related to the CCAR process. We do expect to incur an increase in those consulting kinds of expenses in the second quarter and in the second half as we further upgrade our stress testing processes. ", "We also experienced some relief on the legal expense front by about $3 million, although that line can be volatile depending on the timing of what's going on in specific cases. The decline in other non-interest expense is largely attributable to the decline in the FDIC indemnification asset amortization pricing at three times quickly and regulatory related expenses.", "So summing up now with a little bit of a outlook commentary. The outlook again is kind of what would we expect in general over the next four quarters or so relative to the most recent quarter. For loan growth we're maintaining our slight to moderate growth outlook for loans over the one year horizon. And as I've mentioned loans have continued to grow thus far in April with strong performance in C&I and residential mortgage, partially offset by a net decline in commercial real estate. So we're reasonably comfortable with that guidance. ", "Net interest income on a GAAP basis, including the effect of an expected decline in interest income from FDIC-supported loans we would expect to remain relatively stable. Pressure should come from further declines in the FDIC-supported loan interest income and loans maturing that are replaced with loans at lower yields. As we get further out in 2014 and early '15 we expect that loan growth and higher cost senior and subordinated debt payoffs will offset much of the pressure. ", "Furthermore as we remain rather asset sensitive we're in a position to modify the duration of equity, lengthen it a bit, which would generate a small amount of incremental net interest income and we've been very selectively doing a little of that through both asset and liability swaps in recent months.", "Excluding FDIC-supported loan income we actually would expect net interest income to increase moderately over the next year but again that's excluding the drag from the FDIC income kind of winding down. On the non-interest income lines we expect the less volatile components of non-interest income such as service fees to continue at a modest upward trend as we press our mortgage initiatives and enhance treasury management product penetration. ", "On non-interest expense we would expect that to remain relatively stable at around $1.6 billion, annually with increases coming related to the core systems replacement project, continued CCAR-related expenses and somewhat offset by continued reduction in credit related and deposit insurance expenses.", "Provision expense we expect it to remain negative for another couple of quarters and again as I mentioned earlier probably somewhat more so in the first quarter, our net loan loss rates have been among the best of the regional banks and declining and some of the global economic concerns that have led us maintain a higher reserve seems to be fading into the past which makes it increasingly difficult to support having one of the proportionally largest reserves in the industry. ", "Preferred stock dividends should run in the $15 million to $16 million per quarter into the foreseeable future after the one time catch-up accrual in the first quarter. ", "With that I think that\u2019s enough of an opening soliloquy from me and Harris and we will allow John to moderate or queue up your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our first question from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Ken please go ahead.", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Hey, Ken. Ken?", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ", "Sorry. I was on mute. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Okay.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ", "Quick question for you, in terms of, Doyle you mentioned that you're lessening the duration of your equity, but you mentioned swaps, can you just address a little bit more like how do you guys think about investing the cash, just an outright move from fed funds into say MBS versus swaps and why not do that versus the swaps?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well, as you could do -- you can actually do neither, either or both. We are mindful of the LCR ratio and we have far less than the total amount of cash is truly free. I mean we could deploy it into treasury securities without penalty but if you deploy it even in the mortgage bag share I think incurring some penalty on the LCR, not to mention the interest rate risk negatives can actually associated with that. So you know we actually have to -- we and all banks we are going to have to remain much more liquid than we have in the past and we have chosen to keep a lot of it in very short term cash. ", "The swaps are -- I mean it\u2019s pretty straight forward. You could do interest rate swaps on loans, take floating rate prime or LIBOR-based and swap for received fixed contracts. We have done a little bit of that or even to do the opposite, make the opposite trade on your own debt and we have done, are in process doing a little bit of that. Again we don't want to give up the entire asset sensitive position, certainly not in this interest rate environment and we certainly don't want to lock away a lot of cash and very long duration assets with negative convexity risk. So that\u2019s kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about it. Anybody of my colleagues want to come? Okay, I am getting all good on our end. How about your end, Ken?", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ", "Yeah, I think I was good on the swaps right now. Just as a follow-up, the fee line you mentioned that it was going to increase modestly but I guess this quarter it sort of declined a fair bit more than what we are looking forward. When you talk about a modest increase in fees is that adjusting for seasonality or should we assume a step-up in fees next quarter and then increase modestly or is it really increasing off of this lower base at a slow pace. Thanks. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, it\u2019s a hard one there. I think it\u2019s fair to say we were a little surprised that, I don't know if weaknesses is the right word but just the fact that fee income was just a little soft to our normal lines, that\u2019s not our real expectation. Going forward as we have talked about we are putting a whole lot of effort in to growing wealth management, mortgage lending, treasury management and some other things like that. So we are a bit surprised that it didn't show up a little more here. I would hope that -- I think our hope is that this is not a new base from which we have to claw back with a little bit of softness. Of course you know the big line -- the fair value non-hedged derivative line, that\u2019s the swap, the TRS is a big driver of that line. So that negative line will be a whole lot smaller next quarter. ", "Anybody you want to comment any further on that, Okay.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay, so sounds like your data, your fee line shouldn't be that materially different from the industry because I think there has been a pretty big trend of everyone fees being a lot weaker and everyone expecting higher fees in second quarter, it sounds like you are pretty much in line with the rest of the banks in that regard, aside from the TRS of course.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yeah, I will take your word for it because I just haven't had time to study the others and I know you've been absorbed with them, so I'll take a word for you. ", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ", "All right. Fair enough, thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. And we'll take our next question from Brad Milsaps from Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP.", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Hello, Brad. Brad? Might be on mute. ", "Operator", "If you could just check your mute button, your line is open. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Why don't we take somebody else and go back to Brad. ", "Operator", "Yeah, we'll go with the next question from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. ", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, guys. May be just to hit on CRE first, you guys put a pretty decent construction loan growth, can you give us any detail on what type of loans you are adding and also what type of loans you are running off, whether they are going to life insurance industry or CNBS Conduits? ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "We're going to let Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer field that one for you, Craig. ", "Michael Morris", "Thanks. Most of the CRE balance growth has come from construction loans put on through the cycle. We're not seeing the kind of commitment increases in CRE that we've seen in balances and those are just loan balances that are catching up, a lot of that was multi-family. We feel good about our multi-family exposure and so the CRE balance growth that you've seen are mostly, I would say 2012-2013 vintage. They are now starting to ripen, starting to stabilize and will be moving to term. ", "With respect to the take out markets, it is competitive. We do see term loans roll off, some of which we would prefer would stay but it's very competitive on the rate side and we are, as you probably know a recourse lender and most of the life companies and CNBS lenders and Conduits offer non-recourse loans. And then are the GSEs and the agencies, they are doing most of the multi-family and that's very tough to compete with. ", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, and just a follow up. Can you give us what the actual yield was on loans you added in the first quarter and also give us a range for the loan to value ratios? ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Craig, are you referring to commercial real estate? ", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "So aggregate commercial real estate, which includes construction. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "So I've got -- Craig I can give it to you on -- I've got it broken down by commercial term and then construction but on term it was an overall yield of about 370. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "And that was on new loan. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "On new in production, on term commercial real estate. And on construction the yield on -- in production for the quarter was about 350.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "And any color on LTVs? ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Weighted average LTV of the existing portfolio, which would include construction is going to be somewhere in the 60s somewhere in the mid-60s. We are seeing may be a little bit on the new loan growth, little higher advance rate, perhaps pushing 70. ", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "All right, great guys. Thanks for taking my questions. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies LLC. Ken, please go ahead. ", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company LLC", "Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Harris, just to follow on your points, understanding that your conversations with the regulators about CCAR are confidential but just from a process perspective, just wondering as you think about what you guys are going to have to do in your re-submission do you have an understanding of when you'll be able to resubmit, what quarter or quarters of earnings you will be able to count from the original submission date and just how you are just kind of thinking of the process and how it might be different from the original submission?", "Harris H. Simmons ", "I think I could say that it's kind of start of the -- core stress period is January 1st. And so it captures everything that took place during the fourth quarter as well as I said earlier we expect some impact of all of the security sales that took place during the first quarter as well as the impact of the interim final rule on the Volcker rule that was republished in mid-January. So those are basically elements -- we're at work on preparing the resubmission and so we have the scenario and\u2026", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It does involve a new scenario provided by the fed as-well-as new ones -- this is Doyle -- created by us. And we will -- I think our submission will be in the next few weeks, possibly next week but the federal reserve then has under its rule 75 days to say we object or we do not object to what was proposed in the new plan. And so you may not get -- you and we may not find out exactly what we're going to do here until early in the third quarter. Could come -- if they speed up their process it could come, we might have an answer sometime in the latter part of the second quarter. ", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company LLC", "Okay, and then just given that we haven't had a public forum for you guys since that time, the $400 million -- that you mentioned in your press release that was part of your original submission, does that have any bearing or necessarily inclusion in what you end up resubmitting as far as potential capital actions that you might take to comply in your resubmission?", "Harris H. Simmons ", "I'd say it's a resubmission, so it's really a new submission with new capital actions et cetera. So we're still sorting through that. But it doesn't -- the 400 is not necessarily binding on us. It's not a starting point from which to start the new one. ", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company LLC", "Right. So I guess the question that lot of people are just asking is how do we start to understand the various mechanisms by which you might be thinking through in terms of either combo or some balance of factors to close that gap between 3%, 6% and 5%?", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Well. The -- if you take the original submission the 3%, 6% without the capital raise that's -- you can calculate how much that was, we had $400 million in the original and you can calculate the size of the whole. What we're not going to tell you is what we think the whole might be that we need to fill a [FINI] and the resubmission that's going to be between us and the fed until it's done. What we've told you is that one big contributing factor several hundred million so the whole would probably projected losses on the CDO portfolio and we believe that we have substantially eliminated that part of it by selling over $900 million of those securities that were calculated I believed by us to have the highest risk of stress losses in these scenarios. ", "But it's a new calculation, a new scenario, we will tell you the answer when we know the answer I guess and I know that's probably an unsatisfying, it's been unsatisfying to us but that's just the process. ", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company LLC", "Okay, understood. Thanks guys. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank. Dave, please go ahead.", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "Hey. Good afternoon guys. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Hello, Dave.", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "Sorry if you already mentioned this but I was just wondering have you guys considered filing for an extension for your resubmission, is that something that you can pursue?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "We can. I am just curious as to why you think we -- maybe you could tell us why we should?", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "Well I guess it would give you more time to do some risk reducing actions, that's the first thing that came to my mind. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well. At this point if we -- as Harris mentioned the starting point for the resubmission, both because we requested it after almost in conjunction with the original submission because of the expectation that the interim final rule would be published, might change everything but formally I think it was February we requested a resubmission. ", "We had even and we were, we are already engaged with the fed on that. Had we not have the shortfall on the DFAST test we would have been required to resubmit anyway. In both cases I believe the start date is the December 31 balance sheet. If we extend too far it's yet another resubmission with a new balance sheet date, nothing that we could do to de-risk today would count unless we rolled all the way forward to June 30th which I think might start to strain the federal reserve's patience and reasonably so. I mean it will be very hard to do something like that as under our understanding of the rules. ", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, got you, that's very helpful. And just switching gears back to the CRE line, it's a nice growth there. I was just wondering can update us on where the national real estate portfolio sits today, what the change was in that portfolio of this quarter and how much run-offs you are still expecting there? ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It did have run-offs. We're all kind of looking at ourselves, it's getting to be a smaller amount. We think it's around $2.8 billion and I believe the run-off was probably in the $100 million and $150 million range this quarter, lower into that range, closer to $100 million. ", "David Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great thanks guys appreciate it. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Murray from ISI. Keith, please go ahead. ", "Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc.", "Thank you. Could you just touch a minute on the net interest income give up from CDO sales, could you box that in for us? And does your guidance on NII include any additional or contemplate any additional CDO sales there? ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yeah, a lot of the CDOs that we sold because they were among the riskier once were non-performing and so we weren't accruing. So we only reported a total of about $2 million of interest income in the first quarter on the securities that were sold. So thus the impact should not be particularly material --", "Michael Morris", "It's about half a day's worth of interest. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That address your -- and what I don\u2019t know is if we sold some of -- some accruing securities before their accrual date but that you took that into account, yeah. So it's not material. ", "Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, thank you and then just going back to CCAR first again, is there anything that you've seen or understand your back and forth with the Fed that would make you revisit strategic decisions of how particular businesses are run or structured at this point in time? ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Well I think -- I'll tell you and I tried to allude to this in the opening remarks, we're probably puzzled frankly by the magnitude of the drop in pretax pre-provision net revenue. And we don\u2019t have any real transparency into how they arrived at that number. We don't -- it's a number that is astonishingly large, I think relevant to other -- certainly other regional banks ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It's small, the PPR\u2026", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Well the drop, the size of the decline is large the amount of the PPR is small, in other words and so I guess the answer to the question is no, it doesn't really lead us to any conclusions that are particularly useful. ", "Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc.", "Fair enough, thank you very much. ", "Operator", " Thank you. And our next question is from Marty Mosby from Guggenheim. Marty, please go head. ", "Marty Mosby III - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. On the provision side what you are saying is the total losses were very low, you don't see any real deterioration in the asset quality metrics but we are going from a release, significant release I think a meaningful release to very little this quarter just matching the total loss and going back up next quarter what was the thought process for the world this quarter and then the rebound that you are kind of highlighting going into the future quarters? ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "It\u2019s fairly arcane. We had as you -- we didn\u2019t really highlight it in the talking points but there was a slight uptick in classified loans although all the other metrics were stable to improving but there was a slight uptick in classified loans. There were couple of fairly large credits at Amegy and at [inaudible] California that had a downgrade and that classified status makes a big jump in the quantitative portion of the reserve calculation but for that we would have had reserve releases probably similar to what you have seen in the prior quarter. ", "We actually debated a lot about changing the qualitative factors to just not lean into the wind for all the reasons going to the qualitative factors as much but we decided to wait for one more kind of quarter's evidence and not do it just to offset the classified uptick. So it was a fairly and by the way and we don't think that the classified uptick is at all indicative of a trend so kind of just decided to wait another quarter and see how things develop but we are pretty confident that the general release trend will resume at that point.", "Marty Mosby III - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "", "Got you. And just kind of a real technical question on the fair value and non-hedged derivative loss, like you said TRS kind of flips that around. Was there anything in that $8.5 million this quarter that was related to closing out the swap? I mean is that higher because they are something that all of a sudden popped because that\u2019s about $3 million higher than usual. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes there was actually about $2 million true up of one of the three legs of the swap related to the original forecast moves in LIBOR versus what actually occurred. So yes the total TRS cost this first quarter was more like $7.4 million instead of the usual $5.2 million to $5.4 million and then as I mentioned that will go to about $0.5 million in the second quarter for the stub period and then zero thereafter.", "Marty Mosby III - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay that\u2019s all I wanted. Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question coming from John Pancari from Evercore. John, please go ahead.", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "", "Good afternoon.", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "To go back to the CCAR again, sorry do you necessarily need to wait until you hear back from the fed to raise capital if you decide to do so?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No we -- well yes actually we do. We need technically under the capital plan rule any distributions of capital or any capital actions which were any raise of capital must be approved by the fed. We do have approval from the fed to raise the capital that was in the first submission so I guess we could go ahead and do that amount or up to that amount if we chose to but I think our posture is probably to let this process play out a bit more and make sure we\u2019re on the right track with them.", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "", "Okay, all right. That makes sense. And then separately how do you think about how much of a buffer you think you will need over that 5%? So I know with your original expectation of that $400 million, you baked in a degree of a buffer over the minimum 5% so how you are thinking about it now in terms of meeting the minimum under the updated CCAR results?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Do you have our conference rooms bugged?", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I mean, that\u2019s the issue because I mean as Harris mentioned there is a very large difference between what our PPNR models would project and what federal reserve\u2019s model would project or did project in the original submission. We know a lot about how our models work. The fed publishes as you know very-very little about how its models work. So yeah I mean we in the absence of any other information we have to think very long and hard about -- basically assume the fed will get to a number somewhere in the second round if it does as it did it in the first and we will see it accordingly that is the dilemma here. ", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "All right, okay. And then I guess related lastly just on the CCAR still. I want to find out how are you thinking about the other actions as you're evaluating outside of a common equity raise and outside of CDO sales. I know you've thought about potentially selling or even securitizing commercial real-estate going forward. Can you talk about that a little bit how realistic of a possibility is that?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Well. We -- I mean as I mentioned we're already constrained in our loan growth by self-imposed concentration limits. So those limits are self-imposed in part because of the severity of losses that would be projected by us in particularly land development construction lending. But it appears that the federal reserve's projections are even far, far more severe. So we do have to manage that risk but yet we've got a lot of really good customers and a lot of really good people out originating -- capable of originating good quality business. ", "So we're looking at a variety of avenues, developing a more substantial and better organized syndications capability to originate and sell so we can continue to serve customers while laying off the risk or parts of it not, keeping all of it on our balance sheet. We're looking at the possibility of some originate flow origination partnerships with one or more parties and we're looking at ways to buy protection from people on some of the risk or stop loss coverage if you will. Nothing is eminent but it's clearly in a CCAR governing, stress test governing world it's something that we have to pursue very seriously and we're. ", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay. Thanks Doyle. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next come from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.", "Harris H. Simmons ", "", "Hi, Joe.", "Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. I was just curious about your thoughts on the DTA and to recapture some of that. I'd like, I guess given that your now selling more of the CDOs could the write- off be less from that as you also think about filling the hole and -- would be needed?", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes. I mean the answer is yes the DTA was reduced, I think by around $80 million by the security sales and I think it's in the ball park of that number. And that should that's DTA that won't reappear in our stress test, so yes. And in effect the securities sales kind of had an after tax impact on stress losses because of the DTA write off in the stress. I am kind of -- if you don't know what we're Joe and I are talking about. I realized I didn't say all that very clearly I am sorry. ", "Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets", "Well I apologize for taking you down that path but I was curious. I also was wondering if you had any color on kind of geographic trends in loan growth this quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Who's got geographic trends? James you got a fancy chart for that or Michael. ", "James R. Abbott", "We actually did. We've got -- Joe I have got -- and part of this is we've got some bank selling participation's from one bank to the other but when you see the call report data you will see that Zions Bank and also Commerce Bank, Washington with strengths on the C&I front. On commercial real estate the biggest strength came from California and also Texas was the strongest out of those two. Both of them experienced actually pretty good term commercial real estate growth but also it's California's good construction funding's as Michael Morris spoke to earlier. ", "Consumer book we did see a pretty good growth in most of the affiliate banks on the consumer side and that bodes pretty well for us. I would say while we are talking about it that on the consumer front we saw about a 25% reduction in origination volume on residential mortgage that was originated for sales. So it's a little bit softer quarter from that perspective that also fed in to the fee income line earlier but that gives you little bit of color around the footprint. ", "Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that's great. Thank you so much. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Sorry about my babbling on the DTA, Joe. ", "Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets", "I will follow up with James, thanks though.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take our next question from David Long from Raymond James. David, please go ahead. ", "David J. Long - Raymond James Financial Inc.", "Good afternoon, guys. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Hi, David. ", "David J. Long - Raymond James Financial Inc.", "So following up on the geographical question you talked about concentration limits and some types and some geographies can you expand on that and provide any more color? ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "I don't think we want to get into what property types we might be holding back in which markets. We don\u2019t want to put our guys to the competitive disadvantage. I think you will kind of agree with us on that one. ", "David J. Long - Raymond James Financial Inc.", "Okay. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "I would say that generally we still have some room but it's I mean there are pockets geographically in some product types. But I would suspect that's not different from what you find in lot of other banks candidly. ", "David J. Long - Raymond James Financial Inc.", "Okay, and then as the follow-up regarding the high cost debt that you still have outstanding, can you pre-pay that without issuing like capital, is there an opportunity to do that at this point or is that put on the back burner till we get more clarity, late second quarter, early third quarter on the CCAR results? ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "No, debt is debt, it's not capital. I mean in our sub debt it was once tier 2 capital effectively is not. We can't pre-pay it in the sense that we tendered last year for high cost senior debt, we retired a little over half of it that way we tendered in the fourth quarter for sub debt. We've got some of that brought in. But at this point the rest of it will just come as it matures. ", "There is just under $250 million of senior notes that cost us effectively 11.25%, that mature in September and we will pay those off with cash that we currently have on hand for back to the question how you're going to deploy the cash, that's a quarter of a billion of it. We have one issue of sub-debt that matures in May, it's less than $100 million. We'll pay that off with cash currently on hand.", "The effective cost on that debt because of the discount amortization, when we modified it, is north of 20%. So it's very -- it's not a lot of it left outstanding but it's quite expensive and then the last of the really expensive debt is two more issues of subordinated debt that mature in, I think it's third quarter, second and third quarter of next year, September of next year, again costing us north of 20% and there is I believe in total $250 million or so of that. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "We've also called four or five issues this quarter, that's about 130 million. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "First quarter? ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "The second quarter. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Okay. Does that address your question? ", "David J. Long - Raymond James Financial Inc.", "Yes. That's great thanks guys. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Okay, did we ever get back to Brad, who was -- okay let's keep going. John?", "Operator", " Okay, we'll take our next question from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson. ", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thank you, good evening. Most of my questions have been covered but I am curious what was the seasonal impact of expenses this quarter higher payroll et cetera? ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, about $7 million.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. Thanks so much. ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "You're welcome Jennifer. ", "Harris H. Simmons ", "Maybe we have time for one more question. ", "Operator", " Okay. So we'll take our next question from [Jeffrey Elliot]. Jeffrey, please go ahead. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hello there. On the CDO sales could you run through the total capital release that you've achieved so far and how much more potential there is just from reducing the Basel III risk weighted assets by selling down the CDOs? ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "The capital release really came in the form of stress capital release. The CDOs, well we sold some CDOs later in the quarter that were insurance only that were performing very-very well. In a perfect world we probably would have liked to held on to most of those but they were Volcker Rule prohibited even after the Interim Final Rule. But the stuff that we sold apart from that was going -- that which was projected to a result in the largest amount of OTTI in a severe stress environment that is other than temporary impairment which effects regulatory capital and I will remind you that the question what Joe Morford was asking about deferred tax asset because the losses were in total were severe enough in federal reserve severely adverse projections. ", "It appears they wrote off entirely or disallowed our DTA which meant that all of that OTTI dollar for dollar had an after tax impact on capital. If you go back to what the fed published in the DFAST results securities losses were little over $300 million and we would have and that\u2019s a direct hit to capital. We would expect that that would be -- by our calculation we reduced that to somewhere near zero by the securities that were sold. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "That helped?", "Unidentified Analyst", "That helped. So the balances\u2026", "Doyle L. Arnold", "I\u2019ll say since you asked about Basel III we have also -- we also had an impact to mostly other tier 1 and tier 2 capital from the corresponding deductions approach because of this rather large portfolio and again essentially that\u2019s a dollar we have eliminated not all but a lot of that deductions from other tier 1 and tier 2 capital in the Basel III calculation by selling down the portfolio and [by the way] maybe that\u2019s what you are getting at when you ask the Basel III question. I am not sure.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay so the impact is on the numerator with a pretty small impact on the denominator then? ", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Yes, well, on tier 1 comment it\u2019s a big impact on the numerator and it\u2019s not that big impact on the denominator but in the Basel III calculation it\u2019s an even bigger impact on the numerator in the non-common tier 1 because of the corresponding deductions approach. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Great, thanks very much.", "Doyle L. Arnold", "Okay.", "Harris H. Simmons ", "I think that\u2019s it, John. At this point we\u2019ve reached the end of our hour and so we thank everyone for their time on the call today and if you have any further questions please feel free to follow up James Abbott and I will be happy to get in touch with you.

This call is being recorded. I will now turn the time over to James Abbott. Please go ahead.", "James Abbott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and External Communications", "Thank you. And we welcome you to this conference call to discuss our second quarter of 2014 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During that section, we ask you to limit your question to one primary and one follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. Harris?", "Harris Simmons - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, James and we welcome you to the call today. We continue to make substantial progress on a variety of fronts, including credit quality, certain elements of fee income, generally stable net interest margin and net interest income. We are also making solid progress on efforts that are taking place behind the scenes, including the ongoing and significant upgrade to our risk and credit management practices, which is a process that has been going on for sometime now since it\u2019s a crisis and an area where great progress has been made, but there is always more to do.", "A key challenge for Zions is holding the expense level at or near current levels at a time when the current interest rate environment has placed the pressure on net interest margins across the industry. And when the systems need to be replaced and we continue to need to invest to meet increasing compliance, stress testing and other regulatory requirements. Although all banks face the spread compression challenge, Zions is somewhat more sensitive to his pressure than some of the nation\u2019s largest banks, because spread income is a larger portion of our total income statement or total revenue.", "Turning to the financial results for the quarter. Net interest income, excluding the income from FDIC indemnified loans, increased about $7 million or about 2%. As we have guided in the past, loan growth and reduced debt expense acted as offsets to natural pressures from loan pricing pressure and the declining source of earnings from loans purchased from the FDIC back in 2009 are so-called covered loans. With regard to loan yield pressure, the primary challenge has been new loans coming on at yields that are below those of loans that are rolling off. The competitive pricing environment has been difficult for all banks, although in many of our markets and lending types, we are experiencing some stability in marginal pricing.", "Regarding volume, we experienced healthy average and period end loan growth in the second quarter and origination volume increased slightly over the same period a year ago, up about 2%. Our managers and those involved in our small business lending are seeing improved demand and higher approval rates in their \u2013 in this particular area of small business. And middle-market commercial and industrial and consumer demand remains reasonably healthy. Commercial real estate lending demand in our markets is reasonably strong. Although as we have discussed in this forum in the past, we are limiting our growth in commercial real estate as part of our concentration risk management practices as well as the very high capital requirements, when you consider the capital required to support such loans for those of us that are subject to Dodd-Frank Act stress tests.", "We are hearing from our lenders that some of the other large bank competitors in our markets are backing away from the loan type that receives the most significant losses in the stress test, in this case, the construction and land development category. So, we probably are not alone in this redirection of capital allocation. Although Zions construction and development loan balances grew in the second quarter, commitments declined. Our loan growth outlook remains unchanged on the whole and that is for slightly to moderately increasing loan volumes.", "Credit quality is strong and the trends are generally stable to improving. Our loan net charge-off ratio remains one of the best in the industry at 6 basis points and total loans on an annualized basis. Non-performing assets improved by about 14% from the prior quarter and equaled 95 basis points of loans and REO the first time it\u2019s fallen below 1% since 2007. Classified loans declined about 5% in the quarter.", "With respect to capital, our GAAP common equity capital ratios increased compared to the prior quarter with a tangible common equity ratio rising to 8.6% from 8.2% last quarter, primarily due to the cancellation of our total return swap on our collateralized debt obligation portfolio. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel I declined about 14 basis points to 10.42%, which is in line with information I previously communicated to you. Finally, let me note that I suspect that many of you are anxious to know more about the Federal Reserve review of Zion\u2019s stress test and capital plan resubmission. As indicated in our 8-K filed on July 14, we currently expect Federal Reserve to provide a response to our resubmitted capital plan by July 28.", "With that overview, I will now ask Doyle to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle?", "Doyle Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Harris. Good afternoon everyone. A brief overview for the second quarter 2014, Zion\u2019s posted net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $104.5 million or $0.56 per diluted common share. This compares to net earnings applicable to common of $76.2 million in the prior quarter or $0.41 per diluted common share. There were kind of two big swing items between the quarters. First, recall that first quarter results included a net $31 million pretax gain on fixed income securities that resulted from CDO sales that we did that quarter. That added about $0.10 per share to earnings in that quarter and a higher preferred dividend level that quarter reduced earnings by about $0.05 a share.", "The other big swing is in the second quarter due to continued strong improvements in credit quality that was referenced by Harris earlier we had a net negative provision for the combined \u2013 combination of funded and unfunded lending commitments of approximately $448 million negative. There is one other much smaller item that some of you will want to be aware of. We have a one-time or specific tax accrual of about $2.3 million or $0.01 a share this quarter related to some older tax years which we do not expect to be included in the tax line going forward.", "Now, I will move on to a brief review of some of the key revenue drivers. Average loans held for investment increased $419 million compared to the prior quarter. Period end loans held for investment increased a similar amount $432 million. The primary increases were driven then by commercial and industrial loans of $293 million and consumer loans primarily residential mortgages of $103 million.", "We are experiencing loan growth in July and expected to continue based on reports from various lending groups. But as kind of indicated in Harris\u2019 opening remarks, we are constraining loan growth in some cases by self imposed risk concentration limits particularly on some types of commercial real estate loans. If we did not have these risk management limits, but we do, loan growth rates would be stronger as there is demand out there. In part because of the concentration limits we were able to be more selective on the deals that we do accept and it enables us to be somewhat slower to cut pricing or to loosen underwriting standards when we encounter that kind of market price pressure.", "I also mentioned here that the increase in construction land development loans in the second quarter were solely attributable to draws on existing lines. By design, we slightly reduced C&D commitments in the second quarter and trying to continue to at least in the near-term constrain C&D commitment growth given the very significant equity requirement on such loans in the CCAR stress test process. We are encouraged by recent reports that the outlook for capital expenditure for both large and small businesses appears to be on the rise. The managers of our small business lending units are notably more optimistic about loan growth in that space. And in some markets such borrowers are becoming more active. Managers of larger C&I credits report that customer optimism is about the same as it was a few months ago. And then in that area, our pipelines are generally stable with levels back in March. Managers of commercial real estate products are reporting the market remains quite robust, although there is generally less demand for new multi-family construction than in the past.", "Turning to new production volume, that increased approximately 2% from a year ago. We are encouraged that pricing on new loan production has remained essentially stable for the last four quarters. The yield on the loan portfolio, excluding the FDIC supported loans, declined only 2 basis points in the second quarter to 4.28% from 4.30% in the prior quarter. The coupon on new production does remain below the weighted average coupon rate of the existing portfolio however. Therefore, we do expect additional compression for the next several quarters. Although as the portfolio yield converges with the production yield, the rate of compression should moderate. Line utilization rates on revolving C&I loans were up slightly to about 33% from 32% in the prior quarter. Small C&I loans defined as commitments less than $5 million accounted for the increase, where the utilization rate of 40% this quarter, up from 39% in the prior quarter.", "Let me discuss for a moment the FDIC supported loans and the income from that source as I have done in the past. We continue to experience quite strong performance on the loans in this portfolio. Payoff amounts and recoveries are in excess of estimates used in previous cash flow analyses, which are updated quarterly. Such pay-off and recovery activity results in accelerated income and enhanced yield of FDIC supported and other purchase credit impaired loans. Such loans yield at an annualized 23% for the second quarter, which was very strong, but albeit down from 29% in the first quarter or about $16 million of total interest income. That\u2019s about 3% of total interest income, yet the loans represent just 0.5% of total interest earning assets.", "At the beginning of this year, we expected the total remaining income from the portfolio to be roughly $80 million. The substantial majority of which would be recognized by the end of next year that is 2015. The updated number now is approximately $100 million, of which about $39 million has been recognized in the first half of the year. Current expectation is for roughly $15 million for the remainder of 2014 between $15 million and $20 million in 2015 with the remaining accretion expected to occur in years after that. However, these estimates are subject to revisions that may continue to be significant depending upon basically the underlying strength of the market for the disposition of loans and recoveries on loans in that portfolio.", "The indemnification asset expense related to this loan book, which is recognized as a component of other non-interest expense equaled $9 million for the quarter, down from $16 million in the prior quarter and should amount to a total of about $6 million in the third quarter. And going into periods beyond the third quarter, if FDIC supported loan cash flows exceed our current forecast, we will recognize additional both revenue in the form of interest income and the related expense in the other non-interest expense line, the revenue will exceed the expense, however, kind of no matter what, just the amounts of both may vary. For example, if we experienced $10 million of cash flow in excess of our current forecast over several quarters, we would recognize $10 million of interest income over that timeframe and about $8 million of non-interest expense over the same timeframe which is the FDIC\u2019s portion of the cash flow. I wish we didn\u2019t talk so long about that item but I know it\u2019s a source of noise that some of you try to back out of your estimates.", "So we will move \u2013 now move on to the overall margin and net interest income. Turning to the net interest margin on Page 13 of the release you will note that the NIM declined two basis points compared to the prior quarter. Looking at the primary drivers reduced income from the just discussed FDIC supported loans reduced the NIM by about six basis points and lower income from available-for-sale securities reduced it by about three. But offsetting this, a lower balance in cost of long-term debt enhanced demand by about three basis points. And the change in the mix of the asset base higher balance of loans and a reduced the balance of cash provided about four basis points of NIM support.", "As previously mentioned the yield on loans declined two basis points to 4.28% from 4.30% in the prior quarter. Yield on commercial loans was very stable compared to prior quarter 4.3% versus 4.29% last quarter, as of the consumer portfolio 4.07% versus 4.09%. The loan type showing the most significant compression was the construction and land development portfolio which declined to 4.33% from 4.63% or 30 basis points. And the yields on those types of loans are fairly similar to those in the C&I portfolio at this point.", "On Page 9, total net interest income was $416 million, which was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and I think in line with the guidance that we have been giving you throughout the quarter. Although we ceased building a core net interest or providing a core net interest income we have committed to giving you components so that you could continue to calculate it if you wish to do so. And we will do so for the remainder of this year. The additional accretion on FDIC supported loans is found on the table, bottom of Page 9. It equaled about $11.7 million. The discount amortization on subordinated debt was $6.5 million. Adjusting for these factors there was about $5 million linked quarter increase in net interest income. The net interest margin if one adjusted for these factors actually increased slightly.", "Turning now to non-interest income on Page 7, after we and many other banks experienced a very soft first quarter in fee income ours and some others bounced back a bit here in the second quarter, other service charges, commissions and fees in particular increased to $47.5 million, up from $43.5 million in the prior quarter and compared to year ago period is up about 3.5%. Much of the increase is due to our efforts to improve penetration of business credit cards. The fair value and non-hedged derivative income line increased by about $6 million to a negative $1.9 million from the prior quarter, this was primarily the result of the cancellation of the total return swap in late April which we advised you of both before and at that time. We do not expect any further contra revenues from that item in the future quarters.", "Regarding fixed income security gain \u2013 securities gains, although we did not sell any CDOs in the second quarter, we recognized a gain of $5 million. This occurs when we have taken other than temporary and common charges in the past or if we purchased securities at a discount par in the past which we did when we bought those \u2013 some securities out of Lockhart Funding, our off-balance sheet QSPE back in the period 2007 to 2009. Anyway if those securities now payoff at par, they are paying off at a price that\u2019s higher than the market value. And this quarter, we received par value pay-downs of $24 million as seen on Page 8 of the release resulting in a gain of $5 million. We currently expect this to be an ongoing source of income although it maybe a bit sporadic in nature. Assuming the economy remains relatively stable our models indicate that we should receive almost all of the par value of the performing CDOs if we held them to maturity or about $60 million of gains.", "Our models also indicate that we should end up recognizing values greater than amortized cost on non-performing CDOs, but it\u2019s substantially less than the par value of those CDOs. And the realization of that income would likely take many \u2013 being many years in the future assuming we continue to hold them for that long. Although we may hold these securities to realize some of the gains I just described, we may also elect to sell some of them from time-to-time in order to maximize our capital ratios under the stress testing process, a well-defined benefit today in exchange for a less certain benefit sometime in the future.", "Finally, non-interest expense turning back to Page 7 most of the line items were fairly flat compared to the prior quarter, with three exceptions. Salaries and benefits increased by $5.4 million. Seasonal expense declines for payroll taxes were offset by an expense that occur seasonally every second quarter, which relates to stock grants to certain employees. Those, in fact, just so you understand the stock grants for employees who are eligible for retirement and would best continue to vest into retirement are expensed immediately, because effectively, the employee could elect to retire and have those grants fully vest over time. So, that\u2019s a pop that occurs when we make those annual grants in the second quarter.", "Base salaries increased in part due to normal cost of living increases, but also as a result of increased staffing related to risk management compliance and the various systems replacement and enhancement projects that we announced a year ago. We have indicated that we are attempting to keep overall non-interest expense levels flat during this process. We expected salary levels in some professional services to increase to reflect this offset by declines in the indemnification asset expense and other credit-related costs. We are still staffing up for some of those projects and expenditures should increase somewhat over the next six quarters and then begin to decline in 2016.", "Finally, I have already addressed the indemnification asset expense, which is contained in the other lines. If you strip out the indemnification expense, other non-interest expense increased only slightly compared to the prior quarter.", "Let me wrap up now with summary of our outlook and guidance for the next year forward or so. Loan growth will remain \u2013 maintaining our slight to moderate growth outlook for loans over the one year horizon, although loans have continued to grow thus far in July, we don\u2019t expect third quarter growth to be quite as strong as the second quarter as we see it unfolding currently.", "Net interest income on a GAAP basis, including the effect of the expected decline in interest income from the FDIC supported loans we expect to remain relatively stable. Pressure should come from further declines in those FDIC supported loan net interest income and as loans maturing that are replaced with loans at lower yield. As we get further out into 2014 and early \u201815, we expect that loan growth and higher cost, senior and subordinated debt payoffs will offset much of that pressure. Excluding the FDIC supported loan income we expect net interest income to increase slightly over the next year.", "Non-interest income, we expect the less volatile components such as service fees to continue a modest upward trend as we push further into the mortgage space and enhance our treasury management product penetration. I mean for non-interest expense we \u2013 as I have mentioned we are attempting the hold non-interest expenses relatively stable at around $1.6 billion annually. We continue to hire for systems initiatives and regulatory and compliance-related jobs and expect our full-time equivalent employee base to increase by approximately 1% to 2% over the next year. Some of that \u2013 some of the expenses of those employees will be capitalized and somewhat offsetting the expense increases should be continued reduction in credit related expense and FDIC indemnification asset expense amortization.", "During the provision expense, given our expectation of continued improvement in metrics that drive our ALLL methodology, we expect the provision expense to remain negative in the near-term. The current debt equity, I will just note that for those who are trying to figure out what to do with that line item, the first quarter\u2019s reserve release was probably a bit usually on the low side, while the second quarter\u2019s release was probably a bit on the high side if you are trying to \u2013 it probably somewhere in their brackets the target if you are trying to build a model. But I don\u2019t have any particular number in mind, I hasten \u2013 I must hasten to add that just trying to point the way things look. The tax rate as I mentioned was slightly elevated in the second quarter from that one item and we expected we will run a bit closer to 36% for the balance of the year. And finally deferred dividends should run around $15 million to $17 million per quarter.", "With that I think we will wrap up the opening soliloquies and operator would you open up the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi Brad.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "Doyle, just want to ask about the balance sheet, some of the \u2013 you talked a lot about the reduction in cash, but looking at the deposit base, foreign deposits came down quite a bit in link quarter, can you talk a little bit about that and some of the movement you might see in the liquidity as you look out over the back half of the year, what your plans might be there, how they may have changed?", "Doyle Arnold", "We debated about whether to talk about deposits in the opening remarks and wait or wait for the question and the question is number one. So there were two \u2013 there were kind of two unusual items in deposits. One, is we closed a Cayman Islands branch which reduced the foreign deposits, but they were all re-booked domestically. So if you look at I believe it was mostly went into savings and now accounts, was it David. Savings and money market accounts, so that line item increased slightly, so that was just a shift. We did the next reduction in deposits of I think it was between $800 million to $900 million was driven primarily by the departure of one large institutional customer that we had \u2013 it was a college savings plan customer that we effectively no bid the renewal because it was costing more than deposits were worth. So and there was no other real relationship with that party. So it was a result of decision that we actually had plenty of liquidity and so we exited. That was our choice to exit that account. I will give you a chance to follow-on on that one if that was clear.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "No thanks. Maybe just to follow-up just in terms of liquidity, the $7.5 billion of money market on average I guess was down to a little more than $6 billion on a period end basis, any change in how you are going to manage that going forward?", "Harris Simmons", "No, I mean we are beginning to track against some of the new liquidity metrics that will become binding I think in January, particularly liquidity coverage ratio, we don\u2019t \u2013 the final rules are not yet published as you know, but as best we can calculate, we think we are in pretty good shape on that metric, but there is a lot less than $7.5 billion of true excess liquidity that we will have to hold a number of billions of dollars of liquidity in the form of cash or very low risk, very liquid assets like treasuries, for example, going forward anyway. So, I think the best outlook is that loan growth will continue to erode into that cash amount at an incremental rate, but there are no plans given the flatness and lowness of the yield curve to move a lot of that cash out. David, would you \u2013 anything you would like to add on that?", "David Hemingway", "No, I would agree with that.", "Harris Simmons", "Okay.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay, great. Thank you, guys.", "Harris Simmons", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Harris Simmons", "Hello, Steve.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Regarding the stress test, Harris in your prepared comments you indicated larger banks directing capital away from C&D loans, based on what you guys are seeing from this stress test is now resubmissioned, is there anything you had flagged for us as a change in the way you guys plan to run the business?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, I just \u2013 I mean I just underscore what both Doyle and I, I think said that is that one of the things we are certainly focused on is the capital consumed by construction and development. And so we are actively trying to manage down exposures there. Ultimately, it\u2019s a business that will always be in here in the west. It\u2019s an important line of business to us. And we may find other ways to conduct some of this business through and originate and sell kind of the model, but that in particular is a near-term focus. We are interested to see the results \u2013 our own results and those of the Federal Reserve in the 2015 CCAR exercise, that will probably provide some additional color to us in terms of how we are going to think about this, but we do understand that commercial real estate generally is consuming more capital than some of the other loan types in the context of stress tests. And so we are trying to think about that accordingly as we establish concentration limits.", "Doyle Arnold", "I just add if you go back to the Federal Reserve\u2019s published CCAR results for all the banks, the stress losses on commercial real estate loans were pretty high compared to other types. And while the Fed does not provide a breakdown between construction and development and term and owner-occupied, we and investment banks and consultants have all tried to estimate what that breakdown might be. And it looks like that construction and development are maybe doubled or more, the loss rates that the Fed published is for overall CRE, which makes it pretty painful from a capital utilization standpoint relative to as I mentioned pricing that has actually come down over time. And so that\u2019s what we are dealing with.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Maybe to follow up what\u2019s your annual spend running now tied to compliance-related cost as a CCAR bank and are you at a stage now where it sounds like you are still building on that, we shouldn\u2019t be thinking of any room for efficiencies here at least over the near-term?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 this is Harris, but it\u2019s the slope of the line is leveling I think. I mean, it\u2019s not \u2013 we are not adding at the pace that we were two, three years ago, but it\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s actually something that I would be reluctant to try to nail down an actual cost. We have added, I mean the last time I tried to track this, we have added something over 300 full-time equivalent staff. This sort of this goes back about a year ago and that was over the prior couple of years, that numbers continued to grow, but not at the same pace. So if you read some of speeches by Federal Reserve governors particularly Governor Tarullo, lately he indicates publicly what we are experiencing directly which is the Fed\u2019s level of expectation, it does continue to grow \u2013 increase. And it would appear you have got another maybe another couple of years of continued heightened expectations. Well, not having to add as much staff to meet those expectations, just redeploy them into addressing the current year\u2019s level of top concerns is they are expressing to us in the industry. I don\u2019t know if that makes \u2013 if you follow that but that\u2019s we are all \u2013 they describe it as a glide path upward to a spot they want us all to get to.", "Doyle Arnold", "I would just \u2013 I would only say I mean heightened expectations I think is always going to be with us, that\u2019s just a new environment that I think all banks sort of find themselves in. I think in a couple of years that (Joel) is talking about is probably a couple of more years of some building spend. We also as we have talked about some of these big systems projects, we are becoming more encouraged as we get those in place that we will be able to see some savings and so we see some silver linings on the horizon.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks for all the color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Hello. Good afternoon.", "Doyle Arnold", "Hi Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "I guess I was just curious if you could give us any color on regional trends in loan growth this quarter?", "Doyle Arnold", "You want to talk about that James.", "James Abbott", "Yes. Joe this is James here. I would say we saw really the strongest growth came from the Amegy and the Utah banks. Utah had a very strong C&I growth in the quarter. On the small business front in Utah there was a lot of optimism today. Just really a good overall market I believe the unemployment rate in Utah is 3.6.", "Doyle Arnold", "3.5.", "James Abbott", "3.5 that is going, and so it\u2019s been very strong on those fronts. We saw a very good consumer loan growth across most of the franchise. So it really is pretty a broad based growth. And so I would just say that a couple of the areas that we did experience some attrition is on obviously on term commercial real estate. Some of that was in actually was across some of the several places in the footprint we did experience growth in construction and land development across about four or five of the affiliate banks. And but again the commitments have come down in virtually all of the affiliate banks compared to prior quarter.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I guess the other question is just a couple of things on expenses, I have recognized some of the finance bounce around, but provisions around funding commitments was up from last quarter to a slight recovery though the overall level of commitment seem like it was stable, so wondered what was going on there maybe something unusual last quarter. And then similarly with the elevated provision on legal services now that we are through the resubmissions, do you think we will start to see that level start to tail down a little bit?", "Doyle Arnold", "I would think in order provisions for unfunded lending commitments, is it gets moved around by a number of things. There were actually some very late quarter increases right at the end of the quarter increases in commitments last quarter that weren\u2019t picked up in our methodology. They were not deemed material but that added \u2013 basically it did add to the provision for unfunded commitments this quarter. We had a little bit of deterioration in one credit quality metric in a couple of loans, but there is no \u2013 I think the best thing I could tell you there is that overall in this environment, the growth \u2013 the provision for unfunded commitments ought to be somewhere around zero to a very small positive number with the driver being growth in new commitments or unfunded commitments driving the number to be positive and continued improvements, general improvements and credit quality pushing it back down towards zero.", "On consulting and legal and whatnot, yes, the resubmission is in, but we like all bank sales, as I mentioned, a number of to do items from \u2013 as a result of the last CCAR \u2013 the Federal Reserve expects further qualitative improvements out of all banks and so we are spending to address those further improvements in our stress testing processes. I do think the rate of spend on that will be less this year than last and it should be less next year than this year.", "Harris Simmons", "And I\u2019d just note that, I mean, this quarter last year was $70.1 million, that\u2019s actually down $5 million from where it was in this quarter last year and that does reflect the fact that we\u2019re spending less on CCAR related pretty much, but it\u2019s going to be there probably for a while as we continue to refine that process.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.", "Harris Simmons", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, guys.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, Ken.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "I guess first question is just in terms of the small business demand, it seems like you guys have mentioned that small business demand has picked up or is picking up for last several quarters. How much of the loan growth this quarter actually came from what you defined as small businesses versus the larger businesses? And also when you are looking into what you are seeing in July sort of same question, what is being driven by small versus larger clients?", "James Abbott", "What we saw, we saw \u2013 Ken, this is James, we saw a pickup in the line utilization rate as mentioned in the press release and it\u2019s although it\u2019s small, it was a pickup, the commitment rate for large business has actually declined. Our syndicated credit balances declined on a linked quarter basis and so \u2013 and then in terms of overall production volume, it was up for small business. In terms of balances, I will have to get back to you after the call. I have got a sheet that\u2019s not with me here, but basically the smallest in the $1 million to $5 million size credits with the ones that definitely experienced some of the bigger increases in volume on the production side. And the optimization is definitely \u2013 is definitely there, it\u2019s \u2013 the approval rates on small business credit for example is probably up 10 to 15 percentage points compared to couple of years ago. And we are now in the 75%, 80% approval rates of those that are applying, so that\u2019s a meaningful increase over the past couple of years.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "And what that basically result from is their balance sheets and the income statements have kind of completed the heeling process from the deep recession and there is now built up two or three years of better financial performance that can be years to justify or lending?", "Harris Simmons", "I don\u2019t suggest, just a little footnote that is we were just named this last week as the recognized as largest SBA lender in the Houston, MSA which is a first for us after working at that for several years and for any of our people listening in it, they kudos for that, but I \u2013 that puts us kind of in a lending position in SBA production in Houston and in the state of Utah and up to Idaho, couple of the very best economies in the United States where we are really doing it, I think a really good job with SBA production and that\u2019s kind of a bellwether for all kinds of other small business loans that we are doing in these markets.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Got it, okay. And then a follow-up question just in terms of the potential equity raise after you hear back from the Fed, are you guys in a position that we could actually execute on the equity raise as soon as you hear back or just hoping to get an update on the timing of when that is likely to happen if you had also any thoughts on the form that, that might happen in terms of either dribble out or something else? Thanks.", "Doyle Arnold", "Yes. I think we are going to \u2013 we are just going to defer any discussion of the equity raise until there is one. If there is one and that won\u2019t \u2013 we won\u2019t be in a position to discuss that until after we have heard back from the Fed. We all want to avoid tripping over securities law issues about hiking a deal or anything like. So, let us talk that one please.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Fair enough. Alright, thank you much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.", "Doyle Arnold", "Hi, Jennifer.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson", "Hi. Actually, Joe just took my question a second ago, I tried to queue out, but could you guys talk about \u2013 I think you have talked in the last few quarters you have talked about kind of bumping up against your concentration limits in certain categories, notably energy. Can you talk about where you are in that process right now?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, we have \u2013 under the limits we have in place, we still have some room. So, we are not \u2013 we are not ducking under the ceiling yet, but\u2026.", "Doyle Arnold", "We were phasing out the growth so that we can manage effectively concentrations and serve good customers.", "Harris Simmons", "Yes.", "Doyle Arnold", "Scott McLean sits here with us. So, we will let him.", "Scott McLean", "Sure. Jennifer, this is Scott. And the concentration limits really are not constraining at the moment. There is a lot \u2013 as you know, there is a lot of churn in the oilfield service business and in the reserve base business, in terms of private equity firms selling and repositioning their businesses. And so there is a lot of opportunity to be very active in both reserve base, midstream and oilfield service, while total outstanding, total commitments, they stay relatively constant. There is a lot of opportunity to generate additional income.", "Harris Simmons", "Yes. I think what I would say is that, I mean limits are, they are causing us to probably think twice about the kinds of \u2013 we are not just growing willy-nilly, but there is still room for kind of prudent growth there, but it\u2019s something we watch.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson", "Thank you very much.", "Doyle Arnold", "Okay, Jennifer.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.", "John Pancari - Evercore", "Good afternoon guys.", "Harris Simmons", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore", "On the CCAR front, just a couple of very quick questions there. Just want to see if you have any color on the Fed\u2019s extension request, which I am assuming you may not, but I figured I would ask? And then also on the PPNR differential between where you are expecting and then where you came out, wanted to see if you have got any additional color from the Fed on that front? And that\u2019s my main two things around the CCAR.", "Doyle Arnold", "Yes. I wish I could provide you color, but I think you heard from us consistently and others, that anything communications related to the whole stress testing in CCAR process, the Federal Reserve considers to be part of their supervisory process and supervisory communication and information sharing is confidential. So, I simply cannot provide you with any color. When we know something more definitive, we will \u2013 it would be material and we will have to say something publicly at that time. But in terms of sharing information about the process of getting to that definitive answer, I simply can\u2019t.", "John Pancari - Evercore", "Alright, that\u2019s fair. But I guess in the \u2013 you have mentioned your efforts to control your concentration risk, particularly as you are looking at commercial real estate and as you are doing that, I know you have talked about some considerations, including potential securitizations, potential CDS against your CRE underwriting. Can you talk to us what developments have you completed on that front? How far along the path are you in terms of developing your own securitization capability, how real is that opportunity?", "Doyle Arnold", "We continue to explore a number of options and there are some that are probably take longer to bring to fruition than other securitization probably falls into the \u2013 that\u2019s going to take us a little longer, I mean, may be year or two to really build up the capability and also the pipeline of loans that have all of the standard characteristics that the CMBS type market is looking for. We continue to work on those, but we are also looking at nearer term ways to manage particular concentration risk sold down some of our commitments or portfolio by offsetting portfolios of other types from other players, etcetera. So, you may see more of that kind of activity in the near-term, but overtime I think we remained convinced of what we have here is a strategically as a very high quality commercial real-estate origination capability both for term loans and for construction development loans and we want to not only maintain, but actually grow that capability overtime in a very good market, but it\u2019s going to require developing on those capabilities more robustly to \u2013 cannot keep all of that risk on our balance sheet under a stress testing environment so, is that kind of address your question?", "John Pancari - Evercore", "Yes, it did. If I can access one more quick thing around expenses, Harris, I know you mentioned that you\u2019re still struggling with the expenses here or remained challenges you put it and in terms of your efficiency ratio given your flattish expense expectations, it is fair to assume that the efficiency ratio was relatively stable here at this 74%, 75% level or can we see a come down a lit here in the next couple of quarters?", "Harris Simmons", "I mean some of the moving parts, the provision lending commitments, you have to take that out, I think that we fair about thinking about the ratio. Beyond that, we\u2019re working hard at some particular elements of non-interest income which we know we need to get to a little higher place we \u2013 our fee income mix looks like more like that of probably typical $15 billion bank or doesn\u2019t some of our larger peers. And some of those things take a little time to address, but we\u2019re working really hard on several aspects of that that we think over to the next few years will really help. The big driver is going to be just restoration of more traditional net interest margin levels as interest rates rise. That makes \u2013 that\u2019s going to make the big difference is getting back into a little more normal interest rate environment that will really change the number and we are continuing to work at cost control.", "And I in the last couple of weeks have been in discussions about probably up to roughly 10 to 12 locations that I would expect that we will probably be closing in coming months or consolidating into other nearby branches etcetera. So, I mean, we are working on that front and doing what we can, but it\u2019s really a numerator, denominator problem rather on the revenue side more than it is, I think on the expense side in terms of what we can address. And we have got and we have some of these systems projects that are going to put some pressure on it for probably the next few quarters, especially until we can start to see some of the cost savings that come along with these projects.", "John Pancari - Evercore", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Doyle, I was wondering if you can give us an update on how you are thinking about those higher pieces of higher cost debt, we have got the one coming due this year and then a couple of pieces next year and so can you layout for us whether at this point you just intend to just let those mature and whether or not just normal maturity would cause you to have to also reissue to keep kind of flat on a funding cost basis?", "Doyle Arnold", "No. Our current expectation, Ken, is that we will pay-off that debt, the senior debt in September and the additional two tranches of sub-debt in the latter half of next year as they mature. And that the total amount of unsecured debt issued by the parent would come down over that time period, but probably we may issue small amounts of senior debt during that process, but the net amount of debt should come down. We are basically going to pay it off.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay.", "Doyle Arnold", "No more tenders are expected and we don\u2019t think though it would be very particularly productive.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay, that makes sense. And then secondly, just from a balance sheet asset side efficiency perspective to your earlier points about the need for keeping excess liquidity and then the uncertainties about deposit outflows. Can you talk about where you stand in terms of just waiting for loan growth versus reinvesting in the securities portfolio in terms of waiting for those final rules and maintaining an adequate buffer on the liquidity side?", "Doyle Arnold", "I don\u2019t think we have changed our stance really from what we have been saying for a number of quarters now. There are no plans to buy significant amounts of longer dated securities, particularly mortgage-backed securities. I am not saying we won\u2019t do any, but the plan is to incrementally grow loans. And we think that the deposit \u2013 at the same time, deposit growth will \u2013 which has already slowed down and flattened will likely continue to do so. And we have anecdotally heard of and seen instances of customers beginning to draw deposits down to redeploy cash internally within their businesses. So, we are not planning to go out and invest a lot of that cash.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay, right. So, you guys just getting up the sort of the governance of slowing the loan growth in pockets does not necessarily make you think about that any differently?", "Doyle Arnold", "No, because we still expect net loan growth. I think at this point we are probably going to allow one question each we want to get, but defer the follow-ups to James to handle after the call just so we can get \u2013 we got about five more people I think queued up. So, we will try to do bam bam bam.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Lightning around.", "Doyle Arnold", "Lightning around, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Doyle Arnold", "Hi, Dave.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "Hey, good afternoon guys. Just a follow-up on the cash position, I was just wondering how much excess cash you think you have at this point over which you might need for the LCR and how long do you think it\u2019s going to take for loan growth to use up that excess assuming that your assumptions play out there?", "David Hemingway", "This is David Hemingway. First is there has been suggested we do not have final rules for the LCR. So, what I have to say is totally based upon our assumptions as to what the final rules might be, but we could have excess cash in the range I would think in the $2 billion to $3 billion range. And so you can actually do the math just how many quarters it would take to chew that up without any loan shrinkage. The big uncertainty is this if and when or when higher interest rates come is the $19 billion of non-interest bearing demand going to stay or are the depositors going to act rationally and pull some of that money out. And those are the issues that we deal with in asset and liability management and liquidity management, so\u2026.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "For how much of it converts into interest bearing?", "David Hemingway", "Well, how much of it converts into interest bearing and if we need the money we can probably keep it, but if we don\u2019t need the money, it will probably go.", "Doyle Arnold", "Yes. There is no circumstance under which I would see deposit funding as constraining loan growth, because you can always go out and buy it. Okay. We will move on to the next question.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "Hello, there. So, my question is on the deposit base, particularly the $19 billion of non-interest bearing, what is your latest thinking on how those deposits behave as rates increase, but the interest bearing and the non-interest bearing and then how do you think the mechanism of that tightening in bank\u2019s deposits behavior, whether it\u2019s raising reverse repo rate, raising interest of excess reserves doing something else?", "Doyle Arnold", "I would, Jeffrey, I\u2019d refer you to the investor presentations that we have given in the second quarter. There are a couple of them out there, one of which at least was filed as an 8-K where we lay out pretty explicitly our thinking and the assumptions that underlie our IRR modeling, but basically if you want to refer to somebody else\u2019s and tune with our thinking, I will refer you to the CFO of JPMorgan Chase, who laid out pretty explicitly what she thinks is going to happen, but I think kind of we are directionally in the same place she is, which is that the Fed will drain a lot of liquidity out of the system and that rates may rise. When rates rise, they may rise faster than people are expecting and a lot of this, I don\u2019t know, we have laid out some modeling assumptions about how much of our non-interest bearing DDA would have \u2013 would flow out and be replaced by interest bearing funds, but it\u2019s \u2013 and I think we are being more conservative on that front than a lot of peers and more explicit in publishing what we are modeling. So, I just refer you to that.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "And to the mechanism?", "Doyle Arnold", "As to the specific mechanisms the Fed might use and how much reliance on repos and other tools, I am not \u2013 that\u2019s for them to decide not for me to convince.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Hey, good afternoon guys.", "Harris Simmons", "Hello, Brian.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "I guess, you mentioned earlier about the small business lending award in Houston, but I think knowing you guys are one of the biggest small business lenders in the country and it sounds like there has been a lot of traction there, I guess not just for you guys within the second quarter, but it still feels like that\u2019s something that\u2019s carrying into the third quarter. I am kind of wondering why you are being a little bit more cautious for the loan growth outlook in the third versus a good second quarter and is this anything to do with the 504 run-off? And I guess second part of that question is can you update us on where the 504 national commercial real estate portfolio balances are quarter-over-quarter?", "Doyle Arnold", "No. It\u2019s not \u2013 the caution wasn\u2019t related to any expected change in the rate of 504 run-off, that\u2019s kind of its glide path that we have talked about. I guess it\u2019s probably more tempering just \u2013 some of it\u2019s tempered by the CRE limits that we are kind of enforcing for the time being until we get another read on stress testing at least and you have seen in the (EHA data), some pretty \u2013 three, three out of the last four weeks have been down for the industry for lending and we\u2019re despite the fact that pipelines remain pretty good and small business remains pretty good. We are hearing a little caution in overall and other aspects of the portfolio. James, you want to add any other commentary on that?", "James Abbott", "No, I was just filling the blank on the change. The portfolio of national real-estate loans is about a little over $3 billion, about $3.07 billion. It\u2019s divided between term commercial real-estate and owner occupied is about 60% owner occupied, 40% term commercial real-estate. The linked quarter decline on that portfolio was about $150 million. So, without that, our loan growth would have been a little bit obviously about $150 million stronger.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. And just \u2013 this is going to probably stabilize at $2 billion, is that what your guidance has been for the glide path?", "Doyle Arnold", "Current production levels, we\u2019ll put it about $1.5 billion, but we are starting to hear some green shoots. I would, it sounded this as I discussed it with the people in that group, it sounded like the green shoots of loan growth and credit quality back in 2009, you may have one or two blades of grass I think would be the description, but we are starting to hear some inquiries from community banks looking, they are starting to bump up against their liquidity ratio issues and are looking towards national real estate group as a source for that.", "Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. Thanks for your time guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Your line is open.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "Given when you have gone through all the CCAR process and it\u2019s been back and forth and you have given a high level of compliance, have you ever considered rather than raising equity capital looking to spin off a bank that where you can get a higher valuation than where the stock is trading now. And that would also lower your asset size below $50 billion, so you wouldn\u2019t have to deal with CCAR on a go forward basis, have you considered something like that rather than raising equity?", "Doyle Arnold", "Let me I have been answering this question a number of times Harris and I as well. I mean spinning off a bank even if we were to contemplate it \u2013 it probably doesn\u2019t get you where you are suggesting we might want to try to be. If you got down to $40 billion to $45 billion then normal growth is going to take you back to the $50 billion mark which is cast in law currently. Within a fairly short period of time and the last thing we are going to do is blow up the capabilities that were built at great cost and great pain even assuming the Fed would say yes you have escaped, you are off the hook. I think even that point is debatable. I think you have giving \u2013 taking that path is highly, highly uncertain to achieve the outcome you are suggesting.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "Okay. Thank you for taking my question.", "James Abbott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and External Communications", "Okay. That\u2019s the end of the questions that we have in the end. We are over time at this point, anyway. We thank you for participating in the call today. And if you have follow-up questions please email me it\u2019s James Abbott and I will be happy to respond. And thank you for your time and see you very soon at a conference.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s program. This concludes the program.

Davidson", "John Moran - Macquarie", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zions Bancorporation third quarter 2014 earnings call.[Operator instructions.] I would like to turn the call over to your host, James Abbott. Please go ahead.", "James Abbott", "Good evening, and thank you. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2014 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Scott McLean, President; and Michael Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. ", "A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your question to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. ", "Harris Simmons", "Thanks very much, James, and welcome to the call today. We\u2019ve taken a number of actions to reduce risk in our balance sheet over the past several years, including several significant actions taken during the third quarter, which I\u2019ll mention in a moment.", "As is noted in our release, we also issued $525 million of common equity in the third quarter, in response to the CCAR process, and that, in combination with our retained earnings, has resulted in our tier one common equity rising to nearly 12%, from 10.5% last quarter.", "The allowance for credit losses, really another form of capital, equaled 1.7% of loans, which is still stronger than most of our peers, despite having one of the lowest loan loss rates in recent quarters. ", "In addition to increasing our common equity, we\u2019ve significantly reduced the debt carried of the balance sheet. Since 2018, debt has averaged approximately $4.4 billion, which is equal to about 100% of tier one common equity for the same period.", "This quarter, we reduced debt to $1.3 billion, or just 24% tier one common at September 30. As noted in the press release, the reduction of debt in the third quarter will reduce interest expense by more than $50 million annually.", "With respect to credit risk, Zions\u2019 net loan losses have been among the best of the large U.S. commercial banks for several quarters now, and nonperforming assets continue to fall. They\u2019re now just 0.8% of loans in real estate owned. I expect that this improvement will likely place Zions in the top quartile of nonperforming asset ratios among our peers, once all of the banks have reported.", "Not particularly visible to most of you on the call, but of equal importance, we have significantly upgraded our risk and credit management practices, and will continue to make further refinements over time. ", "The examples include maintaining underwriting standards at very strong levels, despite some competitors that are granting credit at greater levels of leverage. We\u2019ve been maintaining robust standards of so-called phantom interest rates, which are interest rates that we use in the underwriting process to stress the cash flows of a borrower to determine how well the business will be able to service the debt if and when interest rates rise.", "During the past several years, we have substantially upgraded our credit rating process and reviews. We\u2019ve enhanced credit monitoring, we\u2019ve greatly enhanced our concentration risk management, and of course introduced stress testing and refined that process several times.", "As a result, we\u2019ve tightened the belt on some kinds of loans that exhibit high losses under actual and modeled stress. We\u2019ve further reduced our exposure to CDOs and construction and land development loans, primarily through increased syndications and participations.", "At the end of 2009, construction and land development loans, plus CDOs equaled $8.3 billion, or about 240% of our tier one common equity. Today, such assets equal only about $3 billion or about 56% of tier one common.", "We expect to continue to be very active construction and development lenders, but we\u2019re going to continue to actively use syndications and participations to control the volumes of these types of credits we carry on our own balance sheet, that are subject to stress testing.", "With respect to noninterest expenses, the headline number requires some adjustment to get to a number that would be more consistent with our ongoing operations. We\u2019ve noted some of those items in the press release, and Doyle will elaborate further in his remarks, but I would characterize the operational portion of expenses as being in line with our historical outlook, for about $1.6 billion annually for a little while.", "Recall we are significantly overhauling many of our information technology and accounting systems, much of which is expensed as it occurs. While these initiatives haven\u2019t expensed today, they\u2019re necessary to remain competitive, and we believe we will be able to become significantly more efficient as a result of the changes we are making.", "I want to assure you that we are very focused on expense control. Staffing has declined at the affiliate banks, but regulatory related costs continue to increase, in addition to the technology initiatives and their related costs. ", "Our outlook for noninterest expenses remains unchanged, at approximately $1.6 billion or about $400 million to $405 million per quarter on average throughout 2015.", "With that overview, I\u2019ll now ask Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle? ", "Doyle Arnold", "", "Thanks, Harris. Good evening everyone. Let me first note that I\u2019m toward the tail end of a very persistent cold, and the most persistent part of it is an occasional cough, so I apologize in advance, and I may ask James to stand by to pinch hit if things get out of control, but hopefully not.", "So for the third quarter of 2014, we posted net earnings to common shareholders of $79 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, as noted in the press release. This compares to earnings applicable to common of $104 million or $0.56 per diluted common share for the second quarter.", "We\u2019ve highlighted for you in the release a few of the larger items that caused noise in the results, I think all of which we\u2019ve talked about, and some of which we\u2019ve previously quantified for you. First of all, there was the expense related to debt extinguishment from the successful tender for $500 million of senior debt in September. That hurt earnings by about $0.14 per share.", "We sold additional CDO securities during the quarter at a small loss. The net impact was about $0.06 per share. Somewhat offsetting those were the negative provisions for credit losses, both the on balance sheet loans and the unfunded commitment reserve, which together totaled about $0.22 per share. Similar adjustments for prior periods are detailed in the release and in our 10Qs. ", "Harris already highlighted several of the key risk reduction actions that we took during the quarter, and many of you watched the press releases throughout the quarter regarding our equity issuance, debt extinguishment, and with this release, you can see the details about some other risk-reducing actions that also were taken.", "Commercial construction loan commitments have declined by more than $700 million, as compared to commitments at the time of our CCAR resubmission, which used a balance sheet date of December 31, 2013.", "Subsequent to the reduction, we\u2019ve also tightened somewhat our concentration limits for on balance sheet lending to constrain C&D growth on our balance sheet for stress testing purposes. As Harris noted, we\u2019re not exiting the business of construction lending. In fact, we expect to remain very active. However, we also expect to continue to use more syndication and participation arrangements to limit the on balance sheet exposure that is subject to stress testing.", "CDOs also declined materially as a result of both sales, primarily, but also paydowns at par. And we expect to continue to manage this portfolio down as long as market conditions remain conducive. There may be additional sales in the fourth quarter, in fact, again, depending upon market conditions.", "We\u2019re entering CCAR 2015 with capital ratios that are significantly higher than at December 31. As Harris already mentioned, the tier one common ratio is 17% higher, or 1.7 percentage points. And also, by extinguishing $835 million of debt, we\u2019ve reduced the risk of being unable to roll debt in the extreme meltdown or if it were rolled, the spreads on that debt, we\u2019ve eliminated the risk of them widening to extreme levels, as might be modeled under a stress test environment.", "Regardless of that, the debt reduction alone should improve pre-provision net revenue by at least $120 million over a nine-quarter planning scenario. And as you know, our PP&R, as projected under the Fed\u2019s stress test result was unusually low compared to peer institutions.", "With regard to noninterest expense, I\u2019ll make a few more comments. On page nine of the release, salaries and benefits increased by about $7 million this quarter. Much of the increase is attributable to further buildout of staffing needed for the technology replacement and enhancement projects. Many of those people were hired in June, so the third quarter number represents a full quarter of that expense.", "Additionally, as detailed in the release, we booked severance expense attributable to the consolidation of some loan operation centers that we expect to occur in the second half of next year. Those severance expenses totaled $5 million this quarter compared to a million dollars in the prior quarter. ", "Why book it so soon? The accounting rules require, as some of you know, that if you have an identified plan and you\u2019ve identified the people, etc., and met certain criteria, you have to go ahead and book that expense, even though the benefit may not be realized until sometime in the future. And we crossed that threshold with a very specific plan, and people have actually been notified and retention arrangements have been put in place related to those loan operations consolidations. ", "Also, there was an extra business day in the quarter that increased salary expenses by $4 million compared to the prior quarter, but that expense was offset on the bottom line by the additional revenue that also was derived from that additional day.", "Professional and legal expenses increased almost entirely due to outside consultants working on the technology projects, the stress testing, and the replacement of the chart of accounts and financial reporting systems. ", "That latter\u2019s probably in its peak spending phase now, through year-end, and then should start to taper off next year. And as you know, these technology projects are very key components of our efforts to, over the long term, control and reduce expenses. ", "The other major movement occurred in the provision for unfunded lending commitments. Most of the decline is attributable to a decline in unfunded commitments of loans that are in relatively higher historical loss categories, such as construction, which commitment level I described earlier. And that concludes that thought.", "It\u2019s difficult to forecast that line with any reasonable degree of accuracy, but we would generally expect it to be slightly positive over time, due primarily to growth in commitments. As Harris indicated, we\u2019ve indicated that we\u2019re attempting to keep overall noninterest expense levels flat during this process. We expect salary levels and some professional services to increase, largely offset by a decline in the indemnification assets related to the FDIC supported loans from the acquisition in 2009 and the decline in other credit related costs.", "I\u2019ll now move on to a review of some of the key revenue drivers, first turning to loans. Average loans held for investment were essentially stable compared to the prior quarter. Most of the loan growth occurred in the last part of the quarter, including residential loans purchased and construction loan participation sold.", "Many of you are aware of our intraquarter update, where we indicated the period in loans could be down, and that we expected average loans to be essentially flat to maybe slightly positive. Period end loans held for investment actually increased $110 million. That was the net of a lot of different moving parts, some of it organic and some of it related to increased participations sold and a portfolio of high quality jumbo arms purchased.", "C&I loans had a softer quarter, primarily impacted by some larger loans being paid down or paid off, some of which was driven by merger activity, and also competition from the capital markets as some companies issued notes to replace bank debt.", "Trying to loan production volume, that was approximately flat from a year ago. New loan pricing has been fairly stable in most categories. A shift in mix this quarter, the decline in construction lending more than offset by a strong increase in residential mortgage due to the purchase loans described did temporarily depress the coupon on new production this quarter by about 6 basis points to 3.71%.", "We don\u2019t expect this relatively residential heavy mix of production to persist going forward. That was driven by some specific actions on our part. On page 14 of the release, the GAAP yield on the portfolio, excluding FDIC supported loans, declined 4 basis points to approximately 4.24%. ", "The coupon on new production remains below the weighted average coupon rate of the portfolio, and therefore we expect additional modest compression of loan portfolio yield for the next several quarters. ", "Net investment income we\u2019ll note was $417 million, on page nine, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. We are encouraged with the third quarter stability of the headline net interest income. While it would be ideal to report positive sequential growth in net interest income, you may recall that we\u2019ve been deriving a significant benefit to net interest income from the loans purchased from the FDIC, again back in 2009.", "And that income source is now coming to its end. Just compared to the prior quarter, we experienced a $5 million decline in interest income from that source. If we exclude that effect on net interest income, NII has increased an annualized $47 million or about 3% compared to the same period a year ago. ", "Although we ceased providing core net interest income, we did commit to giving you the components, so that you could continue to calculate it, and we\u2019ll do so for the remainder of the year, and then I think they\u2019ll be small enough that we\u2019ll probably stop doing that.", "So the additional accretion on FDIC supported loans is found on the table at the bottom of page nine. It equals $7.7 million. And the discount amortization on subordinated debt was $4.9 million. Adjusting for these factors, there was about a $3 million linked quarter increase of net interest income, which is explained by the increase in the number of days in the quarter. ", "The net interest margin declined 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 3.2%. About 5 basis points of the decline was due to the increase in average money market investments, which increased nearly $1 billion sequentially. That was driven by several things, including the over half billion capital issuance and other actions that we took to build cash in order to pay down debt, which we did later in the quarter. We had the large tender offer and other payoffs of debt, which you can see on the balance sheet.", "So the cash balance fell considerably at the end of the quarter, which should add support to the NIM in the fourth quarter. The remaining 4 basis points of compression can be ascribed to the decline in income from the FDIC supported loans.", "As you know, we generally avoid giving outlook on the NIM, but it is worth noting that the debt extinguishment should add about 10 basis points to the NIM in the fourth quarter, before accounting for other factors.", "Brief comment on fee income. We do recognize that we have a proportionately low amount of fee income relative to the other large regional U.S. banks. We\u2019re actively working to narrow that gap, primarily through organic growth initiatives. The results from the third quarter are encouraging, and we\u2019re optimistic about our continued ability to grow that revenue over time.", "I\u2019ll kind of wrap up the opening here with some comments on the outlook. And again, these outlook comments are for the forward four quarters, relative to the quarter just ended. For loan growth, we\u2019re maintaining our slight to moderate loan growth outlook over the one-year time horizon. ", "For net interest income, on a GAAP basis, including the effect of an expected decline in interest income from the FDIC supported loans, we expect net interest income to increase slightly. The primary benefit will come from the debt extinguishment, which will add about $13 million prior quarter for the next several quarters, and there will be additional benefits late in 2015 as the remaining high cost subordinated debt matures and will be retired.", "Further declines in FDIC supported loan interest income will pressure the net interest income as will maturing loans that are replaced at lower yields, but again, adding all that together, we think net interest income will increase slightly.", "Regarding noninterest income, we expect core components of noninterest income, such as service fees, to continue a modest upward trend as we continue to press organic growth and fee income.", "Regarding noninterest expense, the outlook remains unchanged at approximately $1.6 billion annually or $400 million to $405 million prior quarter, on average for the next several quarters. Somewhat offsetting the expense increases related to the systems initiative should be continued reduction of FDIC indemnification asset expense amortization.", "Variables such as provision for unfunded lending commitments and legal expenses are difficult to forecast, and we generally would not expect additional transactions that would cause the provision for unfunded lending commitments to be as significantly negative as it was this third quarter.", "Regarding provision expense, given our expectation of continued improvements in the credit metrics that drive the ALLL methodology, we expect provision expense to remain modestly negative in the near term, although any reserve releases in this and future quarters are expected to be significantly smaller than those in the second and third quarters of this year.", "We\u2019re closely watching the recent turmoil in capital markets and abroad. While we do not see anything that would cause the quantitative portion of our models to reverse course, we note that the rate of reserve release from the qualitative portion could slow down, depending on what we see in the external environment. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator to open up the line for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "I guess I was curious a little bit about the purchase of the jumbo loans this quarter and just kind of some of the motivations behind that and the type of institution you bought them from. And it sounds like growth won\u2019t be as residential heavy going forward, but should we be expecting any purchase activity going forward?", "Doyle Arnold", "First of all, I\u2019ll note that the loans were very high quality jumbo ARMs in our western footprint. The preponderance of them were in California, but there were others that were scattered around all our other states. None of them was out of footprint. They were purchased from another banking institution, and the motivation predominantly was to balance off the reduction in earning assets that came from our focused attempt to reduce commercial C&D commitments and outstandings. ", "And by the way, what we participated out was also high quality, but fares less well under stress testing. So it was an attempt to rebalance the risk profile of the portfolio without materially impacting current and future earnings, and we think we accomplished that. ", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets ", "And then just a question on the C&I portfolio. There was some growth this quarter, but as I recall, maybe in one of your intraquarter updates, you talked about possibly seeing some outsized paydowns and maybe pulling back in the energy area. So just wondered if you could talk about just trends in the C&I portfolio in general, and perhaps any change in utilization rates as well.", "Doyle Arnold ", "I\u2019m going to let James start with that one.", "James Abbot", "Basically, I would characterize it as we had a mixed quarter from some of the banks. Typically, Amegy, for example, has a very strong C&I quarter on a very regular basis, but Amegy did experience some paydowns this quarter due to some companies that were either issued debt in the public markets and replaced bank debt, or sold the companies outright and so forth. So that was one of the sources of pressure. ", "Zions Bank in Utah had really strong growth in C&I, actually. About $117 million. So you really had kind of mixed results from the various different banks.", "On the owner occupied side, which includes some of the small business lending, it was just a soft quarter in general, and a lot of that was driven by Zions Bank continuing. As you know, they have the national real estate group, and that continues to run down, primarily due to supply. Just a lack of supply coming from that particular market right now, with liquidity being as robust as it is across the industry.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets ", "And any change in utilization rates that you could pick up at all?", "James Abbott", "No change in utilization rates. I believe it\u2019s 33%, which is unchanged from the prior quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ", "Maybe just start off, in terms of the construction portfolio, obviously big reduction this quarter. But now that you\u2019re past the CCAR client information date, I guess, the September 30 date, I know you said you still wanted to be active in construction, but you also said you wanted to not hold a lot of construction. Like, where do we go from here? Do we see absolute reductions in construction over the next several quarters? Or do you feel that you have a little leeway where you don\u2019t need to do that?", "Doyle Arnold ", "I don\u2019t foresee major reductions from here, but neither should you expect to see major growth in the on balance sheet portion, certainly not until we get another CCAR result and see just how this portfolio does fare. ", "But I do believe that, as I said in my remarks, and I think Harris as well, this is a business that we think we do very well, we certainly want to remain active in, and even grow from the standpoint of client relationships, etc. But in a stress test world, the growth has to be more of an originate and syndicate, originate participate a portion of it model. We can\u2019t keep as much of it on our balance sheet as we maybe historically have. ", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ", "And then my second question, in terms of the qualitative reserve, I think you said that was kind of slow in terms of its release. Can you just quantify some of that? How much do you feel that you have that\u2019s excess qualitative reserves? And how much was actually released this quarter? ", "Doyle Arnold ", "The answer to your first question is zero. If I thought I had excess, I would have released more, by definition. The answer to the second is I\u2019m not sure the exact number, but I think the majority of the release was driven by credit quality metric improvements and the volume of loans. And the third contributor might have been some adjustment in the qualitatives.", "Harris Simmons ", "It was about a 60-40 split, Ken, about 60% of the reserve release was quantitative and 40% was the qualitative portion of the release, which is actually not that different from the composition of the reserve overall.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. ", "John Pancari - Evercore", "Question on the loan growth. So it sounds like you\u2019re not going to be buying anymore production or ramping up purchases in resi mortgages from here. Can you talk to us about total loan growth, because you just implied that construction should be somewhat muted, although not declining incrementally, so how should we think about total loan growth balances, all that being said, in the coming quarters.", "Doyle Arnold ", "Well, very crudely put, on page ten, if you look at the numbers there, construction and land development declined by $450 million, and one to four family increased by $300 million, but $100 million of that was our own production. ", "So if you zero out the C&D shrinkage and zero out the purchase, you basically are adding about $200 million to this quarter\u2019s loan growth, and your back end of the $300 million or $400 million a quarter that I think is consistent with our guidance of whatever we\u2019ve been saying, moderate? You know, add that up over the course of a year and you\u2019re somewhere in a $1.5 billion range? ", "This was a one-time, at least that\u2019s the way we\u2019re conceiving of it now, rebalancing of the on balance sheet portfolio.", "John Pancari - Evercore ", "Right. So the need to replace the runoff in C&D with the purchase, like you did this quarter, you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re going to have that need next quarter? Because the majority of the C&D runoff has occurred?", "Doyle Arnold ", "Well, it wasn\u2019t runoff, it was actual participations and syndications sold, with some conversion to term, which goes on all the time. But trying to actually bring the totals down materially by increased participations was a one-time thing. Using participations to keep it from growing back, rapidly, if you will, is something that we\u2019ll do, but we\u2019re not at the present time trying to further shrink the on balance sheet part of C&D.", "John Pancari - Evercore ", "And then my last one, kind of back to Ken\u2019s question, on the reserve, with it sitting here around 154 basis points currently, what would you view as a good bottom longer term with your reserve ratio, just given what you\u2019re seeing right now on your credit front?", "Doyle Arnold ", "That\u2019s a question I\u2019m just not going to answer. I have to follow GAAP, and it will be what it will be. But there\u2019s nothing on the credit quality metric outlook that causes me to think that that reserve coverage ratio, whichever one you want to look at, has to go back up. And aim, the pressures are for slight further reductions, at least in the next quarter or two. At some point, it has to end, but I don\u2019t know when.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank ", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "I was just wondering if you had any updated thoughts on where you stand on the LCR, and how much excess liquidity you guys think you have right now that you can reduce over time?", "Doyle Arnold ", "On a consolidated basis, we think we pass the LCR on a fully phased in basis, with a little bit of room to spare. And some banks, we have a lot of excess liquidity. At others, we\u2019re probably a little short. So there, over time, needs to be some rebalancing there. I think rather than give you a precise number, with the kind of loan growth that I described, I don\u2019t see the LCRs being a material constraint on loan growth in the near to medium term. But there\u2019s no question but what we and everybody else are going to be managing permanently to a larger cash and HQLA high quality liquid asset kind of securities portfolio than we might have been historically. ", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank ", "And then how much cash do you guys have at the parent at this point?", "Doyle Arnold ", "A lot [laughter]. I think over $900 million.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank ", "And any other thoughts about paying down borrowings or anything like that?", "Doyle Arnold ", "Yes, we\u2019re looking at the appropriate use of that cash and certainly some of it, as I mentioned, we have some very expensive subdebt maturing in the first quarter of next year, which we\u2019ll certainly want to pay off. When I say very expensive, it has an effective GAAP interest expense cost of over 20%. It\u2019s the last of the modified subdebt. ", "But beyond that, I think we\u2019ll wait for the CCAR resubmission and capital plan to come together and then tell you what, if anything, we\u2019re going to do with some of that cash. There are a number of potential ways to use that to benefit the shareholders. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ", "We have just one question. You mentioned that you were executing on organic growth initiatives. Would you be able to outline some of those?", "Doyle Arnold ", "Well, that was specifically with regard to fee income. I believe we have commented on them a number of times. There\u2019s nothing really new. Harris, do you want to talk about that? Or turn it over to Scott McLean?", "Harris Simmons ", "We\u2019re seeing good growth in commercial cards. We\u2019re seeing revenue increasing there at a pretty good clip. We continue to see growth in our treasury management income. Mortgage banking is something we\u2019re focused on doing more of, but it\u2019s obviously a tough market to be actually gaining traction in. But we expect that through the cycle we\u2019ll be doing more of that. And wealth management has been another area of focus for us. ", "So those are some of the really primary areas. I think that probably one of the risks on the horizon for anybody who\u2019s really heavily consumer oriented is going to be overdraft income, and so we\u2019re not trying to push that pedal any further. We think that that\u2019s probably not going to be a growth area. Service charges on deposit accounts generally is not going to see a lot of growth, but some of these other areas, we think there\u2019s some good growth potential in them. ", "Scott McLean", "Doyle, this is Scott. I would think Harris summarized it well. I would just add to that that we\u2019re seeing the benefit of much stronger product development at the corporate level, and then these products being delivered locally. ", "Treasury management, which represents about 30% of our fee income, is a good example of that. Credit card represents about 20% of our fee income, and it is a really good example of that too, where the product is being developed much more effective centrally, and then coordinating the delivery at the local level. Mortgage, we\u2019re going through that today, and we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for a community bank model like us to have really good, strong mortgage fee income potential. ", "Doyle Arnold ", "For those of you who don\u2019t recognize it, that last voice was that of Scott McLean, who was CEO of Amegy Bank, and we drafted Scott early this year to become president of Zions Bancorp. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. ", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "A bit of a bigger picture question. How do you think about the pros and cons of running the structure with the multiple subsidiaries and banking charters? And what could prompt you to reexamine that?", "Harris Simmons ", "Well, I guess I\u2019d say that we see a lot of pros given our mix of business, which is very heavily oriented toward small to middle market kinds of businesses. And it\u2019s a really good model of relationship management. The need and the opportunity is really to figure out how we get more cost out of this, particularly with what we deliver centrally, and we\u2019re very focused on that. ", "That\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re investing in some of these technology projects that will allow us to take some additional cost out and operate a lot of the back office much more consistently across the enterprise. But it is something that we continue to study and be very focused on how we do this in a way that preserves the best of what we think this model delivers in the way of\u2026 And what we\u2019re trying to do locally, but gets us more cost savings. There\u2019s still opportunity on the cost side, I think for sure. ", "I\u2019ve noted to some folks recently that\u2026 I mean, one measure of how composition of our balance sheet differs from others is if you look at small business loans, it\u2019s a big part of what we do. If you look at the total loans, from $100,000 to $1 million in size\u2026 I\u2019d go up further than that, but that\u2019s the limit of a call report and what it captures in the way of small business lending. ", "But using that as a proxy, we make 50% as much of that kind of credit available to clients across our footprint as JPMorgan Chase does across the United States of America. And for that kind of business, we actually think that having this very community bank like structure has been a great help, in helping us to gain market share and up into the middle market kinds of companies that we serve in a lot of these markets. ", "We\u2019ve got really good reputational kind of scores, in local surveys, etc. But we know that that has to be accompanied by a cost structure that works, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. ", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research ", "And what sorts of timelines should we be thinking about for seeing these expense benefits?", "Harris Simmons ", "As I\u2019ve articulated, on a number of occasions with investors, we have several major projects, each of which will ramp its peak spend, and then begin to achieve its savings in a sort of overlapping sequence. As I mentioned, the front end loan system is already developed, and is in the process of implementation, so we built that and began the process of installing it without you noticing the run up in expenses for that one.", "We\u2019re at the peak spend on the financial reporting and accounting project now, and we\u2019ll be implementing that next year. We\u2019re at the peak spend. That will then taper off, but those savings are going to be in fact reinvested in the core transformation project that we\u2019ve talked about, and so forth. So the goal is to basically keep the expenses in total flat over the next number of quarters. And then the actual reduction comes probably out at least a couple of years from now. ", "I would note that the Federal Reserve is placing renewed emphasis on all banks, if you look at the CCAR 2015 instructions that just came out. Look at the range of practices document that they published last year. They\u2019re focusing ever more intently on the quality of bank systems, noting that many are antiquated and need to be upgraded. They cannot meet the data requirements with the versatility that they expect going forward.", "I would suggest to you that we\u2019re probably at the front end of more than one bank, particularly regional banks, that will be needing to upgrade their systems over the next few years.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research ", "But doesn\u2019t having multiple charters make it harder to have best-in-class systems?", "Doyle Arnold ", "Which is the last question that we\u2019re going to take on that, then we\u2019re going to move on. But the answer is, the charters themselves don\u2019t add that much cost. It\u2019s all in the way one implements it. ", "So historically, yes they have, because we have historically allowed each bank to customize things a lot to the way these systems are implemented and run, to suit its own desires. As a part of this overhaul of the system, we are kind of undoing a lot of that customization, because we have to, to get the data consistency, the risk reporting consistency, in a more efficient way. ", "What we\u2019re doing now is we\u2019re getting it done, but it\u2019s very manually intensive in some areas, in some ways, and very complicated to do. So you need to divorce a lot of your thinking, in my opinion, about the cost of multiple charters from the cost of multiple systems implementations.", "So that\u2019s kind of the approach we\u2019re taking. In the interest of time, I need to move on to another question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson. ", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson", "Question on expenses. Can you talk about real estate rationalization and what your thoughts are with regard to branches or office space, and what you think you might be doing there over the next six to eight quarters?", "Harris Simmons ", "I\u2019d start by noting that we\u2019ve reduced, from 2009 to the present time, we\u2019ve reduced the number of branches by about 12.5%, I think is the last number I saw. And that\u2019s a process that continues. We continue to look at branches. And I would note that one of the things I think all banks are wrestling with right now, we\u2019re in this very low interest rate environment, and the nominal value of branches today, in a lot of cases, doesn\u2019t look great, because the value you attribute to deposits is not very significant today.", "But in a normalized rate environment, and particularly under the new liquidity rules in this industry, we think it\u2019s something everybody\u2019s going to have to be careful about, and kind of this transition to more mobile and digital channel use, and kind of what the role of the branches are.", "All of that said, we\u2019re continuing, we\u2019ll have some further branch closures in the fourth quarter, some of which haven\u2019t been yet announced. And I don\u2019t have a target in mind, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re continuing to kind of scrub. And we\u2019re particularly trying to really drill down on how staffing requirements are changing, because the real cost of branches isn\u2019t in the number of locations, or the real estate component of it, so much as it is in the staffing. And so that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be paying more attention to.", "So those are some kind of general thoughts, but we\u2019re down. I think at our peak, we were, kind of gross, with acquisitions of banks from the FDIC, etc., back in 2009, the end of 2009, we\u2019re up at well over 500 branches. We\u2019re now down to around 465.", "Scott McLean", "I think we\u2019re pushing 550 if you just take the gross number.", "Harris Simmons ", "So we\u2019ve actually been doing more than we make a lot of noise about, but it\u2019s a process that continues.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson ", "Do you have a sense of what the average square footage is on your branches, or average staffing level?", "Harris Simmons ", "I have some sense as to the average staffing level. At least I have the data. I don\u2019t have it right here with me, but it\u2019s something that we could probably follow up on. As far as square footage, I don\u2019t have that right available, but it is something that we have generally been reducing. ", "The one exception, we\u2019d had branches in grocery stores. We closed a lot of those. In some cases, we built the freestanding branches, and then tend to, by their nature, they\u2019re smaller ones, but they tend to be a little larger than kind of the in-store kind of footprint. But that\u2019s something that we continue to focus on, is just how much real estate we need. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "On loan yield, can you talk to us about how much more rollover you\u2019re seeing, and anticipate seeing, as you look out those next four quarters on the go-to loan yields versus rolloff? And then attached to it is just, is there any rate forecast in your expectations for slight growth in NII?", "Doyle Arnold ", "No rate forecast. So that\u2019s not assuming a significant Fed tightening or increase in rates. I\u2019ll point out that we have, in our investor decks, showed you that gap between the current production and the portfolio average, but I think James can give you a quick summary of it here on the line.", "James Abbott", "Most of the difference between, as Doyle mentioned in the prepared remarks, was because of a shift in the mix of production this quarter. We had more than double the amount of residential and the loans we\u2019ve purchased counted as production there. That\u2019s why there was a decline in yield. Outside of that, we saw small business loan yields decline a little bit linked quarter. Otherwise, most loan yields were fairly stable, and the line managers report to us that they\u2019re seeing general stability in market pricing. So we probably have about 20 basis points of gap between new production pricing and the book of business. And it turns over in about two and a half, maybe three years. So that\u2019ll give you some stuff to work with.", "Doyle Arnold ", "So back to the first part of your question, the gap is now narrow enough that kind of any swing in interest rates from the Fed could swamp it.", "James Abbott", "Yeah, a 25 basis point rate hike, our production wouldn\u2019t then [unintelligible] the book of business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Following up on Harris\u2019s earlier comments that debt is now down to 24% of tier one common, where are you targeting that to go to? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much debt gets replaced versus net paid down going forward.", "Doyle Arnold ", "I would say the bulk of the reduction is done at this point, and there are potentially other uses for cash that we\u2019ll wait to talk about those until the appropriate time. But I think clearly the amount of debt we had was a drag on PP&R, on earnings, and unnecessary. And I think at this point, as I said, the biggest change to debt that you could look to is likely the payoff of some subordinated debt with a very high cost next year. And maybe it just gets paid off, maybe we replace some of that with new lower cost debt.", "Only caveat to that answer would be there\u2019s occasional still noise about the Fed requiring certain levels of debt, of [unintelligible] institutions. Nothing formal, but there\u2019s wars and rumors of wars still abound, from time to time out there. But we\u2019re largely done, I think, with what we plan to do.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America ", " ", "If they raise the bar from $50 billion to anything higher, does that change your forward outlook for loan growth or expenses?", "Doyle Arnold", "[laughter] Yes. The answer is probably yes to both, dammit, both.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. ", "Lana Chan - BMO Capital Markets", "Just a quick question on LCR. I guess I\u2019m not sure whether you need to remix the securities portfolio for more HQLA assets?", "Doyle Arnold ", "Our cash is the HQiest of any asset, and we have a lot of that. That aside, the CDOs are clearly the least liquid. They\u2019re not helpful at all, and we commented on continuing to work those down. Kind of in between those two extremes, we will be looking at, without dramatically changing our asset sensitive position in the near term, kind of what\u2019s the right mix of some Ginnies, some Fannies, or other HQLA and not have it all in cash going forward. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Compass Point. ", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "Given where your fee income is right now, and your initiatives to grow it, what percentage of revenue do you think will come from fee income a couple of years down the road?", "Harris Simmons ", "That\u2019s not something you change overnight, and particularly given that some substantial portions of the total mix are coming from deposit service charges. As I [unintelligible], I think you\u2019re just not going to see much growth in that category across the industry.", "Doyle Arnold ", "The only way to change it quickly would be to acquire something, and acquiring something entails large premiums, and in this environment, it\u2019s going to be organic, therefore it\u2019s going to be incremental. And therefore, it will take a number of years to move the needle by four or five percentage points.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. ", "Gary Tenner - D.A. Davidson", "I was just wondering if you could quantify the amount of the construction book that moved over to term versus what you\u2019ve moved off balance sheet otherwise.", "Doyle Arnold ", "We\u2019ll have to follow up with you on that one. I\u2019m afraid none of us brought that information with us. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Moran with Macquarie.", "John Moran - Macquarie", "I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned it in the prepared remarks and I just missed it, but if you didn\u2019t, would you mind quantifying what the fully phased in Basel III capital ratio is?", "Doyle Arnold ", "We didn\u2019t, so new question. It\u2019s about 11.6%. It\u2019s just a few basis points below, about 25 basis points or so below the Basel I number.", "Operator", "This ends the Q&A session for today. I\u2019ll turn it back to management for closing remarks.", "James Abbott", "Thank you everyone for joining. Appreciate your attention here today, and we will be happy to take follow up questions through email or on the phone. You can reach me directly. My information is on the website.

This call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to James Abbott.", "James Abbott", "Thank you Jenny and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss the fourth quarter 2014 earnings. Our participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Scott McLean, President; and Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer and Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer.", "I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although the actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. ", "A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your question to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris Simmons", "Thanks very much James and welcome to all of you who are on the call and those on the East Coast, we can only say we wish we had some of the snow issues you\u2019re currently experiencing this evening here on our mountains. We could use it. Based on other calls we\u2019ve listened to, we expect that a major focus at this earnings call will be on our energy portfolio and we\u2019ve included a significant amount of information in the earnings release on that topic.", "We expect some deterioration in the portfolio as a result of the sharp decline in energy prices, particularly if price levels remain low for a long period of time. However, we\u2019re also feeling very confident that we\u2019ve maintained strong underwriting discipline and risk management throughout the last several quarters and several years for that matter, and that in combination with our strong capital position and loan loss reserves, we should navigate this bump reasonably well. We\u2019ve asked Scott McLean our President to add further color in our prepared remarks here in a few minutes.", "But before we turn to that discussion, I wanted to make a few comments about earnings for 2014 and the progress on some of our initiatives. The 2014 results improved from the prior year with net income applicable to common shareholders rising to $333 million from $294 million a year ago. We experienced relatively stable net interest income; despite two significant headwinds, the winding down of the FDIC supported loan portfolio and pricing pressure on new loans. 2015 net interest income should be the first year of increasing net interest income since 2008, which is very encouraging to us.", "Fee income growth has not met our expectations, in part due to a slower pace of mortgage originations than was originally anticipated. Mortgage banking was a headwind for us and for the rest of the industry in 2014. With mortgage rates having inched down somewhat once again, we hope to see some help from increased mortgage banking activities in 2015. I\u2019ll save my comments on expenses until after I discuss some of our other initiatives, but we do expect revenue growth to exceed non-interest expense growth in 2015.", "I\u2019d like to talk for a moment about debt and preferred share levels and the reductions we\u2019ve made. We made solid progress on reducing the effect of debt and preferred dividends on our earnings during this past year. Interest expense on debt declined $63 million to $123 million and using the fourth quarter results, the annualized rate was only 75 million. Dividends on preferred equity declined by $24 million to $72 million and we hope to continue to reduce costs in both of those areas in 2015.", "A major thing for Zions for the past several years has also been to improve our capital ratios and strengthen the quality of that capital. Today our capital ratios are among the best in the industry, both in quality and quantity and we\u2019ve made significant progress in reducing the cost of such capital. To the extent that we see further slowing in the global economy, we believe we are very well positioned to weather that well. We've also invested a great deal in upgrading our risk management in the past few years and it shows in having a very low net charge-off ratio relative to the industry and a low non-performing loans ratio. We believe the actions taken in recent years have positioned the Company to experience less loan loss volatility than peers through the credit cycle.", "Fee income in 2014 was higher than in 2013 although most of the difference is explained by security schemes and losses. We experienced solid growth in treasury management and credit card revenues. However these gains were partially offset by softness in mortgage related fee income. This area, fee income remains a major focus for us and we will continue to re-double our efforts in this area. ", "We announced some technology initiatives about 18 months ago. As many of you know, we are significantly overhauling many of our information technology and accounting systems. This began as a risk management initiative but will have a cost savings impact to it as well. And I am pleased to report that our chart of accounts has been completely overhauled and the mid-January conversion to our new chart of accounts went extremely smoothly. We've reduced the total number of line items by well over half, simplifying our chart of accounts structure here in the Company. ", "Other elements of our initiatives are all on schedule and costs are tracking slightly better than expected. While these initiatives have an expense today, we really do believe they are necessary to remain competitive out into the future and we believe we\u2019ll be able to become significantly more efficient as a result of changes.", "On the expense front, related to our technology initiative, we're very focused on expense control. As technology advances we're able to reduce certain labor intensive tasks. We\u2019re still fine tuning our outlook for cost savings which should come from these technology initiatives and expect to provide you an outlook a little later this year. We've given an outlook for total non-interest expense to roughly equal $1.6 billion for 2014, and excluding the debt restructuring expense we came in at $1.61 billion. So very, very close to the target. ", "With that overview I am going to ask Doyle Arnold to review the financial results. Doyle?", "Doyle Arnold", "Thank you, Harris. Good evening everyone, as noted in the release, the net income available to common for the full year is $333 million or a $1.71 per diluted common share, compared to $294 million or a $1.58 per diluted common share in 2013. For the fourth quarter we posted net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $73.2 million, which was $0.36 per diluted common share, compares to net earnings applicable to common of $79.1 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the third quarter.", "The biggest swing factor by far in the fourth quarter compared to the third was a provision expense which increased $84 million was the amount on the change, from a negative $71 million to a positive $13 million. Much of the release in the allowance for credit losses in the third quarter was due to the sale of several $100 million construction loans in that quarter, which generally carry a high reserve ratio. But for the substantial decline in energy prices in the fourth quarter, we would have had another modest reserve release in the fourth quarter as we've previously indicated, because underlying credit quality metrics or statistics continue to improve during the quarter. ", "I\u2019ll move on now to a brief review of some of the key revenue drivers. Average loans held for investment increased $278 million compared to third quarter and end of period balances increased $324 million. The pattern in this quarter was a little different than fourth quarter patterns for the last several years in that it occurred -- the growth occurred fairly steadily throughout the quarter and we did not see the sharp acceleration there in loan growth in the final weeks near the end of the quarter that we have in recent previous years. So that pickup at the end was not the outliner compared to the whole year pattern that it has been.", "For 2014 as a whole, loan growth was approximately $1 billion or 2.6%, consistent with our outlook at the beginning of the year for slight to moderate loan growth. The increase was muted due to loan sales and participations for risk reduction purposes that we talked about last quarter, and also continued run off of loans from the national real-estate group, the latter being a pressure that we expect to continue through 2015.", "We also expect growth in 2015 to be about in line with 2014. We see improved economies in most of our footprint, although Texas and Amegy Bank may likely produce slower growth this year than last, in part due to potential effects of the decline in energy prices and energy related activity.", "Net interest income, despite the significant improvement in interest expense through debt reductions that were mentioned, net interest income declined slightly in 2014 due to the decline in margin on earning assets. The decline in interest income is largely due to the reduction in the benefit from the FDIC supported loans, something that we have indicated would be a significant headwind to revenue growth. Revenue from loans excluding those FDIC supported loan portfolios declined much more modestly, despite an increase in the size of the portfolio due to continued price pressure.", "While we continue to experience pricing pressure, the decline in the loan yields in recent quarters has been more mild than it was a year or two ago. For the quarter, total net interest income was $430 million, a 3% increase from the prior quarter but essentially unchanged from the year ago period. Excluding the effect of the declining FDIC supported loan income over that period, net interest income actually increased about 5% compared to the year ago period, and most of that is attributable to the redemption of high cost debt which took place throughout the year 2014.", "Compared to the prior quarter, the net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.25%. The strong deposit inflow of up to $1.6 billion or 3.4% sequentially and the slower loan growth resulted in an increase in average money market investments, which pressured the NIM by about 3 basis points.", "The purchase of residential mortgage backed securities during the quarter pressured the NIM somewhat, but served to increase net interest income. The agency RMBS securities purchased at a duration of about 3.3 years and if rates were to rise by 200 basis points that duration would extend to about four years.", "Turning to fee income, there is some noise in the number. During the quarter we experienced a $15 million increase in the valuation of an investment held at two small business investment Company funds, which was split between two line items because in one page we had a controlling interest in the fund and the other we did not. The two line items were dividends and equity securities gains. That $15 million increase was partially offset by marking to estimated realizable value certain other private equity fund investments that will be divested pursuant to the Volcker Rule.", "I\u2019d also note there was a $12 million loss on the sale of CDO securities during the quarter. We sold about a 150 million par value of CDOs in the quarter, again for risk reduction purposes and that shows up in the fix income securities gains and losses line. There is no OTTI during the quarter, I believe.", "For coming [ph] on non-interest expense, salaries and benefits decreased by about $7 million compared to the prior quarter. Much of the decrease is attributable to fact that we had $5 million of severance cost in the third quarter as discussed then and very de minimis severance cost included in this quarter. We also reversed an accrual for healthcare benefits where we have over accrued some expenses that came in little lower than projected.", "Professional and legal increased $10 million from the prior quarter, mainly due to consulting fees related to the Company\u2019s CCAR processes, including model validations and preparation of the submission. We do hope and expect that that number will not be as significant as we prepare the next CCAR. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in institutionalizing some of that activity.", "We continue to employ outside consultants however, working on technology projects and the replacement of the chart of accounts and financial reporting system, systems, which those projects are now on their kind of peak spending phases. These technology projects are key to our efforts to long-term control and reduce expenses and we expect as I said lower overall expenses in 2015 on the professional and legal line that we did this year.", "With that overview, I\u2019m going to now turn sometime over to my colleague Scott McLean. For those of you who have not yet met Scott, he has been President of the Company for about a year, just under a year now, but prior to that spent several years as CEO of Amegy Bank and has been with Amegy Bank and other banks in the Houston area and very knowledgeable energy lending practices, both now and in the past and I\u2019m going to let Scott go into little bit more depth about energy portfolio. Scott?", "Scott McLean", "Great. Thanks, Doyle. I am happy to add some additional color of what we already put in the press release regarding energy lending as the way to reduce the uncertainty that I think comes from a lack of information and understanding when you go through a cycle like this. As Harris indicated earlier, we believe that our disciplined underwriting, strong capital and loan loss reserve positions position us well to whether this current period of oil and gas price volatility.", "I want to try to highlight four key elements that should be helpful to you as you think about our exposure. First, as it regards historical losses on energy loans, they have been limited to approximately 1% in our peak year of 2009. Importantly, over the last seven years, cumulative losses were approximately 3% of the balance of loans outstanding entering that period. Relative to the loan portfolio, these charges offs -- relative to the overall loan portfolio of the Company, these charge offs have represented a very small number of basis points in our net charge off ratio.", "Many of you will recall though that the price of oil dropped significantly, starting in the spring of 2008 and then rebounded within about 12 to 15 month period. And no one knows if oil prices will rebound from the current 50% plus decline in the last few months. However though it is also worth recalling that natural gas prices also fell significantly in the 2008-2009 period, and those prices have not rebounded fundamentally. Gas production was a very significant component of most exploration companies and impacted energy service companies\u2019 revenues as well at that time. And in many cases, it was more than 50% of total production back then. So losses from that period are certainly relevant to the current outlook.", "The second comment I would make is that we\u2019ve had very disciplined underwriting process over the years, and as well, in the utilization of concentration limit. Both of these have effectively limited our energy loan growth to very modest rates in recent periods. Although this loan will not prevent all losses, it is very effective, concentration limits, and our approach to underwriting is -- are effective risk management tools that have held us in good stead in the last several years.", "The third element I\u2019d like to mention is just the fact that are energy companies that are in our portfolio have other sources of support that differentiate them. These energy companies have access to capital markets and private equity sources beyond what many companies have. We saw good support from the private equity sponsors that are actively involved with many of our clients during the 2008-2009 downturn, whereas that source of support was really never there in the 1980s, which was another very notable period of price volatility.", "Approximately 30% of our exposure in the energy portfolio is to public companies and approximately 45% have private equity sponsors. And the private equity firms we partner with have exceptionally strong experience in the industry and understand the cyclicality as opposed to generalist firms or younger, less experienced firms. Additionally, the remainder of our portfolio generally has private sponsors, very high net worth families that have been highly involved in the energy industry over the years.", "Finally, the -- really the most important aspect I\u2019d like to describe is just the loan by loan basis that we have underwritten our portfolio by. And we believe it has historically allowed us, and will going forward allow us, to withstand a sharp decline in energy prices without experiencing a sharp increase in loan losses. I\u2019m going to repeat some of what is in the release, but I think it is worth punctuating.", "It\u2019s important to know that we have no junior liens or subordinated debt in the portfolio. And we avoid equally as important making first lien loans if there is substantial leverage behind us as it raises default risk. Additionally, more than 90% of the portfolio is secure. The largest loans in our portfolio have an average loan grade that maps to a BB+ rating. This would be for all loan commitments that exceed 30 million in commitment value, which is about one quarter of our portfolio.", "Of particular importance, during the underwriting process for reserve based loans, we apply multiple discounts to the value of the collateral as provided by the borrower and validated by third party engineering firms. I\u2019ll highlight here a few, and happy to take follow up questions on this as well because it\u2019s just so fundamental understanding the conservativeness of the underwriting process we use.", "First, for a wide variety of reasons, we generally exclude from consideration much of a borrower\u2019s available collateral. This first discount often is in the range of 10% to 40% of the reserves that the borrower presents to us at the time of their request. Secondly the Bank\u2019s oil and gas price deck, the pricing that we apply to a borrower\u2019s reserves has historically been below the NYMEX strip at any particular current period.", "Third borrowing bases are generally set at 60% to 70% of the available collaterals after the discounts that I just mentioned above. Additionally borrowers generally exercise caution and do not draw the maximum available cash on their lines. The line utilization rate on reserve based loan commitments was 57% at December 31, 2014.", "This discussion in utilization gives us the ability to reduce a line of credit and many of customers would not experience the need to sell assets or raise equity to bring the loan back in the confirmative with the borrowing base. That said, our contracts require an equity cushion. So we will not separately sit on our hands if the loan to collateral value exceeds 95% or 100%. We are constantly working with our borrowers to reinstate an acceptable equity cushion at all times and quite frankly that is in their best interest as well.", "Let me comment briefly about hedging, hedging commodity prices is a fairly common practice by our customers, with oil hedging representing about 50% of oil production in both 2015 and 2016. When hedging is not utilized sufficiently, we apply much steeper discounts to the collateral value when making a commitment. ", "A few final comments regarding our energy services portfolio. Our energy services loans underwriting criteria requires lower leverage to compensate for the cyclical nature of that collection of industries. We shot cash flow EBITDA levels down significantly, up to 60% with an average of 33% to determine each borrower\u2019s viability under stress.", "Many of our loans have debt to EBITDA ratios less than one in a quarter and the typical transaction has cash flow leverage in the one and a half range and below, which is quite conservative relative to industry norms for general, commercial and industrial lending. So individually, all of these steps that I\u2019ve referenced provides substantial protection, but taken together we feel we prepared to handle the situation that we currently face with oil and gas prices with a relatively modest impacts to net charge-offs and overall profitability. James?", "James Abbott", "Thank you, Scott. Next Doyle will provide the financial outlook and then we will take your questions. Doyle?", "Doyle Arnold", "Thanks James and thank you and Scott. Outlook is for the forward four quarters, relative to our most recent quarter. It\u2019s not meant to be a quarter-by-quarter prognostication, in kind of keeping with our past practice. Regarding loan growth, we\u2019re going to maintain our slight to moderate growth outlook for loans. This does factor in the effects of what could be a slowing Texas market for reasons we\u2019ve been talking about, but offset by strengthening economies in other parts of our footprint. Regarding net interest income, we expect that to increase slightly due to continued loan growth and modest securities purchases, although there will be pressure in the first quarter due to too fewer days in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So just bear that in mind.", "So I just made a liar out of myself. I did talk about a specific quarter rather than the full year but don\u2019t be alarmed. We expect to redeem additional very high cost debt, subordinated debt in the third and fourth quarters, which will reduce interest expense late in this year. You won\u2019t even see the full benefit of that in fourth quarter, but you will through the year 2016.", "Regarding non-interest income we expect the core components, such as service fees to continue a modest upward trend as we continue to strive for organic loan growth and fee income. On the non-interest expense side, our outlook for non-interest expense remains about the same for 2015, that is $405 million, $410 million per quarter, in other words kind of keeping overall expenses flat for another year or nearly so as the technology projects experience their expected peak year of incremental spend.", "Regarding provision expense, that\u2019s probably the biggest change from 2014. At the current time we do not expect additional reserve releases in 2015. We do expect the provision will be positive for the year and likely for each quarter, driven by net charge-offs, loan growth and a possible increase in the adversely created loans in the energy book.", "Net charge-offs for 2014 were approximately $42 million, which is a pretty low rate, even though it included couple of special situations. Nevertheless, with energy prices at current levels, NCOs could increase somewhat from that level, particularly later in the year as we get updated financials the take into account the full impact of what\u2019s been going on in the last couple of months with regard to energy prices.", "With that, we\u2019ll turn it back to James and our operator to open the line for your questions.", "James Abbott", "Thanks, Jamie, if you would open up the line, that\u2019d be great.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI.", "Steve Moss", "It\u2019s actually Steve Moss for John. Just want to start off with the energy portfolio. Kind of wondering how much do you guys have in terms of reserves allocated to the portfolio?", "Harris Simmons", "The allowance for credit losses to the portfolio. It\u2019s in 1.75% to 2% area and Doyle, maybe do you want elaborate on why it\u2019s not a precise number?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, it\u2019s not a precise number because you got to make some assumptions, particularly about how we allocate the qualitative portion of the reserve and for us the qualitative portion is a pretty significant component of the overall reserves, something on the order of about 30% of the total. But if you\u2019re thinking 1.75 to 1.8, maybe a bit more, that\u2019s probably the right area. And that takes into account something about the qualitative addition of $25 million roughly that we mentioned in the press release, specifically related to energy.", "Steve Moss", "Okay and then in terms of the -- you're looking the portfolio today versus stay back \u201808, \u201909. Is there any structural difference? Do you more service loans in the portfolio today versus backbench? Just kind of wondering what are the key differences. I know you mentioned gas before?", "Scott McLean", "I would say it\u2019s fundamentally -- this is Scott McLean. It\u2019s fundamentally the same mix. We may actually have a little more of midstream today than we did then, but it\u2019s fundamentally the same mix.", "Harris Simmons", "Do you want to talk about junior liens back then versus maybe today?", "Scott McLean", "Yes, back then we had -- we maybe had three or four junior liens in the portfolio, going into the \u201808, \u201809 downturn. I would say we probably have four or five they were small. And we have zero today. And we also, back -- going into that downturn, we had a few more, not many, but we had a few loans where there were large unsecured pieces behind us, senior unsecured that were issued in the public market or large junior subordinated pieces, where total leverage was higher and many of those worked just fine, but some did not. And so really some of the most important part of lessons learned coming out of the downturn were changes we made to not do any second lien financing and to generally avoid situations where total leverage is well beyond the bank senior borrowing base piece.", "Harris Simmons", "And one other change that will be applicable to the end of the industry as a whole Scott is that people in 2007 and \u201808 or \u201806, \u201807 year were drilling for dry gas only. Everything is much more balanced now, for better or for worse, but you\u2019re getting some of each.", "Scott McLean", "Yes, I would say then if you looked at the entire portfolio, it was probably 60% gas in terms of the borrowing base collateral, 40% oil and you\u2019ll recall the word pivot was used significantly following that. People were pivoting away from gas and they pivoted to oil. You\u2019ll now start reading about people pivoting back away from oil ever so slightly.", "Harris Simmons", "And for those you didn\u2019t follow that area, there was -- because gas did just well over $8 close to $9, I think per MCF and it fell down into the $2.5 to $4 range.", "Scott McLean", "It\u2019s stayed there.", "Harris Simmons", "It stayed in that range. So that\u2019s different in the production mix.", "Steve Moss", "Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess one last question in terms of that price of credit. Are we seeing now, given that you\u2019re going to add to provision reserves going forward, has loan loss reserve bottomed here?", "Harris Simmons", "You mean the total dollars in reserve? I don\u2019t want to go precisely, because the provision may or may not fully cover charge-offs in any given quarter, but I think the year -- as we said all year last year, that the year of substantial reserve releases or negative provisions has probably come to an end for the time being.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "I wanted to actually start on capital, looking at where you ended year, 12% tier one common. You obviously have a ton of capital. With that said you just raised common and now you\u2019re talking about quite a few certainties in the energy book. Is it too soon for you to consider asking for even a modest return of capital in the upcoming CCAR beyond, I don\u2019t know, maybe a token dividend increase?", "Scott McLean", "Well Steve the upcoming CCAR was already submitted. So whatever we submitted, we submitted. And I don\u2019t think we want to comment on what we submitted till we get the -- until [indiscernible] comes out of Washington. But I think -- I will note that we did -- we have said consistently that we\u2019re likely to remain somewhat cautious in doing major capital changes or asking for too much, given the closeness on the resubmission last year. We\u2019d like to get one more good read on how -- not only how we assess our risk --we think we\u2019re doing a very good job there -- but also how the federal reserve kind of assesses our risk. But we would agree with you. We\u2019ve got really strong capital ratios, both tier one common and also other -- when you add other tier one in, we\u2019ve got among the strong -- probably the strongest capital ratio of any CCAR institution down there and certainly in a bank like one.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "That\u2019s fair. Maybe to follow up, of the $3 billion, the energy exposure that you outlined, just to slice it a different way; what\u2019s the split between share national credit participations for larger energy companies and direct loans to smaller companies?", "Scott McLean", "Well the exact percentage I need to get for you. On the reserve base side, it\u2019s a much higher degree of shared national credits, because those credits are larger. We generally do not participate -- we don\u2019t originate a lot of $5 million and $10 million reserve base loans, because the collateral pools are generally much more limited and they are higher risk because of that. So generally speaking, the transactions ran on a reserve base side or anywhere from $20 million $25 million up to hundreds of millions of dollars, syndicated transactions. So the percentage though would be pretty significant, because the dollar amounts are larger. And the folks that we\u2019re participating with, when we don\u2019t lead, we lead about 25% of the time plus or minus where we are considered to lead. The rest of the time, we are with a small number of highly experienced underwriters, that you would know them if I named them. And it\u2019s not -- there\u2019s not 10 of them. There\u2019s about four or five that we work with. And so in that sense, we think that gives us strength.", "On the energy services side, the percentage of syndicated transactions there would be much lower. And although -- you do a see a lot of club financing that goes on there. Even for $20 million and $30 million transactions you\u2019ll see -- it\u2019s not unusual to see two banks in a $20 million to $30 million deal as a risk mitigation tool.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "And do you just have the dollars of shared national credits that are in the energy sector? Just what that balance is?", "Doyle Arnold", "Yes we might be able to get that for you, while we\u2019re on the call, but I would -- I can't quote it off the top of my head.", "Harris Simmons", "It\u2019s not -- we\u2019ll try to get back you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank.", "Dave Rochester", "Just on credit again. I was wondering, if there were any other reserve impacts on the energy book this quarter other than that $25 million qualitative adjustment? And then given your comment on the potential for downgrades to come from the rebalancing, should we expect that rebalancing is going to be fully reflected in the reserve by the end of 2Q, would you think?", "Harris Simmons", "Well two parts to the question. As we mentioned in the press release, we did attempt to look at the portfolio, the actual credits during the quarter and even into late December. Difficult to do a full re-underwriting and certainly not a full reengineering of the reserves and what not, but on that -- based on that, there were a few downgrades, a couple to criticize our classified status and a few more still within a pass grade, but a lower pass grade. That did have some impact on the reserve, maybe just a few million dollars, but not -- the bigger part was the qualitative adjustment we made, because based on various sensitivity analysis, we became convinced that there very likely were incurred losses there that just we couldn\u2019t fully figure it out by the end of the quarter in terms of a traditional analysis, that what we think -- which we think will show up.", "One possible pattern over the course of the year is that there will be some shift from the qualitative into the quantitative part of the reserve, as we get financial information from the borrowers. But the -- that process won\u2019t be complete certainly by the end of Q1. We\u2019d probably get the first real financials that began to show an impact sometime in Q3 -- Q2 and I would expect even if prices don\u2019t move at all, we\u2019ll -- we won\u2019t have fully kind of seen the impact until maybe Q3-Q4. But again there may be some, there potentially will be some downgrades, but some of this will be absorbed potentially by a shift from the qualitative into the quantitative portion of the reserve. We just don't know yet.", "Dave Rochester", "And what level of oil prices do you use for your rebalancing analysis? Are you using some kind of three month average, or how do you project those out as a factor in that rebalancing? ", "Harris Simmons", "We use the -- basically the NYMEX strip and so\u2026", "Scott McLean", "Which is a WTI West Texas Intermediate crude forward price curve.", "Harris Simmons", "Right. And so the current price that you see is you have to look at the forward curve to really see how we evaluate it, because the production obviously takes place, depending on the reserves over a three month to 15 year basis. ", "Scott McLean", "That curve today would start with -- today\u2019s spot price and then it gradually gets up into the 50s over the next couple of years.", "Harris Simmons", "That's correct. And I think the other thing that's important to know is that when you look at historical oil prices as an example; when the price of oil was a 140 in early 2008, our borrowing base -- our price deck was in the sort of low 80 range; and if you look at the underwriting we were doing throughout 2010, '11 and '12, our price deck was generally in the $70 to $80 range. So that's important to know. It's -- we never used a price deck that was $90 or a $100, even when the price was there. ", "Dave Rochester", "And just one last one. You had mentioned you're expecting loan growth in 2015, generally in line with what you had in 2014, that Texas would be slower. We're just wondering, are you assuming a flat energy book or some run-off there? ", "Harris Simmons", "Some run-off there. There's definitely some. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. ", "Ken Zerbe", "Along the same lines, I guess as the last question. In terms of the indirect impact of low oil on the entire Amegy book, what's the likelihood that you see such a contraction in CapEx, in drilling and it just has a carryover effect on jobs, on sort of all the ancillary businesses in the broader Texas economy, that you end up seeing a fairly meaningful decline in your total Amegy loan portfolio? ", "Harris Simmons", "Let me -- why don\u2019t I take that also. It's a logical question to ask about sort of the ripple effects of all this, and I think the most important thing to start with is that the real estate exposure in the Texas Bank was about $3.6 billion in outstanding's in 2008. At the end of 2014 it was $2.4 billion. So the exposure to land A and B was $989 million in 2008. It's a $149 million today. So our total real estate exposure is significantly less, our land exposure is almost negligible. And so real-estate is the natural place where oil and gas price volatility turns when it has a ripple effect.", "The other comment I would make to you -- I'm not about to try to explain to you that the Houston economy and Texas will be immune to this. There will absolutely be an impact on those economies. But there is one secular change that will be a strength for Houston and Texas this time around, compared to '08, '09 and any other period of decline, and that is the benefit of low natural gas prices. There -- if you look at the announcements that have been made for major petrochemical expansions all along the Houston ship channel, it is billions and billions of dollars of construction that is all based on natural gas prices remaining low, which I think most people generally believe they will. So that is driving -- is one of the drivers of the economy there right now and will certainly cushion from this oil price volatility we're seeing today. ", "Ken Zerbe", "Okay. And then just one other question. In terms of -- I guess if we look a year from now right, I now understand you built qualitative reserves on energy. Barring $10 a barrel oil, where could you be wrong? Where could we end up 12 months from now with meaningfully higher losses on the energy portfolio? What would be the drivers of that? ", "Scott McLean", "Well I would say that -- well first of all, it's impossible to know, but secondly it's going to have to be an 18 to 36 month period I think for losses that would exceed our historical experience. The losses we've had historically have been modest relative to the corporate charge-off ratio and our capital. They're almost negligible. And you would have to have 24 to 36 months of extended decline. Because again remember most borrowing bases are generally 50% to 60% gas and some are -- many are 60% oil, okay. But there is always a balance, almost always a balance of some kind. And so we\u2019ve been in an extended period of low gas prices. So when you think about our exposure, you need to think about kind of 50% to 60% of the portfolio that is really being exposed to this volatility, because the part that's going to expose the gas has been living with a low gas price for a long time.", "Doyle Arnold", "I think I would add that a $25 million qualitative addition to the reserve is kind of under an accounting or GAAP incurred loss model, what we could reasonably assert is appropriate today. If this goes on for -- as Scott said, for an extended period of time, a couple of years, three years, where oil prices remain very low, there will almost undoubtedly, based on our sensitivity analysis be some additional increments to the provision related to that, and some [indiscernible] classified -- more criticized and classified loans and it will begin to shift again toward the quantitative side is as we -- as Warren Buffett once said, when the time goes out, we see who has been swimming without a bathing suit in the portfolio, and the few of those will show up over time. But bear in mind that even several times that $25 million spread out over a couple of years would equate to 10 to 15 basis points of charge-offs on the reserve -- on the portfolio as a whole on an annualized basis.", "Harris Simmons", "On an annualized basis. And other thing just to keep in mind is that this is 8% of the portfolio. So there is 92% of the portfolio that stands to benefit in some fashion, particularly in the California markets and so forth that have real estate exposure with 10 year treasury where it is. That will support the valuations of those properties quite nicely. I think we need to move to the next question. Thanks Ken, really appreciate your. ", "James Abbott", "I think we\u2019re going to let us to a one question and may be one quick follow-up. We have quite a few people still waiting and we'd like to try to give everybody at least one shot.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Jennifer Demba ", "A question on energy for Scott. Scott, in terms of the shared -- the energy shared national credits that you have where you are not an agent, what is your leeway in terms of operating those credits more adversely than an agent would or sooner [indiscernible] if at all?", "Scott McLean", "Jennifer, thank you and let me -- as I answer that, I want to punctuate one of the questions that was asked earlier. I didn\u2019t know off the top of my head the percentages, but we did in fact have it right here. So the percentage of shared national credits in the upstream portfolio, the reserve based portfolio is 80%. I said it was a large percentage, and it in fact is. In the midstream portfolio, it's 85% shared national credit. Those are always very large transactions. And in the oilfield service sector it's 50% shared national credits. And to answer your question\u2026", "Harris Simmons", "And those are both, ones we lead and ones we participate. That\u2019s a whole thing.", "Scott McLean", "Yes. And to answer your question, generally speaking on shared national credits, we are right in sync with where the agent is if we\u2019re not the agent and as I said, it is really important to understand that the number of agents we deal with is very small. So we\u2019re not being exposed to just the random experience of random players in the market and there are a lot of those that do not have the experience that we have or these other major underwriters have. The other thing I would comment on is that as you know annually the -- our regulators review all shared national credits, and rarely do we have a difference in grade from what the regulators would have thought or the agent would have thought. So it just -- it doesn\u2019t really happen that often.", " Operator", "The next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford ", "I'll actually start with my quick follow-up, and that would just be on the energy portfolio. You did see little over $200 million of growth and nearly 4% in the quarter. Too much of that was just draws on existing lines or perhaps some growth you wouldn\u2019t -- you\u2019d rather not see and do you expect much more of that as the year progresses?", "Scott McLean", "I would be speculating to a certain degree, but generally speaking I would say it was probably more related to draws, because the fourth quarter for many energy services companies was one of the strongest quarters in their recent history; and secondly for reserve based companies, most of our reserve base clients had very robust drilling budgets in 2014, and generally in the industry, they are drilling hard in the fourth quarter to drill up the budgets that they have. So, I would guess its more utilization than absolute new transactions.", "Doyle Arnold", "Joe, we -- on page three of the release, we kind of give you a breakdown of that. You can see in the table that total commitments increased 224 million. The unfunded portion or unused portion increased $100 million. So the funding has increased a bit disproportionately there.", "Joe Morford ", "The other quick question was just on -- longer term on the efficiency ratio and depending on how you want to back out certain non-recurring stuff, you'd come in with say a level around 70% currently. And where do you see that going longer term, particularly as you finish -- complete the system\u2019s conversion and perhaps see a little higher rate environment too?", "Harris Simmons", "Yes. This is Harris. I'll take that Joe. There are obviously a variety of factors that go into that, some of which are in the denominator in the revenue piece, the most significant of which is the asset sensitivity we have, and that contributes -- roughly as I look at kind of the size of some of our peer\u2019s MBS portfolios, over 5 percentage points to the ratio. My expectation is that we get this down into the low 60s if you adjust for that piece of it. So in a little more normal rate environment I think that\u2019s achievable. And ultimately I would hope that we can drive it beyond that, but I think we\u2019re going to have to get through these systems projects to do that. The systems projects -- in 2015 we expect will contribute about $37 million in incremental spend.", "Scott McLean", "Compared to about $26 million.", "Harris Simmons", "Compared to about $26 million in 2014, so that still -- that's the way on it. But if I adjust for that, and if I adjust for the asset sensitivity, my expectation is that we get it down into kind of the low 60s.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin", "Just a follow up on expenses and things you can control. So I wanted to just ask, as you think about that absolute dollar increase that you just mentioned this year; A, do you have a better line of sight though? Could we start getting it below this 405 - 410 as you think about next year? And underneath that, my follow up would just be, unfortunately we\u2019re going to lose this benefit that we have had from provision this year. So anything else that you guys are thinking about as far as underlying rationalization? I know you guys had talked a little bit about [indiscernible] et cetera. So just in terms of what you can control, any updated thoughts on when you can see that cascading, and other programs that you might be thinking about? ", "Harris Simmons", "Sure. Well, we are actually looking at every line item in the expense portion of the P&L, and have in fact taken some steps that will -- I would expect will offset certainly the incremental increase in the project spend this coming year. But they are in areas like travel and entertainment and some of the consulting expenses, et cetera, et cetera.", "Going out a little further, we know that there are going to be some opportunities that come to us as we complete some of these systems projects that will allow us to consolidate some of the back office functions that have not been possible to consolidate until we get through some of the systems work. And I\u2019d be getting the cart the before the horse to start to put numbers to those. But I would expect that during this year we\u2019ll be giving you a little more information about some of the targets we have.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brad Milsaps from Sandler O'Neill.", "Brad Milsaps", "Doyle, I know you guys call in the release that deposit growth is typically really strong in the fourth quarter. This quarter looked maybe even stronger than it has been for the last couple of years. Anything in particular driving that aside from seasonality, and how does that did and/or do you expect a lot of it to exit maybe the first part of the year? Just trying to get a better sense of balance sheet size and how you\u2019re thinking about managing liquidity?", "Doyle Arnold", "That growth was -- you're correct. It was a bit stronger even than the usual seasonal strength. And I don\u2019t think there is any one major thing that we can point to. It was fairly wide spread and kind of looks like for whatever reason customers wanting to show lots of liquidity on their balance sheet going into year end. We do expect some of that to probably run off. The growth was so strong, I'm not sure where we\u2019ll end up, but as people -- we usually see another uptick right around the first few weeks in April, as people start building balances for the estimated tax payments and then it comes down. But that one was hard to figure. And it did drive the overall size of the whole balance sheet this quarter.", "Brad Milsaps", "Sure. And just a follow up. I know you talk about the CMO purchase. With rates where they are, are you -- would you back off some of that and stick with just keeping it very, very liquid in short term or what are your thoughts there?", "Doyle Arnold", "Well, we don\u2019t really know. We have been -- if you look at the amount of cash we have and the rate at which we\u2019ve been buying, it would take quite a while to convert all of that cash into -- I would say not CMOs, it\u2019s RMBS really; and part of agency and relatively pointed out, if you kind of look at the map, we\u2019re trying to keep the duration, even of what we\u2019re buying relatively short as RMBS securities go so as not to give up too much of the asset sensitivity too quick. But we haven\u2019t decided how long and how to continue that program, but at the moment it is ongoing.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Good afternoon guys. It\u2019s actually Thomas on for Paul. One quick question. On your sort of guidance that margin may sort of stay flat, mostly driven by reduced debt cost going forward, are there any -- we cover a couple of other companies that are sort of baking in an assumption for higher rates in the back half of \u201815. Is there any assumption on the asset side there?", "Doyle Arnold", "No, we did not. We did not try to forecast the rise in rates in the later part of the year. If that occurs, it\u2019s probably a benefit to the margin that\u2019s outside the guidance.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful.", "Doyle Arnold", "That addressed what you said? Okay.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Yes, exactly that\u2019s all. I'll let someone else out there.", "Doyle Arnold", "Again, I think we need to clarify. We actually do expect net interest income to increase during 2015. So we didn\u2019t say flat. We do --", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Well right, but margin would be stable and then you'd get a pick in net interest income from --", "Doyle Arnold", "Right, from loan growth.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Yes, exactly.", "Doyle Arnold", "The securities purchases, yes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kevin Barker from Compass Point.", "Kevin Barker ", "I was hoping you can expand upon some of the comments you made in December regarding potential reduction of preferred stock or in order to reduce the capital intensity on your balance sheet.", "Scott McLean", "I think for the time being I will just note that going into 2014 we had a pretty high level of debt and we took actions to reduce that. Going into \u201815 we had probably the third highest, maybe fourth -- pretty close there, Tier 1 common ratio among the bank wide CCAR institutions and when you add preferred and non-common tier 1, we're by a margin the highest. So over time we\u2019ll be looking at that preferred stock layer. That is subject to CCAR and unlike arguably senior debt, maybe a little more flexibility there. So I\u2019ll just leave it at we have more pure on common tier 1 [ph] than relative to our size in any other institution like us and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll be taking a look at.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott ", "In terms of the $25 million oil field on energy, I know you mentioned your constrained by GAAP accounting, that you're having some sensitivities and came off with that number. Could you give us a bit more detail on how you've reached the $25 million and why is $25 million, why it's not $50 million, why it's not $10 million? How are you kind of able to hold in on a particular number there?", "Scott McLean", "Well, if there were that much science, it probably wouldn\u2019t be qualitative. It would be in the quantitative part of the reserve.", "Geoffrey Elliott ", "Maybe [indiscernible], why can you do 25, thus you can't give a bigger number because the accountants wouldn\u2019t be happy with it. What are they looking at?", "Scott McLean", "We look at a variety of things. We did look at kind of individual credits, we did. We ran some kind of high level sensitivities on the portfolio; what if energy prices stayed down at this level for a very extended period of time. But that\u2019s kind of getting at -- that begins to shade into an expected loss thing as I mentioned.", "Going back to an earlier question about capital and what not, I would just note, we stressed the energy portfolio pretty hard in our CCAR submission. It just happens that we decided back in late September to use shock oil down to $50 a barrel in our CCAR submission and we shocked the mining employment, which was another driver of our models pretty hard. So we have the benefit of being able to look at kind of in the CCAR what might those -- the energy component of the overall highly stressed losses be if they extended for a very long period of time.", "But again under GAAP you can\u2019t do expected loss. You have to do incurred loss and almost by definition. That is something less than expected loss, projecting future economic conditions. And so at the end of the day it does become judgmental. It is a qualitative portion. It\u2019s not quantitative. So what we\u2019ve booked in the reserve is less than what might eventually happen if, if, if, if, if, and -- but it\u2019s what we felt was reasonable, prudent under an incurred loss accounting structure today.", "Harris Simmons", "And it does -- there is some framework around even how we did the qualitative piece.", "Scott McLean", "Yes.", "Harris Simmons", "So we have some factors that we adjusted and this is what falls out of it.", "Scott McLean", "Yes, there is a whole list of criteria that we utilized in the qualitative assessment that drive a quantitative outcome in terms of creating a qualitative number, but it\u2019s -- but there is a great deal of judgment that goes into that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining-Sparks.", "Marty Mosby", "Just a quick follow-up too. You talked about the expense increase of about $37 million from the overall systems conversions and the back office technology. Qualitatively how has the project being going, and just was curious, are you hitting your milestones or what surprises you might have run into so far?", "Harris Simmons", "We completed accounting -- chart of accounts conversion on time and slightly under budget just last weekend and our controller is standing up and walking around the table taking a victory lap as we tell you this, but I\u2019ll let -- the other projects are proceeding reasonable well. Scott do you want to?", "Scott McLean", "Sure, and first let me just clarify, and Harris noted it, but the $37 million estimate he referenced for 2015, incremental spending on these projects would compare to about $24 million to $25 million in 2014. So it\u2019s an increase there, not an absolute number.", "Harris Simmons", "We use the term incremental a little differently than people on the phone might be. So we\u2019re talking -- these are expenses that are outside of our normal employee -- that we're spending on consulting services and other processes.", "Scott McLean", "So we have a lot of internal employees who are working would otherwise be doing other kinds of project work, who have been assigned to this task. And so the incremental amount we\u2019re talking about is incremental to kind of the normal run rate for those internal employees.", "Harris Simmons", "And maybe said just a little differently or to add to that, just in terms of absolute dollar amounts, about $14 million was spent in the fourth quarter, all in on the systems and we expect the spend at similar amount throughout 2015 quarter by quarter. There is some fluctuation obviously but that\u2019s about the amount.", "Marty Mosby", "And then just qualitatively about progress, on the other systems outside accounting?", "Harris Simmons", "It\u2019s not that.", "Scott McLean", "So again the chart of the gas project was right on time. The original date was that we would convert on January 20th, and that\u2019s when we converted. There are several other phases to that, but that was the most significant credit lead, which we were [indiscernible] for our frontend loan underwriting origination system, all the way to the backend has been implemented in our Arizona and Nevada subsidiaries, and will be implemented in Colorado in the next 30 days; and Amegy in the early spring with California and Zions First National Bank following in the summer, early fall. So it is right on track and it\u2019s very much living up to the expectations that we had hoped. So that\u2019s going well.", "And our enterprise loan operations initiative, which is basically converting from 15 different loan operations sites, that used multiple different incidences of our free loan systems, they will be converting to two loan operations centers, fundamentally using the same instances of the loan centers over time -- the loan systems over time. And that is underway and on track, and that will be completed by the end of this year for the most part. But the majority of it will be completely by the mid to late fall. So it\u2019s progressing very nicely.", "And the big core operating systems, there are three releases. The first release is our retail loan system. It comes in the second quarter of \u201916. The second release is our commercial loan portion of that system. It will come in 2017, early \u201917. And then the deposits portion of the system will come in 2018, early in the year. But it\u2019s all going well and we\u2019re actively working on as well the efficiencies and cost savings that we anticipate from this significant simplification of our back office.", "James Abbott", "Okay and I think we\u2019ll take our last question here.", "Operator", "The final question comes from John Moran from Macquarie.", "John Moran", "Just a quick on construction and land development, I just noticed that the balances were up in the quarter. And after obviously last quarter you guys had taken some moves to kind of to mitigate risk. With CCAR submitted, is there more willingness, ability, desire to kind of grow that book, or is this quarter kind of one-off? And then maybe an update on -- I know that you were working on some syndication capability there. If you have any update there?", "Scott McLean", "The growth on balances this quarter is a result of commitments made some quarters ago. They don\u2019t just happen. We took a lot of action to reduce commitments in the second and third quarters last year. The concentration limits that we've put in place will allow only very modest growth in that category of loan going forward. It was not -- it was a won and done in the sense of just a major reduction from where we were. It was not -- but ongoing to have growth -- it's not going to snap right back. It was not just a get it down for September 30th and then only-only income free do whatever you want. It will be constrained to a lower level of growth going forward.", "Harris Simmons", "I\u2019ll just note it's about 5% of total loans, and that\u2019s less in a quarter or what it was at peak. And it\u2019s not going anywhere close to even halfway where it was at the peak. There\u2019s some room for a little bit of growth there, but it\u2019s going to be reasonably constrained.", "James Abbott", "Okay. Thank you very much for all of your questions today. We appreciate them and hopefully this has been helpful for you. I\u2019ll be available to take questions or follow up questions throughout the week. And I will see you at our conference sometime soon in this quarter. Thanks so much.", "Harris Simmons", "Thank you all very much.", "Scott McLean", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference for today.

This call is being recorded. I will now turn the time over to James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.", "James Richard Abbott - SVP-Investor Relations & External Communications", "Thank you, Sayyed, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our first quarter 2015 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Scott McLean, President.", "I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "A copy of the full earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During that Q&A section, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up related question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks very much, James, and I want to welcome all of you to the call today. Results for the first quarter 2015 were I think generally in line with our expectations and also those of, I think, most of the analyst community. Credit costs and operational expenses were somewhat better than expected, while revenue and loan growth experienced softer performance than were expected.", "I want to turn right to the energy lending for just a moment and highlight how we've been managing that portfolio. It's probably the business that many of you are focused on right now. In the late fall, we were early to initiate the process of reviewing our energy loans and reaching out to all of our energy-related clients. We've completed the borrowing base redetermination of about one-fifth of our portfolio of exploration and production credits. We found that on a weighted average basis, the borrowing base declined by about 12%. A few experienced an increase in the borrowing base due to factors such as the development of additional reserves, while most experienced declines as one with generally expect after a sharp reduction in the commodity price.", "We downgraded several credits and we know of several cases where we've reduced our loan grade before others and a bank syndicate have reduced the grades of the same loans, and therefore our results of classified energy credits may not be comparable to peers until later in the cycle.", "Most of the energy credits are held at our affiliate, Amegy Bank and as mentioned in the release, we have added significantly to Amegy's allowance for credit losses in the last two quarters. As I mentioned in the earnings release, we are very encouraged with the response from the energy industry. Active oil drilling rigs have declined by 53% in the last six months and there's been a significant amount of capital raised by the industry, including both public and private equity offerings as well as subordinated debt, which has resulted in reduced senior bank lines of credit.", "Many of our energy services clients have aggressively cut costs and are rightsizing their businesses with the current operating environment. Several private equity sponsors have raised additional capital that will be used to support existing portfolio companies by either reducing leverage and/or taking market share.", "On a macro level, the rate of oil inventory that's been building very quickly maybe showing early signs of moderating, which is likely a factor in oil prices increasing in the last few days. We expected as the borrowing base redetermination process is completed in the next few weeks, we're likely to experience further downgrades. This shouldn't come as a surprise as we've been highlighting this since early December. In the prior cycle, our historical losses on energy credits were very modest with an annual peak loss of about 1% despite a classified energy loans ratio of approximately 20% of total energy loans.", "We talk about expenses just for a moment before I turn the time over to Doyle Arnold. We're highly focused on expense control and we're very pleased with that performance in the first quarter coming in low our own budget and I think below most estimates. As technology advances, we expect to be able to reduce certain labor-intensive tasks, primarily in the back office, but also in the way customers interact with us such as through mobile banking. We're still fine-tuning our outlook for cost savings that should come from the initiative to overhaul and upgrade our technology systems and expect to provide you with an outlook within the next two to three months. We're still comfortable with our outlook of approximately $1.6 billion annually and kind of core operating expenses and continue to look aggressively for redundancies or ways to improve efficiency within our system.", "Finally, as many of you are aware, we recently announced both the retirement of Doyle Arnold, our Chief Financial Officer and Vice Chairman, and the hiring of Paul Burdiss, who will be taking over the role of CFO. And I just want to take a moment and with all of you on the line to express my appreciation to Doyle for an enormous amount of hard work and a lot of thoughtful action and support over the last nearly 15 years. He's been a great part of the team and a great friend, and we're really going to miss Doyle and wish him the very best as he works on his golf game among other things, needs a lot of work.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Need to work.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And at the same time, I really want to welcome Paul Burdiss. I think most of you know, Paul came most recently from SunTrust and before that, from Comerica, in a treasurer role at both institutions and also with an Investor Relations role at Comerica, and brings a lot of very strong skills and experience to the company, and we're really looking forward to working with Paul and welcome him to our team.", "So, with that, I'll \u2013 I'm going to turn the call over to Doyle. Doyle's going to stay on as CFO through the filing of the 10-Q, as I think most of you know, and then we'll turn that role over to Paul. But as said, this will be Doyle's siren song. And so, Doyle, go ahead.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Harris. I think I want to remind you that nobody wants a CFO with a low golf handicap. So I hope you think the weakness in my golf game was offset by the \u2013 my strength as the CFO.", "Okay. Overview, let's see. Where's the \u2013 yeah, here we go. So, as noted in the press release, the net income available to common for the first quarter was $75.3 million or $0.37 per diluted common share. This is up from $66.8 million or $0.33 per diluted common share last quarter. The largest positive driver for the increased earnings was non-interest expense, which improved by $25 million to $398 million from $423 million prior quarter.", "Reduced costs related to our CCAR submission for various consultants and whatnot was this biggest single driver, and I would say the fourth quarter numbers were probably artificially high because of making sure that we accrued for everything that was out there in that quarter. This one maybe a little bit on the low side but we hope to do closer to the $400 million number than the $423 million and think we will in future quarters.", "Other significant positive difference in the first quarter compared to the fourth was provision expense, which decreased $13 million; basically back to a net zero first quarter. The change in provision was due to a few large recoveries in the quarter, in total about $20 million higher than the recent rate of recoveries. If not for the large recoveries, we would have experienced a positive provision in the first quarter because, as we'll talk about later, we actually did increase the allowance in the first quarter. Because we do not expect recoveries to remain that strong in future quarters, we remain comfortable with our guidance for a modestly positive provision expense for 2015.", "I'll move on now to a brief review of the some key revenue drivers. Turning first to net interest income, under loan category, average loans held for investment increased $333 million compared to the prior quarter, while period end loan balances increased $116 million. As we noted on our last earnings call, we did not see a sharp late fourth quarter increase in loans last year, which had been a pattern that we've seen for several years. And by the same token that the first few weeks of the new year did not see a reversal of that \u2013 of a run-up, we didn't have a sharp seasonal runoff that we've seen in some recent prior years. So the pattern was a little more smooth around the year-end this year.", "We reduced some energy services loans primarily as a result of additional capital raised by participants in that sector, and this reduction was a contributor to the slower first quarter loan growth. Additional risk-reduction efforts and limiting commercial real estate commitment growth and the continued runoff of loans from our national real estate group resulted in softer loan growth than we might experience if not for active risk-management efforts.", "Our line managers are reporting general strength within pipelines, although prepayment rates also remain high due to a variety of reasons and as such, we expect loan growth to be moderate in 2015 as we expect to see softness in loan growth in Texas and improving strength in some of the other economies within our footprint.", "Net interest income for the first quarter on page 10, you'll see that total net interest income was $417 million, a decline of about $13 million from the prior quarter, but essentially unchanged from the year-ago period. Much of the linked quarter decline is attributable to a decrease in the day count between the fourth and the first quarters, accounting for about $9 million of the $13 million.", "The remainder of the decline is largely attributable to a decline in loan income, which was partially offset by a sequential quarter increase in interest income from securities and we expect to continue growth in interest income from building the medium duration agency MBS of that portfolio as we've discussed with you previously and in various IR meetings and conferences.", "Turning to the net interest margin and loan pricing. Compared to the prior quarter, the NIM decreased 3 basis points to 3.22%. The minor decline is primarily due to continued pressure on loan yields, which you'll see on the average balance sheet on page 14 where loan yields declined 10 basis points compared to the prior quarter.", "Principal causes of declining loan yields are the re-pricing of new loans at lower rates than the loans that are maturing or prepaying and, to a lesser degree, fewer fees that were amortized through the interest income line such as prepayment penalty income. New loan pricing was generally stable with the prior quarter with a weighted average coupon of 3.65%.", "Looking at the components of the portfolio, C&I and owner-occupied loan production accounted for more than 60% of loan production and within that, we do see and are hearing (13:15) of increased price pressure in the last six months on the smaller loans which had been fairly stable previously.", "Pricing on larger loans has been in a fairly tight range and appears to be stable by most reports across our footprint. Nevertheless, the gap between the coupon on total new loan production in the overall book of business is about 25 basis points. This gap is consistent with the gap over the past several quarters; it's not widened or narrowed appreciably.", "If competitive pricing holds and there's no shift in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, we would expect some further NIM pressure from the effects I just described on the loan portfolio. However, we expect the net interest income to actually increase slightly over the next year as the pressures from loan pricing should be more than offset by further moderate loan growth, continued purchases of residential MBS and the reduction of high-cost debt that is maturing in the second half of 2015.", "Turning to fee income, there was a 6% decline from the fourth quarter, this was primarily due to the fourth quarter recognition of \u2013 as we talked about on the last call, of unrealized gains on some small business investment company, or SBIC investments, that were held on a couple different places and they appeared for accounting reasons on two different lines both dividends and other investment income and in the equity securities gains line.", "Normalizing for this effect, there was a modest decline of service charges attributable to two factors: first, there are seasonal factors such as non-sufficient fund charges, which are generally weaker in the first quarter and lower loan origination fees due to seasonally lighter origination volume in the first quarter; second, because of lower fees on unfunded loan commitments.", "Fee income remains a major initiative for us, we've talked about for a while now. And we've added increased discipline to help further increase this source of revenue. But I think you've heard this from others and you're aware that driving growth in fee income is definitely a challenge in this environment.", "Turning now non-interest expense, the decline in NIE to $397 million from $423 million in the prior quarter reflects a drop in various costs, some of which, as I mentioned, is due to CCAR-related expenses. There was also a large legal accrual in the fourth quarter that came after our initial earnings release, but before we filed the 10-Q. But other declines are due to concerted effort across the company to reduce cost, as Harris mentioned earlier.", "The three major line items, I'll discuss here and then I'm sure you'll have additional questions later. First, salaries and benefits increased by about $5 million from the prior quarter. This increase is primarily a result of the seasonal increase in employee benefits related to Social Security taxes and Federal unemployment tax.", "Second item is professional and legal services, decreased $15 million from the fourth quarter. Again, mainly due to a seasonal decrease in consulting expenses related to the company's CCAR process. We expect this item to be lower for the full-year 2015, compared with the full-year 2014, partially due to the CCAR 2016 submission schedule being pushed back by a quarter. But also because we don't believe we'll need to spend comparable amounts in the future now that a lot of our CCAR infrastructure is more developed and in place. So we hope more incremental improvement from here on rather than major builds from scratch. We'll continue to employ outside consultants to some degree, however, working on the technology projects for a continued period or a considerable period.", "Turning to the technology initiatives. Progress on these initiatives has been very good. We remain within our announced implementation timeframe of five years to seven years and are still on the projected path to come in line with the previously disclosed $300 million area of total expenses for these projects, which includes both internal labor and external or incremental costs, but does not net any potential cost savings. So that's the kind of the gross spend labor level.", "With regard to external labor or so-called incremental costs, we expect that number to be approximately $30 million to $35 million per year through 2018 and then tapering-off thereafter. We do expect to realize cost savings along the way, which we expect to announce \u2013 we'll start to announce some of those over the next two months or three months. Such savings should reduce the impact to the income statement from the gross cost of the technology initiatives; and those initiatives, I remind you are \u2013 we think are critical to our long-term efforts to control and reduce expenses relative to assets and revenue.", "Finally, the other non-interest expense line. There was a significant change to $58 million from $75 million in the last quarter. I already mentioned a large legal accrual during the quarter. That was a one-time event that increased those costs. But in addition to that, we've been successful at reducing a number of smaller line items, PR, travel, and whatnot, that get rolled into that line as part of the expense control efforts. Cutting through all of that, we expect that this other non-interest expense line will range between kind of in the $60 million to low-$60 million area in the near term per quarter, best estimate now.", "A few comments on the balance sheet. Page nine. The growth in the balance sheet's largely driven by deposits, which continued to grow in the first quarter by $275 million. However, on the asset side, money market investments declined by more than $250 million, while securities increased $550 million approximately.", "Most of the securities growth was in Ginnie 5/1 ARMs and Fannie 10-year fully amortizing residential MBS, with a duration of a bit over three years; and we think given their term, limited duration extension risk. This is consistent with the purchases we've made in the previous couple of quarters in which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future as we deploy cash incrementally into HQLA-type securities.", "Over time, these purchases will moderately reduce the natural asset sensitivity of the company, but we will expect it will still be one of the more asset-sensitive banks within the industry due to our duration profile.", "As most of you are aware, as I mentioned, these securities qualify as high-quality liquid assets. So there's no change in going from cash to them in our LCR calculations. And as it pertains to liquidity coverage ratio, we calculate that we're already in excess of the required 100% ratio under the modified LCR rules that apply to banks of our size. We also expect that the addition of the longer duration assets should enhance our stress test results by boosting pre-tax \u2013 our pre-provision net revenue in an environment where generally the severe adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve has interest rates falling by more than 50%.", "Also, as noted in the release, we moved the remainder of the CDOs that we hold from held-to-maturity to AFS, the remainder of those who weren't already AFS that is, which increases our flexibility in managing that portfolio going forward.", "Turning to comments on the credit quality, Harris already elaborated on the energy credit portfolio. I'll just comment that most credit trends outside of energy continue to look very good. It's notable that OREO has fallen to only $17 million from a high of $414 million in 2010. Although, non-accruals increased somewhat and may increase somewhat further, I would say maybe \u2013 probably will increase somewhat further as the energy credit situation plays out. At present, there's still less than 1% of loans and real estate owned, and most of those are still current on payments.", "With regard to energy loans, in addition to the reserve that was already in place for such credits, we've increased the allowance for credit losses at Amegy Bank by $55 million in the last six months, which roughly coincides with the timing of when energy prices began to decline.", "Finally, capital ratios were largely unchanged relative to the prior quarter. Federal Reserve did not object to our 2015 capital plan, which included the increase in the quarterly dividend that Harris already mentioned, as well as a reduction of up to $300 million in preferred equity. We're not yet prepared to say much more about that but we'll at the appropriate time.", "The outlook, comments on the outlook. Our outlook is a reminder; is not for the next quarter, but kind of the general trends over the next four quarters relative to the most recent quarter.", "With regard to loan growth, we're maintaining our slight to moderate outlook for loans. This guidance factors in the growth and non-growth in non-energy loans, but the expectation that energy loan balances will reduce as we go through the borrowing base redetermination process and as the energy industry raises capital and reduces leverage, which is the general trend that we're already seeing out there.", "We expect net interest income to increase slightly partially due to loan growth and continued purchases of MBS, and the expected benefit of lower interest expense related to the maturity of the high cost sub debt that matures in the third and fourth quarters of this year in which we expect to pay off that maturity. These factors we expect to be offset declines in loan yields as discussed earlier, and thus, this part of the outlook does not include the effect of any rate increases that may be announced by the Federal Reserve.", "We expect core components of non-interest income such as service fees to increase modestly as we continue to press forward on organic growth and fee income. We generally would reaffirm our expectation of non-interest expenses of approximately $1.6 billion annually. And finally, with regard to the provision expense, on average, we would probably expect modestly positive provisions for credit losses in the next several quarters, driven by further potential credit re-grading in the energy portfolio offset by a stable to improving credit quality in some other segments and by loan growth.", "Finally, just a few personal comments. This will be my last earnings call. I went through the list of those of you on the phone who cover us with James, and I think there are eight or 10 of you who have covered Zions from darn near the whole time I've been here, at least couple of you the entire time. I'm not going to single you out by name for fear of omitting someone inadvertently, except for Brian Klock, who I'm going to award my bad timing catch-a-falling-knife award for transitioning into coverage in 2008. So, Brian, my sympathies to you. But really to all of you who have kind of been with us through quite an amazing period of time.", "I want to thank all of you. I've learnt from you. I've learnt from your questions. Wish you all well. I'm honored to have been at Zions, excuse me, it's kind of choking up here.", "Plenty of work ahead, but I'm pleased that Zions is \u2013 I'm leaving Zions in pretty good shape. Paul Burdiss is with us here. He's been on board for one week but he's wisely \u2013 he's affirmed my judgment of him in the interview. He has wisely invoked his right to remain silent in his first call and shows astute judgment on his part. But I will tell you, he's a darn quick study and I'm confident that you and Zions will be in really, really great hands and it won't be long before some of you who are trying to \u2013 will be trying to remember the name of that old CFO who used to work at Zions. Who was that old guy?", "Anyway with that, thank you all again for all the good association for \u2013 wasn't 15 years; I count 13.5 years, but some of those were doggy years during the crisis.", "James Richard Abbott - SVP-Investor Relations & External Communications", "It's something like 20. That's probably...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Exactly. So anyway, with that, we'll open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks so much, and Doyle, congratulations on your retirement. Certainly, wish you the best.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Joe.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I had a couple of quick questions. First, a clarification on the energy portfolio. It sounded like you took an additional $30 million of reserves or established additional $30 million reserves this quarter; did you also quantify any specific write-downs that were taken? And related to the downgrade at this point, are they coming more from the E&P book or the services, exposure and how does that compare versus your expectations?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "No, there were no energy-related charge-offs this quarter. Not to say there won't be in future quarters but none, and more of the downgrades came from the serve...", "Scott J. McLean - President", "From the reserve.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "From the reserve-based...", "Scott J. McLean - President", "From the reserve-based portfolio.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "...portfolio. We expect probably as we get through the \u2013 and those were kind of proactive adjustments on our part. Joe, we don't \u2013 we've not yet completed the reserve and borrowing base redetermination process, so a lot of those were based on the engineering reports from last fall and applying new pricing \u2013 current pricing to those reserves and they can proactively judging what may have happened.", "Some of that may, depending upon what they did in the way of new drilling in the fourth quarter, new reserves, we'll see. But they \u2013 we expect to keep that reserve base redertermine \u2013 reengineering and the borrowing base redetermination by late May, early June and then \u2013 and we'll also then start to get new financials from some of the services company. So there are more adjustments to come, but nothing that we've seen so far, I would say, is off-trend from what we were expecting when we \u2013 on our last earnings call.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Joe, this is Scott McLean. I would just echo Doyle's comments. This process of taking a reservoir analysis that's nearly 6 months old and putting new sensitivity pricing in it is a very imprecise process, but we did this really rigorously across the entire reserve-based portfolio and determined that there was a collection of reserve-based credits that we thought because of the degree that they were advanced and the science related with \u2013 associated with their reserves, the level of leverage, et cetera, et cetera, that it warranted downgrades. And I'll tell you, though, that having completed a portion of our reserve base redeterminations already that we've had about a handful of those redeterminations that have come in more favorably than the sensitivity analysis that we ran, which just simply makes the point of the crudeness of this process when you look at it prior to ...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "...the actual redetermination data.", "On the oil field service side, again, it's not nearly so easy to estimate. I mean, you really have to wait for financial information. And even though we have lots of anecdotal data and lots of communication with our clients, we'll need to look at March 31 data and then June 30 data and you'll start to see oil field service portfolio is adjusting in grade really in the second quarter and the third quarter, primarily.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "I'll add one final amplification. James, correct me if I'm wrong or Scott, but Harris mentioned on average down 12%, there's a wide dispersion around that. I think the worst was down close to 50% and the best was up over 40%. The median were on these reserve \u2013 that we were \u2013 that was \u2013 they were around in the 10% depending on whether you're talking mean, median, or whatever kind of high single-digits to low double-digits, as Harris mentioned.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The other thing I'd probably mention is just as kind of interesting thing to me, this is Harris, is that delinquencies in that portfolio are negligible.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Less than a quarter of a percent, dramatically less than a quarter of percentage point just more specific. So we are not seeing in the performance in the loans at this point any deterioration that's giving us concern. But just like a weather forecaster with a satellite image of what's coming, I mean, that's why we're grading these loans. We're really trying to be proactive and do what we, I think, we ought to be doing. But we're not seeing real evidence yet of the kind of deterioration that you might...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Maybe.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Next question.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's very helpful. I was looking as a follow-up to that. Similarly, any signs of deterioration yet in the non-energy piece in the Amegy book or is that \u2013 it's a bit early for that?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "No.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "No, the answer is no.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "No, we're not.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks so much.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Too soon to tell if it's \u2013 too early for that.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thought so. Okay, thanks very much.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jennifer.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Jennifer?", "Operator", "If you had your phone on mute, can you unmute your phone, please?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Why don't we take another question and then we come back to Jennifer if she's having difficulty?", "Jennifer Demba - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Can you hear me now?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Oh, got it. Yes. Okay. Hi, we got you now.", "Jennifer Demba - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Sorry about that. Doyle, all the best. We're really going to miss you. Congratulations.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jennifer. Miss you, too.", "Jennifer Demba - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yeah. So just a follow-up to Joe's question on non-energy loan deterioration specifically in Houston, just curious as to what you're seeing, Scott, in the economy there in Houston right now and in your commercial real estate credits. Could you just give us a little more color there?", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Sure, Jennifer. On the CRE side, you just have to go through each category, but obviously, we're watching office and multifamily most closely. The single-family construction, Houston will probably have 25,000 to 30,000 housing starts this year, and just because of the very conservative underwriting that came out of the 2008, 2009 downturn, I think residential will be very manageable in Texas and in Houston, specifically.", "Our office exposure is pretty manageable and we really only have a couple of credits that are less than $25 million in total exposure each and in one case, well less but they're with first-tier sponsors and great locations. So our office exposure is I think very manageable and multifamily is really the place where we're watching it closely. We had very few new originations in multifamily in 2014 and so our vintage component overall is favorable. And most of our multifamily projects that are coming online now are experiencing solid ramp on dynamics.", "Jennifer Demba - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks so much for the color. Appreciate it.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Yes.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question now comes from Paul Miller from FBR. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yeah. Thank you very much. Talking a little bit about your expense controls, now that CCAR is over, what line items can we see materially go down? My guess be personal expenses, but were there also some expenses in the other expense line item? I noticed that was down in the quarter.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, as I mentioned, the biggest change in the other non-interest expense line was the fact that there was a pretty large litigation settlement that we accrued in that line in the fourth quarter of a much smaller number in the first quarter and we think that was a very abnormal expense. So the bulk of the CCAR-related expenses does show up in the professional and consulting. And it was both help on the stress testing, but also in model validation and flushing out our enterprise risk management. So most of what you're going to see in the way of reduction going forward we think will be in that line. It's CCAR-related.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then how long will it take to get a lot of those expenses out? Are we talking about six months, nine months, a year?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, the spend on the outside consultants is basically all out. Now, as I mentioned, I would expect that line for the year to average a bit higher than it was in the first quarter because effectively we made almost no use of consultants for those purposes in the first quarter, while we're awaiting the detailed results of the qualitative exam and whatever MRAs that we get and whatnot because that's what will give us the roadmap for what do we have to fix, build, what have you, for the coming year. But all indications are that effort will be substantially less than it was in each of the last two years.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Hey, thank you very much.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Yeah. I would just add that there's a broad category of expenses that are in that other non-interest expense line. There's smaller items that you'll see providing favorable comparisons to this quarter and the previous quarter. And our salaries and our employment expense, there will naturally be favorable comparisons there as the number of FTEs comes down in the company.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Hey, guys. Thank you.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Ken.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, everybody. Doyle, best of luck again.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Ken.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "On the loan side, just wondering post-CCAR, how much more kind of protection against concentration limits do you guys have to work again? So when you talk about slight-to-modest loan growth on the outlook, how much is that related to what you guys are turning away or not doing, and how much is that related to organic improvement and just the natural growth trajectory?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "I think it's fair to say there's a much stronger pipeline for CRE construction and development loans than you're ever going to see in our outstanding balance \u2013 I mean, I guess I should say demand. I mean, there's a lot, very high-quality demand for that product and we're \u2013 because the Federal Reserve's models appear to attribute pretty high losses under stress to that kind of portfolio, we have to be very cautious about picking our spots in that portfolio, in particular. And otherwise try to move further away from that 5.1% number, and we're working on a lot of ways to potentially address that.", "Moving the CDO portfolio, the remainder of it to AFS gives us the flexibility to sell that portfolio, the remainder of it, even though we think what's left is of high quality and paying down at par may be prudent to \u2013 although we don't know for sure, it may be prudent to sell that as a further risk mitigation given the \u2013 and we'd rather use capital to make loans than hold that portfolio if it comes to a choice between the two. But there is some constraint, particularly on the CRE side at the present time.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And as a second follow-up on CCAR, can you talk about just your expected timeframe around calling those preferreds the debt redemptions? And at what point would you just get more comfortable with a bigger buyback ask?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, with regard to the debt, that's pretty calendared in. There are three issues and they all mature in the third or fourth quarter of this year. I forget whether it's two in one or one in two. So those require nothing other than writing a check, and that's the expectation.", "With regard to the preferred, the exact timing of any reduction and how we go about it, we'll not \u2013 obviously it's within the \u2013 the expectation is it's within the CCAR planning horizon, which does go out an extra quarter this year through the capital plan coverage through the second quarter of next year. I'm not saying it's all going to come at the very end, that's not what I'm trying to telegraph, but we have some flexibility in there.", "And then with regard to larger buybacks, et cetera, effectively, that's now \u2013 whatever the outlook for that might be, it's really a \u2013 starts with CCAR 2016, which will be submitted in early April of 2016. And it really won't become \u2013 you won't get the results back until early third quarter, I believe, or maybe the late second quarter. So it's a next big adjustment to our capital plan, unless things were to change dramatically. And we've resubmitted a whole new stress test and capital plan are \u2013 you're looking kind of mid-2016.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks again, and best of luck.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Erika.", "Erika P. Najarian - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Yes. Hi, good afternoon. And, Doyle, good luck in lowering that handicap.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Erika P. Najarian - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "I just had a question, and I'm sorry if this is a basic one on the redetermination process. So if your E&P companies have hedges currently in place under production during the current redetermination process, are you basing any sort of allowance rebasing or credit line reduction based on that current hedge? And will the \u2013 you'll just have to \u2013 when that hedge rolls off, then that's when you'll reevaluate further?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, the borrowing...", "Erika P. Najarian - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "I am trying to see how forward \u2013 go ahead, sorry.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "The borrowing base in the reserve redetermination are looking out multiple years; and that's a discounted value; and hedges that are in place are taken into account. But generally, they do not last beyond a few quarters to two years.", "Erika P. Najarian - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Got it. And...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "So, okay, where they're in place. I mean, they're taken into account for as long as the hedges for the term of the currently known hedge, but no potential future hedges. After that, you're just looking at the forward curve on our price deck.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "And that's an industry norm.", "Erika P. Najarian - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Got it. But just so \u2013 so for example, if a client hedges are rolling off in a year, that's taking into account in terms of the current allowance that you're setting aside, if needed?", "Scott J. McLean - President", "It's taken into account in terms of the borrowing base calculation, which would then inform us as to how we feel about the exposure we have against that borrowing base.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "So it directly affects the value we place on the reserves and therefore the size of the commitment that we're willing to make, when indirectly, all of that's taken into account in setting the allowance.", "Erika P. Najarian - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. Thank you and, Doyle, good luck again.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, thank you. Just a question on the TruPS CDOs. Doyle, I think, you mentioned in prior answer that sort of if push comes to shove and you had to choose between the two. But aren't we already there, I mean, don't you \u2013 you do have to choose whether or not you want to sell these TruPS CDOs, receive capital credit, and take the loss or not to sell them? What exactly are you guys waiting for to make that determination?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "That's a judgment about market conditions and other things, and I think it is a market; it's not a highly liquid market. I'd like you to just defer to us on when to make that judgment and actually make that call. But clearly, I don't \u2013 I mean, your general sentiment that that appears to be \u2013 for one thing I'll just tell you the Fed's results are for securities losses, it doesn't say CDO losses there. One has to make an informed judgment about, is that where they come from, it's \u2013 we think that's probably the case, just because look at the rest of our portfolio, it's hard to figure out where else it might be coming from. But it's not a slam \u2013 it's just not a slam dunk. We'll be \u2013 and again, there \u2013 we think there is zero stress loss in it ourselves, but someone else may not have agreed.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Okay. Following the question just in terms of the loan growth outlook I think I did hear you refer to the fact that other markets would be stronger and Texas would be a little bit weaker. But just want to make sure that is the weaker Texas loan growth, is that all energy-related or is it energy obviously going down but also all other loans in Texas also under pressure?", "Scott J. McLean - President", "I would primarily relate the softness obviously to the energy sector. We're seeing \u2013 as we noted last quarter, we're seeing pay downs coming in the energy sector that are offsetting the growth in non-energy sectors, the CRE underwriting. We started slowing down, as I mentioned, in multifamily early last year and likewise in office towards the middle 'til the end of last year. And so those are two pretty large portfolios in Texas and they have both \u2013 we've enhanced our approval \u2013 we haven't enhanced our approval process, but we're just slowing the underwriting there. But our middle-market business activity is there; and the upper-end, the small business, continue to do moderately well, they're growing nicely.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "I'd just add that for the first few weeks of this quarter, loan growth in the company is actually stronger to Amegy than anywhere else. But it's the \u2013 looking out again our guidance is over the kind of the \u2013 looking out the next year and we think we're pretty confident that borrowing base are going to come down as a result of the reserve, reengineering, and the redetermination process. And that we'll be exercising more caution there as the year \u2013 the fact that we're exercising more caution will be reflected in loan growth for the rest of the year there. It's not that Texas is falling off a cliff. It's not.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Not at all. In fact, the 1-4 family business there, there's a little bit of a refinancing boom going on at the moment, has been for the last three, four months. And so we're experiencing that around the company but especially in Texas and so we should see some nice 1-4 family growth there as well.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon, guys.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Dave.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Regarding the cash, you deployed a decent amount of that into securities this quarter. How much of that are you expecting you'll ultimately shift over to that securities bucket over the next couple of years? Is the goal to shift most of it over to securities over time?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. Yes. I mean we expect \u2013 I mean, we're kind of on close to $2 billion a year net run rate; maybe $1.7 billion to $2 billion. Again, the stuff is short-to-medium duration; so it does pay down, but fairly quickly as well. But that is the goal, yes.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. And then, Doyle...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "It's to give up the \u2013 it's to pick-up the yield but give up the asset sensitivity gradually, and not run significant duration risk by even when we're buying securities by those that have less duration expense than 30-year fixed-rate MBS.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right. That makes sense. And then, one last one, Doyle. If the $50 billion threshold, asset threshold were raised, how much excess capital do you think you would have? And then, how could that possibly change how you might opt to grow the loan book whether it would be more growth in construction or anything else, just any comments there?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Well. I guess, I don't want to say Ollie Ollie in come free because that's not the case. But the gap \u2013 but if you look at our stress test results, which are public for the results of our models and our process, we came up with an 8.6% number under what we thought were fairly conservative models, compared to 5.1%. So there is a very large gap there when you apply over 3% to risk-weighted assets of about $48 billion. Dave?", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Doyle, once again, real pleasure working with you over the years. Congrats again.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Likewise. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Eads from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, guys. Just kind of following up on the redetermination process. You talked about that there's a pretty decent decline in the commitment, and you said mostly it's related to non-reserve-based commitments. Should we think about that as being mostly the energy services?", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Yes. I'll be happy to give you a couple of examples because they speak to what we talked about in December and then again in January. But just some examples. We had a number of companies that are supported by sponsors that had classified loans with us, or loans that we had taken to a classification; and they came in proactively based on our negotiations with them to literally pay the loans off. In one case, a sponsor paid a line of credit off totally to merge this particular company into another portfolio company. So you see that happening.", "Also you see natural working capital contraction going on. And that can be quite significant in one client whose credit facility was well over $100 million. You saw a reduction from working capital contraction, a projection of close to 40% of the credit facility. And so that's going to bring outstandings down, commitments down. And so, again, you're seeing proactivity on the part of sponsors. You're seeing...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Seeing others go to the public market.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "You're seeing others go to the public markets. A great example of that in our reserve-based portfolio, the commitment that we had that was about $35 million, that was reduced to the low-teens largely because of a significant capital raise in the public subordinated debt markets. And so, again, what we saw in the last downturn and what we talked about, which is a significant amount of proactive work in the oil field service sector and it's beginning in the reserve-based sector to right size borrowing bases and credit facilities.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "That's really helpful there. And is that kind of what gives you confidence that this kind of proactivity that you do have your arms around what's kind of going on in the services portfolio even before you get the updated financials?", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Without a question. We did a sensitivity analysis on the energy services portfolio in November and December where we took every client, literally every client we knew, their product mix by geography and product, and we stressed their EBITDAs based on geography and product and the history of the company. We also \u2013 again, as we've noted before, we have about six private equity firms that we work with on the energy services side and about six on the reserve-based side. So we don't work with every private equity firm that walks in the door. These are extremely experienced energy private equity firms; and we watched what they did in the last downturn and they're doing it again at a much quicker rate than they did it in the last downturn.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. And, Doyle, best of luck. Certainly, end of an era.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Jesus.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "Not that you're that old.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "The stretcher is waiting right outside the door.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "That's all right.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Not the gurney, but the stretcher.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "Right, right. Okay, so back to energy, the \u2013 I just want to see, do you have the quantifications of the criticized or classified ratios by oil service versus E&P and the same for the NPL ratio?", "Scott J. McLean - President", "The answer is, we do, yeah. I'm not sure I can do it a cappello. I've got notes in front of me and I bet we can come up with that number as a follow-up item.", "James Richard Abbott - SVP-Investor Relations & External Communications", "Yeah. I'll get it for you, John, here. I'll just work on it for a second.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Yeah, I'd rather not...", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. I appreciate it. And then, I guess, getting back to the topic you just discussed, as you continue to \u2013 as you complete the assessment of the oil service portfolio, Scott, as you said that you're just getting into finishing that. Is it fair to assume that the pace of additions to the loan loss reserve could actually accelerate because of the higher inherent loss content of oil service or is that not the way to think about it?", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Yeah. I want to make sure I clarify. We have been continuously looking at the energy services portfolio, but we've not experienced much in the way of downgrades there yet, and we don't anticipate that until, quite frankly, the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but we'll some deterioration in the second quarter. And so we'll see some additional classifieds and special mention as a result of that, which will attract reserves. But recall too that we have \u2013 our qualitative reserve is \u2013 I don't know that we've mentioned it on the call yet, but our qualitative reserve and our ACL, we did not reduce it this quarter. So as we had migration and the quantitative reserve is increased, we've left our qualitative reserve at the same size and actually I think we've built it a bit.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Increase, yeah.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "We increased it.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "So as we see migration starting to attract more quantitative reserve at some point, we'll pull down on the qualitative reserve. So it's kind of hard to know.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. The actual total energy-related reserves at Amegy actually built more than the $55 million. That was the net add at Amegy during the quarter. I don't know that I would expect an acceleration. I forgot exactly what your question was about criticized and classified, but the oil and gas total portfolio criticized is 15.7%, which is inclusive of classified of just over 9%. The upstream portion is higher; the lowest is downstream, another E&P, and kind of services and midstream are in between. If that helps you.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "I would just add that we've not seen anything yet that has surprised us. So I know you'd expect us to say that, but we really haven't. And we've actually seen more positives occurring quicker than we would have anticipated or that we saw in the last downturn.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Got it. And if I could just ask one more topic. On loan growth, I know you indicated slight-to-moderate loan growth. Is it fair to assume that it remains in this recent range, so low-single digit 1% to 3% annualized range? Is that fair to assume?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Below 5% probably I don't know, but maybe not down \u2013 maybe \u2013 hopefully not 1% but somewhere in between 2% to 4%...", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Would be a rough guess. I think we need to go into our \u2013 we're at time here. We've got a few questioners still holding. We'll run over by the amount of my valedictory farewell there and take a \u2013 go into a lightning round: one question, no follow-up, quick answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker, Compass Point. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Kevin James Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC", "Thank you for taking my questions. On the energy portfolio, what was the peak classified levels that you experienced in the last downturn? And what level of reserves did you put against those, not only on the commercial loans but also on the commercial real estate lending?", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Well, the peak on energy for classifieds was about 20%, and recall that our peak loss rate in any 12-month period was 1%. The aggregate charge-offs to-date in that portfolio through the end of the year from the inception of the business which was in the mid-1990s was about $60 million.", "The last question you asked, I...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "The CRE, we don't know even know.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Yeah.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "The composition of the CRE at Amegy was dramatically different. There was a lot more earlier-stage land development residential purposes than there is today. That's all gone for all intents and purposes, so...", "Scott J. McLean - President", "Yeah. Specifically, CRE exposure in Texas is about $1 billion \u2013 $1.3 billion less today than it was in 2008 and \u2013 going into that downturn, and the land exposure was \u2013 it peaked at about $985 million in the 2008 time period. It's well less than $200 million today, and most of it's performing very nicely and it's just very old vintage land loans. And so the bank was not a land lender before, it's just that's the way you've started a construction loan back in that cycle. And so it will...", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Not anymore.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "(1:02:26) bank loans client process.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Okay. Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Everyone. I just wanted to follow up on the pricing pressure impacting loan production with the weighted coupon flat this quarter, does that imply that we should expect incremental downward pressure on loan yields coming in 2Q?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, but again offset we think by the continued securities purchases and loan growth and then in Q3 in addition to those items, you'll have the pay-off of the sub-debt that's very expensive.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Good luck, Doyle. Thank you.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Steve, thank you. Some good times we've had.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Tenner from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Gary Peter Tenner - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks. Hi, guys. I think you said that as of 12/31, the reserve against energy portfolio was around 1.85% or 1.9%, if memory serves, can you tell us what that is as of March 31?", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, yeah, the 1.75% \u2013 it was actually 1.75% was the number at December 31. And today, we would estimate that it's about 2.5% or higher. It depends on really how you allocate the qualitative reserve at Amegy in their commercial and industrial portfolio. But if you were to put half of it into the energy portfolio, you're probably getting close to a 3% reserve ratio at that point.", "Gary Peter Tenner - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. Thanks. Doyle, best of luck to you.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "You mentioned that you will come back to us in two or three months with some thoughts on the cost saves you could get from technology initiatives. What sort of process you're going through internally to figure those out? What are sort of areas that you're looking at and how do you think about calculating the type of saves you could realize?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's \u2013 I'll tell you as we have a number of people involved in putting those numbers together and assessing both the magnitude and the expected timing of benefits we're expecting to see from some of those \u2013 from these projects but that's the best I can tell you. You just \u2013 you have to kind of stay tuned but I \u2013 we do think in the next two to three months, we'll be able to provide much better information. And both with respect to these savings coming out of these projects and other things that we're focused on.", "Scott J. McLean - President", "I would just add to that these projects, as you know, take place over 2000 \u2013 really the heavy implementation is late \u2013 mid to late this year, 2016, 2017 and even into 2018. So the process of identifying savings in 2017 and 2018 from technology that's being \u2013 continued to being developed today is pretty complicated, although the common \u2013 the theme is that we're adopting common practices across the entire company at a rapid pace. And we're generally focused on trying to accelerate that adoption well in advanced of these new technologies coming in to place.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "So the effort involves trying to understand without actually being in a position to do it yet, what some of the, for example, re-engineering of processes, opportunities that will present themselves as we get this stuff in place and then what might the cost savings be as a result of that. so that we're \u2013 when we do come out, it's not just pie in the sky, it's \u2013 there's actually a fair amount of thought behind it. And that's what I would say in regard to your, what's the process question, it's \u2013 we're actually digging down into this. Okay?", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Thank you.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Next question? That's it.", "Operator", "I'm sorry. No further questions at this time, sir.", "Doyle L. Arnold - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, with that, let me once again say thank you to all of you. I was sincere when I said that your questions have been thoughtful, sometimes tough. That's what you're supposed to do, and I've learned from them as well as from answering them most of the time at least and I really do appreciate the association. Wish you all well. James?", "James Richard Abbott - SVP-Investor Relations & External Communications", "Thanks very much.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "James R. Abbott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and External Communications", "Thank you very much, Abigail, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our second quarter 2015 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release, and in the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "With that, I will turn the time over to Harris Simmons. Harris?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, James, and welcome to all of you who are participating on the call today. As mentioned, we published a slide deck for today's call, which we hope will be helpful especially when reviewing the performance of certain income statement items.", "Before we begin with the slides, I'd comment that the results of the second quarter of 2015 were generally in line overall with those of the analyst community, somewhat better fee income, offsetting somewhat softer net interest income and lower credit costs offsetting somewhat higher non-interest expenses.", "If you turn to slide three, which simply remind you, we made a couple of significant announcements during the second quarter, the most prominent of which regards our efficiency and organizational structure initiative, which I'm confident most of you are familiar with.", "Most notably, we're reducing the number of bank charters from seven to one, and substantially simplifying the back office operations in the company. These changes should result in a better experience for both customers and employees, and they're really focused on making many processes simpler and easier and faster.", "Once implemented, these changes should ultimately produce both better revenue and expense trajectories, stronger revenue and holding the line on expenses for 2016 of less than $1.6 billion annually with only a slight increase in non-interest expense in 2017. We provided and are affirming an efficiency ratio target of less than or equal to 70% in the second half of 2015, less than or equal to 66% in 2016, and in the low 60%s in 2017. I've been very encouraged with the employee response to such substantial changes; survey of a large sample of our employees indicates very strong support for the organizational actions we're taking.", "Turning to slide four. Our other major announcement this quarter was with respect to the sale of the CDO portfolio, remaining securities in that portfolio. In the most recent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR exercise, our securities portfolio produced a loss of approximately $400 million in the Federal Reserve's severely adverse stress model. While Zions owned other securities besides the CDOs, we had no reason to believe that any of those securities would have triggered any loss, as they consist of a municipal bond portfolio that has produced virtually no losses historically and securities that are generally backed by government guarantees, such as our Small Business Administration securities, government agency mortgage-backed securities and cash deposit at the Federal Reserve.", "Thus we concluded that the treatment of the CDO portfolio and the Federal Reserve's stress testing models under hypothetical severely adverse economic environments was highly unsatisfactory, and was a major catalyst in our decision to sell the balance of the portfolio. As an isolated item, this reduced our risk-weighted assets by $1 billion or about 2% of the total risk-weighted assets.", "In contrast, revenue from such securities was less than $10 million annually, making the return on the Federal Reserve's post-stress equity equal to about 1%, which made the decision to sell fairly easy. I would note that by exercising some patience on these securities over the years, we were able to achieve a price that was several hundred million dollars in excess of the price we would have experienced in 2009.", "Turning to slide five, on credit quality, we're pleased to report that credit quality is holding up very well. There's really only one segment of our portfolio that is experiencing any degree of stress, which I'll discuss in a moment, but the overall rate of increase on classified loans was very slight, at 1.9%, non-performing assets declined more than 3% from the prior quarter.", "Our reserve ratio is quite strong, although not shown relative to the peers here on this slide, Zions is one of the strongest in the industry by a number of ways of measuring it. You can see this reflected by the coverage of non-performing asset and net charge-offs at 1.9 times and 15 times, respectively.", "Our reserve on our energy portfolio did not change relative to the prior quarter. We previously indicated that we've built a very strong reserve in the fourth quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015. And although we transferred some of the qualitative reserve to the quantitative portion of the reserve, if you will, in the second quarter as classified energy loans increased moderately, we did not need to increase the energy reserve, which is about 3% of total energy loans. Overall, we expect loan losses will remain well contained. Even considering the moderate stress in the energy portfolio, we're not expecting a significant deviation from the recent run rate of net charge-offs.", "Turning to slide six, I would highlight two items. First, the oil and gas loan portfolio balances declined to $3.1 billion from $3.4 billion at March 31, with a proportion of the portfolio remaining relatively stable. Much of this is attributable to the statistics displayed on the right-hand side of the chart. Capital markets and private equity support of these companies has been very strong. We even hear of a number of potential investors receiving substantially less than their desired allocation on some of these recapitalization deals. This activity is obviously very helpful in right-sizing the capital of the energy companies and mitigating credit risk for Zions, but is resulting in a considerable headwind to our overall loan growth, which was the weak spot for us this quarter.", "As an outlook for energy lending trends, we expect continued loan balance reductions of between $100 million and $200 million in the second half of the year, a much slower rate of attrition than we've experienced in the most recent quarter, but still a significant headwind.", "As we conducted the spring borrowing base redetermination process on energy exploration and production credits, we used a price deck that is reflective of current market prices, which can be seen in the appendix slides of the recent Barclays Conference materials. We expect some further downgrades in the energy portfolio as we see second quarter results from oilfield services companies. But as we speak to those companies, they are generally feeling that their second quarter results may be fairly reflective of the foreseeable run rate, given the current pricing of oil at between $45 and $55 per barrel. Therefore, the downgrades we are anticipating should be the bulk of what is to come, and we have generally reserved for those downgrades.", "And so in summary, the deterioration of energy credits is playing out consistently with, and in some cases somewhat better, than our outlook in December of 2014, when we first alerted you to the potential implications of the adverse movement of energy prices.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul to review our financials. Paul?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Harris. Turning to slide seven. For the second quarter of 2015, Zions reported a $1.1 million, or $.01 per share loss. Adjusting for the one-time loss related to the sale of collateralized debt obligation securities, earnings per share were $0.41 in the second quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, we experienced an improvement in net interest income, reflecting an additional day in the quarter and in fee income, which I will review shortly in more detail.", "We also experienced an increase in non-interest expense, although there were a number of items within that result that warrant a more detailed review. The provision for loan and lease losses was slightly positive, a byproduct of the extensive analysis of the appropriate reserve at each of our affiliate banks.", "If I could, let me direct your attention to the capital ratios at the bottom of this page. You'll notice that the Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.91% and that the prior quarter's ratio is lower than originally reported. This is due to the fact that we have made an adjustment to the risk-weighting of some of our construction and land development loans, migrating them to the Basel III category of high-volatility commercial real estate, or HVCRE.", "As described in the press release, a clarifying Frequently Asked Question document was released by the regulators during the quarter and, after our review of that document, we concluded that it would be appropriate to classify a portion of our construction and land development loans into the HVCRE category, which receives a risk-weighting of 150%, up from the standard 100% for a non-HVCRE commercial loan.", "The key issue in this reclassification relates to the loan contract and whether or not it contains a clause that prevents the borrower from withdrawing cash from the deal. For example, as construction progresses, a certificate of occupancy is issued to the building, and the building begins to experience net positive cash flow. However, the building's cash flow is not yet fully sufficient to qualify for permanent financing. Typically, a developer may begin to utilize some of that positive cash flow for other purposes, while the loan-to-value ratio of a loan may remain low and therefore would be substantially stronger than underwriting guidelines. Because the lending contract does not specifically prevent the extraction of some of the cash flow from the deal, our interpretation of the FAQ document has led us to reclassify such loans as HVCRE under the Basel III rules.", "Turning to slide eight, net interest income rose by about $6 million versus the prior quarter to $424 million, reflecting an additional calendar day in the quarter. This led to a net interest margin of 3.18% in the second quarter, which was down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. Much of this decline was attributable to a shift in the mix of the balance sheet toward cash and investment securities. This shift was driven by the strong inflow of deposits, with average deposits rising by more than $640 million in the quarter. Without commensurate loan growth due in part to accelerated prepayments, the growth in deposits was largely channeled into lower-yielding deposits at the Federal Reserve and other interest-bearing cash instruments, which increased by more than $400 million from the prior quarter.", "The chart on slide nine depicts the reported yield on the loan portfolio. The coupon of the portfolio, which excludes amortizing origination fees and the coupon on new production, notably the green segment shows an increase in the coupon on new production, although much of this is due to a mix shift in production, including an increase in small business loans and a decrease in large corporate deals. Holding deal size and loan grade constant, pricing has generally been stable for the last couple of quarters, which is an encouraging trend. We also note that an increase in short-term interest rates would likely move the yield on Zions' loan production to a level which is higher than the overall portfolio, assuming pricing discipline could be maintained.", "Regarding loan volume, total loan production increased about 5% from the prior quarter. Period-end loan balances, excluding energy-related credits, increased $128 million from the prior quarter. However, due to strong prepayments and energy credits, as mentioned earlier by Harris, as well as elevated levels of prepayments on both residential and commercial mortgages, overall loans declined $156 million from the prior quarter end.", "Turning to slide 10, reported non-interest income was less than $1 million. However, this slide depicts three adjustments that we believe are informative for assessing the underlying strength of non-interest income. The first bar adds back the sum of all equity and debt securities gains and losses or about $134 million. The second bar adjusts for the fair value and non-hedge derivative income line item, which is traditionally a volatile number. The third bar adjusts for the gain on the sale of a branch.", "The net effect of these adjustments is a non-interest income figure of about $130 million. This is a fairly strong increase relative to the prior quarter and was attributable to strength in several areas, including larger commercial deposit account analysis fees, strong growth in bank card, interest rate swaps purchased by our customers and increased loan servicing income. These positive trends were offset somewhat by declines in insufficient funds fees, which is consistent with recent industry experience.", "Slide 11 is intentionally titled Informing the Outlook, and is not intended to reconcile to a core or operating number for non-interest expense, as some of the expenses outlined here are clearly integral to running the company. Instead, the information on slide 11 is intended to provide transparency on the underlying trend of non-interest expenses. I'll highlight a couple of the bars on this page and then address questions later as needed.", "First, seasonal share-based compensation adjustment is the amount of stock that is granted to employees that are immediately eligible for retirement. And as such, these expenses are recognized immediately rather than amortized over a period of years that is typical of stock grants. For Zions, this occurs each year in the second quarter, and we have referenced the seasonal impact in past earnings calls. It is an operating cost, but does not generally occur in the other quarters.", "The next bar to the right represents a cost of certain incentive plans that are affected by stock price. Employees are granted units that generally pay after three years if certain long-term goals are accomplished. While these units ultimately pay out in cash, the total payment is tied to share price performance, which is intended to align the interest of these employees to both long-term goals and to the price of Zions' stock. While the second quarter \u2013 with the second quarter's strong share price performance, an additional accrual was warranted for these plans.", "The last part I will highlight is the $9 million in insurance recoveries, which were largely related to the legal settlement reached in the fourth quarter of 2014. The result of all of these pluses and minuses is approximately a $400 million non-interest expense figure. While we are still in the early stages of our cost reduction efforts, we expect that costs for the second half of this year will be below $800 million, bringing the overall non-interest expense for 2015 to below $1.6 billion.", "On slide 12, we outline the efficiency ratio to which we are managing. We believe our definition is consistent with the industry standard, and modified slightly to exclude the effect of the provision for unfunded lending commitments, severance and restructuring items. While our efficiency ratio has been trending favorably over the past several quarters, we will continue to drive performance improvements in order to realize our efficiency ratio objectives, which are below 70% in the second half of 2015, and below 66% in 2016, with continued improvement thereafter.", "Page 13 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our slightly to moderately increasing outlook for loans. This outlook incorporates changing portfolio composition, as the energy industry raises capital and reduces leverage. In the next six months, we're expecting loan growth to be on the lower end of that range, accelerating slowly as the size of the energy portfolio stabilizes.", "We're raising our outlook for net interest income to moderately increasing from slightly increasing, driven primarily by the continued addition of duration in the investment portfolio and from lower interest expense related to the expected reduction of high-cost debt in the second half of this year. Our outlook does not include the effect of any rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect a benefit to annual net interest income of about $150 million for each 100 basis point increase in short-term rates.", "Of course, we recognize that by extending the duration of the investment portfolio, we are tempering that rate sensitivity somewhat, but we're comfortable that by building our exposure to duration over time, and limiting extension risk in the portfolio where possible, we will be able to add to net interest income if rates rise, while protecting earnings in an adverse economic environment.", "We expect that non-interest income will increase moderately, as we continue to focus heavily on this key source of revenue. And as stated previously, we're committed to holding non-interest expense to less than $1.6 billion for both 2015 and 2016, excluding severance and restructuring expenses.", "Finally, we have modified our outlook on the provision for loan losses to flat to slightly positive from positive. We've attempted to describe during this call the situation with the energy loan portfolio in the expected credit deterioration there; however, we believe that we've captured the bulk of that migration in the qualitative reserve already. Other segments in the portfolio continue to perform very well and loss rates remain very low.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Abigail, would you please open up the line for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hello, everybody.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Paul, I just wanted to ask you on the expenses. I think I just got what you said. The $800 million in the second half, are you only excluding severance and restructuring, because on page 15 you gave a whole list of items you're excluding, I guess, to come up with the efficiency ratio? But in terms of the $1.6 billion for the year, are those the only two items you are adjusting for?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, that's correct, Steven.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then a no shocker, I have a question on the energy exposure. You guys provide the classified energy loans of $325 million in the quarter. Could you provide what the balance of criticized loans were, and how that changed? And just an update of how much of the $3.1 billion in energy are Shared National Credits? Thanks.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "So, we mentioned \u2013 this is Scott McLean. We mentioned the criticized level on energy in the first quarter call, we don't normally disclose that, but because we did in that call, it's about 20% today. And for criticized, classified is 11% and the percentage of Shared National Credits on the reserve base portfolio is about 80%; on the oilfield services portfolio, it's less than 60%, it's about 55% or less, little bit less.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with KBW. Your line is open.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Good evening, gentlemen.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Brian.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "So a question for you, Paul. I guess, thinking about the Fed change with CCAR moving to CET1 versus the Tier 1 common, and thinking about last year's severe adverse scenario, Zions did much better versus \u2013 on the Tier 1 common, and obviously there's a lower threshold than CET1 I guess. Should we be thinking about that I guess, more positively for Zions, I guess, moving to next year's CCAR with CET1 being a focus?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So that \u2013 you're referring, of course, to the notice of proposed rulemaking that came out last Friday. And in fact, when you look at our CCAR results under the severely adverse case, we were at, if you may recall, about 5.1% of Tier 1 common equity under the Basel I definition versus a limit of 5%. If that, in fact, goes away for next year, as you correctly pointed out, we'll be focused on the Basel III definitions, which is a common equity Tier 1 measure. And on that basis, in last year's submission, we reported a number of about 6%, versus a limit of 4.5%.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Actually \u2013 I mean, the Fed reported that (23:13).", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Great. So in thinking about it, and I guess, as a follow-up, if we think about that, and what you guys have done to sort of reposition the risk and getting rid of the CDO portfolio, I guess all things equal, you'd have a CET1 ratio that'd be in the 6% range, versus a 4.5% limit in that CCAR process?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Look, I'll be honest with you \u2013 it's sometimes difficult to predict the outcome of the test, but I will say that we expect our buffer, if you want to call it that, this next coming year, under a Basel III basis, would be better than what we experienced under the Basel I basis last year.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Right. Thanks for your time, guys.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "(24:02).", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, thanks. Question on the high volatility CRE loans. Obviously, it hits the risk-weighted assets this quarter, is there anything that you guys can do on a going-forward basis, like can you rewrite the contracts when they come due? How quickly are changes actually possible on this, or do you plan to make any changes to help bring down the risk-weighting on those? Thanks.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We'll have Michael Morris, who is our Chief Credit Officer, discuss that. Michael?", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, Ken, there are things that we can do contractually with the borrower to preclude internally-generated capital i.e., cash flow, from coming out of a construction project. There are market considerations not to do that, but we can do that to stem the higher risk weight, that's an option. We can also price for those loans differently. So, there are several options that we have that we're looking at, and that will be dictated somewhat by the market and somewhat by credit risk.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Sorry, just to clarify, so is that something you actually plan to do, or should we just kind of assume that the risk-weighting stays elevated?", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, the risk-weighting will go down naturally as construction loans pay off and convert to term. And then, going forward, we will be putting provisions into the loan language, again, that potentially preclude internally-generated cash flow, i.e., debt service, from coming out, but there will be market considerations around that as well.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think that's just a way of saying, it's going to be a case-by-case assessment we have to make around the value of the relationship, the pricing on the deal, when the \u2013 what the market is like competitively.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, I would remind you this is a fairly new sort of FAQ and interpretation. So, yeah, we are working through the impact on the portfolio, particularly from the perspective of what the market is willing to bear.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Understood. Okay. And then, just one follow-up question. On the fee side, I think you have the slide showing the sort of core fees was around $130 million, but it did include a lot of sort of good things. Just, a lot of line items are a little bit higher. Is $130 million kind of a good starting point for next quarter, or is there a little more of a reversion lower, is a starting point? Thanks.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. The purpose of the slide was to try to provide a basis for kind of ongoing expectations. And so the adjustments we've made, we believe, make that number a decent starting point.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Hello. It's Geoff Elliot from Autonomous.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Geoff.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Hello, Geoff.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Hi. Quick question, again, on regulation. If there's a decision to raise the $50 billion threshold for inclusion within CCAR to something higher than your current asset size, can you give a sense of what you'd expect the impacts of that to be, both in terms of expenses and then in terms of increased flexibility around capital, and how you might think about managing your capital structure differently?", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. I think, obviously, the devil's in the details always with these things, and so it's hard to know exactly what the implications would be until you know what other expectations might be embedded in the language of any statute that replaces the current language. But, because I would assume that we will continue, in any event \u2013 we would expect that we would continue to conduct Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests. The cost of that exercise, I expect, would moderate somewhat. The level of detail and the sophistication of the models, in terms of continuing to improve them and just the maintenance of the apparatus that we use to conduct those tests, would probably moderate in cost. So \u2013 but it's hard to know exactly how much. We \u2013 I've noted that we spend about $20 million last year in direct cost on the CCAR stress testing exercise. I don't expect all of that would go away, but I expect that the number would probably moderate significantly.", "I think the most important outcome, in many respects, would be just greater clarity around how we manage capital; we'd be managing to our own internal models, presumably. We would not be subject to the vagaries of the Federal Reserve's models which are, you should know, not particularly transparent. And we believe that that would be a very positive outcome, in terms of how we go about thinking about managing capital. But beyond that, we just have to see what happens. I do think there is a fair amount of positive sentiment. You saw last week that Janet Yellen, Chairman of the Fed, indicated that she would support an increase in the $50 billion threshold; we've seen that from Governor Tarullo, from a variety of politicians. And so we're hopeful that that momentum will continue, would be a very positive outcome for the company.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Thanks. And then a quick follow-up, given that you've been relatively tight on the CCAR exercise this year and you had the objection last year, how much do you think that kind of feeds into your thinking on potential to be much more ambitious when it comes around to next year and you are sub-missing a capital loss?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's just premature to speculate on that. We'll want to see how our own internal results from our own stress testing turn out, and that's something we'll need to review with our board. We \u2013 I don't think we have a view on that yet.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Great. Thank you.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I guess the release mentioned that the results include the findings of the Shared National Credit exam. Did you see many downgrades from that? And coming out of it, roughly how much of your energy reserves are still unallocated or in that kind of qualitative bucket?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Joe, first of all, on the Shared National Credit exam, as we indicated, the results are fully baked into the numbers we've presented. And we didn't experience any material changes to what we had internally. And as for the reserve, the last part of your question, I'm not sure; I don't have a specific response to that at the moment.", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, there was a \u2013 just a very slight decline in the qualitative reserve. And as that \u2013 some of that qualitative reserve migrated to the quantitative reserve, but it was very \u2013 very slight.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. That makes sense.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "And that's...", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "Particularly to the energy portfolio.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "And that's consistent with what we have been saying was that we would not \u2013 we would not make any major changes in the qualitative reserve. In terms of shifting it to the quantitative, probably in the first couple of quarters here, we need to see more experience and \u2013 but it would suggest that the experience through the second quarter was more favorable than we expected.", "We still believe that we'll see an increase, as we note, in classified assets on the energy side in the third quarter and fourth quarter, and it will particularly come in energy services, but we've been saying that since last December. We don't anticipate significant increases in reserve-based credits during the third quarter and fourth quarter.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Right.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "I think that gives you a bit more color.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah, no, that's very helpful. Thanks, Scott. I guess the other question is, just was curious if you can quantify the amount of kind of term CRE paydowns this quarter relative to the first. It sounds like they were elevated and given this trend, as well as the ongoing decline in the energy book, I mean, where do you expect to see some loan growth?", "James R. Abbott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and External Communications", "Yeah. Joe, this is James. The increased CPR speed on the term commercial real estate book increased about 5 percentage points linked quarter. And that's about the same we saw for the residential portfolio as well. So it was \u2013 you have to go back several years to find a CPR speed that was comparable to that, so it was an unusual quarter from that perspective.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "In terms of where loan growth will come from, it's \u2013 I mean, we're continuing to push on sort of the usual suspects which is \u2013 which would be C&I and consumer and particularly residential mortgage, though I would expect that we'll see some growth in CRE assuming that prepayment speeds don't continue at this pace.", "Joseph Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Okay. Thanks, Harris.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yep.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Jennifer Demba - Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "I am sorry, my question was just covered. Thank you.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jennifer.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Your line is open.", "Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Hey, afternoon. It's actually Thomas LeTrent for Paul. One quick question, I guess, again on the prepayments. I am assuming the loan growth guidance for the next 12 months assumes those moderated, is there anything as it relates to third quarter that's given you the confidence they'd slow down in the near term?", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Just too early to know I think.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, the outlook that we provided was a 12-month outlook, I would remind you.", "Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Right. Okay. So, nothing immediately, so far too early this early in the quarter. And then one follow-up on the $700,000 or the small item. On slide 11 for the non-interest expense, the professional services, is that something that could be in there going forward? Or was that just sort of a \u2013 because you had this initiative announced in the second quarter and that you sold the CDO portfolio, that should be sort of minimized going forward?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "It's \u2013 we're going to have expenses that I would describe as sort of restructuring costs. They may not be business closure-type expenses, but they'll be expenses that are necessary to facilitate the charter consolidation to facilitate the organizational simplification we're trying to bring about. And those kinds of costs we said we were excluding from the $1.6 billion.", "Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon, guys.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Hello.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I just had a question on the margin. On slide nine, I was just wondering how much of the difference between that yellow line from the book yield and the coupon line, that red line there, was accretion income this quarter. And then as you look at the loan pipeline, are you expecting to make shift to smaller loans that drove that uptick and the loan production coupon rates to persist through the second half?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "That probably is accurate because, particularly with the softness in energy underwriting, which is totally to be expected, the coupons there are generally lower, and so that you have a smaller volume of lower coupon transactions kind of just working into the mix.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "As it relates to the amount of accretion in between those, I don't think it's material. James, could follow-up with a precise number, but I don't think that's a material part of what you are seeing there.", "James R. Abbott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and External Communications", "Yeah, we \u2013 the only thing I would add is in terms of accretion, these are loan yields, of course, but on the margin, there was a couple of basis points of margin pressure more this quarter than there was last quarter on premium amortization from the MBS prepayments (38:01) accelerating.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. And then just one quick follow-up. We've heard some banks indicate a little bit more in the way of deposit pricing pressure this quarter. It doesn't look like you've had that from your results, but any color you can share there on what you are seeing in the market would be great.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's still very benign. I mean, we \u2013 we had pretty reasonable deposit growth and we're seeing it in non-interest bearing, and so we're just not seeing the need to go out and pay up for money anytime soon.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "And as you point out, the total rate we paid on deposits was consistent from quarter-to-quarter.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. All right. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities", "Good afternoon.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, John.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Good afternoon.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities", "The 30-day to 89-day past dues, they were up about $28 million or so linked-quarter, what drove that, was that energy at all or was that non-energy?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "I don't know if you have any...", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "I have a little color on that.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Michael Morris will...", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, energy up \u2013 energy was up slightly, but that would be it or (39:26) a couple of term loans, CRE term loans, but that would be the totality of it.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities", "Okay. All right. And secondly on energy, what percentage are you through the analyzing the oilfield service portfolio and getting the financial statements in and everything? Have you \u2013 did you get at that?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, sure. On the oil fields services portfolio, we \u2013 on that entire portfolio, at a minimum, we receive statements on a quarterly basis. And so, all of the first quarter numbers are in. I'm going to say all, I would say virtually all. On a number \u2013 a large percentage of that portfolio, we also receive numbers on a monthly basis. So I think you can feel comfortable that we've seen all of the first quarter numbers and we'll have all the second quarter numbers by mid-August to late August at the latest. And we expect to see, as we've noted numerous times, deterioration in the second quarter. The numbers didn't deteriorate that much in the first quarter, which we didn't think they would. But we will see deterioration in the second quarter and the third quarter and \u2013 but the \u2013 I would tell you that the relationships that we were most concerned about since last December on the oilfield services side have stayed pretty consistent, and so we're not seeing deterioration beyond what our sensitivity testing led us to believe last December.", "And in fact, if anything, we're seeing improvements where lines are being reduced much more quickly than we thought, private equity has come to the fore much more quickly than we thought. And there's just been a tremendous amount of capital that has entered the oilfield service space just as there has been that has entered the reserve-based lending area. So, if anything, we've seen more favorable trends than negative trends through two quarters.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities", "Okay. That's helpful, Scott...", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "And none of that favorable, by the way, would temper our conservative posture towards what we believe will happen in terms of some additional deterioration between now and the end of the year.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities", "Right, right. But you still think though in terms of the reserve that you've got the ability to reallocate more likely versus having to add materially to the reserve?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "We believe that.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities", "Okay. And then separately, in terms of the energy balances, I know you had indicated about a $100 million to $200 million in incremental declines that you could see there by the end of 2015, so that's in total? That's on a quarterly number, that's in total, right, by the end of 2015?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yes.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, that's a...", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. In total the \u2013 the total energy balances ought to be down about $400 million for the entire year.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities", "Right. Okay.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Should be between $400 million to $500 million.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities", "Got it. Okay, good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Just a question on your mortgage-backed securities purchase plan, it looks like your average balances were about the same at the period end. So, I was just wondering if you can just give us an update on that kind of two plus two plus two (43:06) outlook and your paces of purchase relative to what's happened in the rate environment?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I think, if you're looking at the available for sale line on the face (43:17) of the financials, I think what you're \u2013 what you may be seeing is, some of that growth has been masked by the sale of the CDOs. We \u2013 as discussed previously, we expect to maybe accelerate or decelerate those purchases over time and, as our view of rates changes, I would say, and I think I said here recently, that my expectation would be for the next several months at least, and perhaps the next quarter or two, we're going to see perhaps a slightly faster pace of additions to both mortgage-backed securities and swaps than perhaps you would've seen, certainly in the first quarter?", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "And specifically within that, are you biased at this point to do more in MBS versus swaps? Is there a way you can kind of help us understand how that will look, balance sheet versus just income statement effect from the swaps?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "I don't think we're particularly biased one way or the other. I think we are putting a little more into cash than swaps currently, but we don't have a \u2013 I wouldn't say that we've developed a very strong view on one versus the other.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then your reinvestment yields, just any color kind of front book, back book, kind of how you gave us on the loan portfolio?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Well the \u2013 I'll tell you in swaps, we're focusing in sort of the three-year to five-year part of the curve and on MBS, we're looking at fully amortizing either 5/1 ARMs or 10-year pass-throughs.", "Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, got it. Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I was just curious, you mentioned earlier new production and as a follow-up, just some questions on loan growth. I guess I'm just curious to think about, ex-energy, how you feel about the Texas geography in terms of its potential for some growth, or if you feel like the economy there is just too stifling for that to be kind of a net growth area for you?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. This is Scott. And we \u2013 loan demand has softened in Texas, and so they will be up year-over-year, but it will be modest there. And if you looked at the end of last year, they were up about \u2013 and really the last couple of years, $700 million to $800 million each year-over-year, and that number will probably still be up by the time we get to the end of 2015 year-over-year, but it will be a much more modest increase, probably in the $100 million to $200 million range.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. And then just a follow-up to that, what's kind of your strongest growth geography at this point, in terms of where you guys think you'll get your best opportunity?", "James R. Abbott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and External Communications", "We're seeing \u2013 actually Texas was down for the month, or for the quarter rather, as you might imagine and Utah actually had some fairly strong growth. All things \u2013 it was not a strong growth quarter for the company overall, but Utah experienced about a $35 million increase overall. And that is despite a, probably about $120 million reduction in the national real estate group, which has been an ongoing run-off portfolio for several years now, and Arizona also has been a strong consistent growth franchise.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "And as Harris noted earlier, I would just say that it's \u2013 everybody is very focused on just kind of core C&I growth, core one-to-four family, kind of the private banking piece, professional executive lending, those are the three real drivers for us, and the good news is, that's what we've done for many, many years. So, it's not a new \u2013 not a new area to focus on.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. I appreciate the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.", "Gary Peter Tenner - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks, guys. Actually, Brett just asked my question.", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "All right.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.", "Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You noted strong fee income growth looking at both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and I'm wondering, any of the changes made in connection to your efficiency initiatives last month, was any of that put in place in Q2 and, if not, are you feeling better about some of the growth in some of those businesses going forward?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Right. So, the strength we've seen the first six months of the year is really coming in our treasury management business, which represents about 30% of our fee income and it's the business, as you know, where we have national recognition, and have for some time. The other real drivers have been mortgage, our mortgage business is experiencing real nice growth again, and the rest of our credit card business is experiencing nice growth. And then we are seeing customers being much more willing to engage in interest rate hedging than they have over the last two years or three years. So we've seen some real growth there. The \u2013 and so, those trends have been evident, really, for about the last nine months.", "As Paul noted, all of which has been offset to a certain degree by the softness in NSF and commercial loan commitment fees, but the institution of one executive in the company, Jake Heugly, to focus entirely on fee income has been a terrific addition. It's raised the constant visibility and dialog across the whole company about not just driving our core fee businesses, but just looking for other revenue and pricing opportunities. And so, I would just say that \u2013 that is new, it is different, we announced it earlier in the year, and it's having a very positive impact.", "Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.", "And then just as a follow-up...", "Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'd add that the card business continues to be a really good grower for us as well.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "And card represents about 20% of our $500 million in fee income.", "Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.", "And then, have you discussed publicly your branch strategy where you see your branch count going? And I saw the small branch gain, obviously, in this last quarter and didn't know if we should expect more branch divesture, sales and gains going forward?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "We did note in our June 1 announcement that we would be trimming our branch number a bit over the next 12 months and I wouldn't describe it as anything other than just normal trimming that you would do. We have about 450 branches plus or minus depending on when you measure it and, at any particular time, we're going to be trimming that collection of branches as well as introducing new locations as well.", "Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Moran with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Hi.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "I think, Scott, you mentioned that the energy book was about 20% criticized at the end of the quarter, could you remind us where that went to at the peak of kind of the last cycle?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. Quite frankly, we really haven't quoted that number that far back. I'd have to sort of (51:36).", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "Might redirect. As you can see on classifieds, it reached about 20%.", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Right.", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "And that's the number that criticized is very, very broad definition, of course, for what is in criticized, but classified is a little bit more refined, and that reached about 20% and, on a comparable basis, we were at 11% today. Our own outlook for it has moderated a little bit from where it was in December. We believe that that number will not reach what we thought it would reach back in December. So things have gone a little better than what we had expected at that point in time.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up to a question on Texas sort of broadly and maybe it's for Michael or Scott, but just anything else flashing kind of yellow or red at this point in metrics that you guys are looking at? I know that there's been a lot of concern, particularly in Huston, on multi-fam and CRE, so any color that you can give us there?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Sure. On the CRE side, obviously, we're watching multi-family and office there very closely. Our office construction portfolio is very \u2013 I would describe it as modest in size. And the office term loan portfolio is performing well there. And on the multi-family piece, we've had about five, six multi-family transactions that have come out of the construction period and they're achieving rents that are actually above the pro formas, but we will see softness there as the portfolio continues to mature and I would say that of our multi-family portfolio, about 45% of that is outside of Houston in Texas.", "And the economy in Houston in general, you're going to see, my guess is some job growth in Houston this year year-over-year. It's not going to be 80,000 to 100,000 Houston's been averaging the last couple of years, but you'll see 10,000 to 20,000 in job growth. You'll see housing starts that will approach 30,000 and \u2013 but clearly, office vacancies, well, there will be softness there and there will be softness in multi-family, but we think our real estate portfolio is about $1.5 billion less going into this downturn than it was going into the 2009 downturn. And the amount of land A&D was about \u2013 it peaked at $980 million in 2008-2009. That land A&D portfolio today is about $100 million. So, the mix of the portfolio \u2013 the size of the portfolio is very different than the 2008, 2009 experience and the mix is exceedingly different.", "Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Scott. I would only add that our going in underwriting on a cost basis on both multi-family and office of those projects that are under construction still. We're very strong in multi-family side, 35% to 40% cash equity; on the office side, 30% to even 50% cash equity. So we've always been very focused on skin in the game from our clients and both of those asset classes that Scott described have very strong underwriting metrics going in.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Perfect. That's really helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Brassard with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Oliver J. Brassard - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. All my questions have been answered. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Hi. Just one from me, in the $150 million NII sensitivity for a 100-basis point increase in short rates, could you remind us what your deposit volume and beta assumptions are in that $150 million? And how that compares to the last time we saw the short-end of the curve rise?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer", "Erika, pardon me. This is Paul. I think we provide some pretty good and transparent disclosures in our 10-Q. And in there, you can see our estimates around the \u2013 what we're assuming are the duration of the deposits. So implied in that is a significant re-pricing for example of a zero interest-bearing demand deposit into interest-bearing sources. So, we haven't provided any specific guidance as it relates or disclosure as it relates to betas. I would say that our beta assumptions are generally consistent with what others have disclosed and I would direct you to our disclosures in the Q, which I think are pretty good and transparent as it relates to the assumed duration of our deposits, given the fact that we've got so much of our deposits in zero interest-bearing demand.", "Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS. Your line is open.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "Hello. Just maybe one quick one on energy, just wanted to get a sense for how you guys do the price deck and in the redetermination? Just thinking about whether there's a difference \u2013 whether there would've been a different result with energy \u2013 with oil prices now down to $50 as compared to where they \u2013 closer to $60 where they were at the end of the quarter and how that kind of gets integrated into your methodology?", "Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Right. Good question. And we \u2013 basically, our price deck for oil is around $50 right now and we did not rate \u2013 and it has a term aspect to it, but it may go from like $50 to $54 over a term period. But when oil prices went up to $60, we didn't change it. And we generally try to keep our oil price deck at about 90% of NYMEX and so we certainly could've changed it. But we wanted to see a little bit longer period of strengthening and I'm glad we did, because quite frankly, we haven't \u2013 we didn't \u2013 we experienced some softness here in the last 30 days. So \u2013 but back when that redetermination started, which was in April, that's really the price deck and we apply it to the entire redetermination process. We wouldn't switch it in the middle of the redetermination cycle.", "James R. Abbott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and External Communications", "David, that price deck is displayed on slide 29 at the Barclays Investor Conference slide deck, which is posted to our website if you're interested.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "Great.

This webcast is being recorded.", "I will now turn the time over to James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations.", "James Abbott", "Thank you, Sabrina [ph], and good evening everyone. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2015 earnings.", "Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "A fully copy of the earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at ZionsBancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer session. During that sessions we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris Simmons", "Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you as we discuss our third quarter results.", "On Slide 3 of the text presentation are some key points, and several of these are highlights or initiatives that are working well and within expectations. There are a couple of areas that still need some improvement, and I'll touch on a few of these in my remarks. But as an overarching comment, I would say that I'm very encouraged with both the pace of the improvements and the very substantial nature of the projects on which we are working, all of which are designed to help produce return on equity that is considerably strong than our recent -- stronger than our recent results, as well as to maintain strong asset quality and to enable the Company to be more nimble at adapting to a rapidly changing banking environment which in turn we expect will drive solid and sound growth.", "So the first thing I'd mention on Slide 3 is the charter consolidation efforts are working well. As I mentioned in the press release, we've received regulatory approval to consolidate our seven subsidiary banks under a single national bank charter, and we expect to complete that on December 31st this year.", "And in addition to regulatory approval, many of the tasks that need to be accomplished are tracking well, and I'm pleased with the work of a lot of groups within the Company that are working hard to make this happen on schedule. We will continue to emphasize our locally oriented leadership structure and the power of our strong local brands in each market we serve. We really believe that's the strength of the Company. We're simultaneously streamlining our risk and credit organizations and enhancing the local credit decision-making authority that we have out in the field.", "On Slide 4, we're introducing a new scorecard graph with the bar on the left illustrating the commitment to achieve $120 million of gross cost savings by 2017. The bar on the right illustrating the projected progress to be achieved by yearend.", "We are on track to achieve half of the targeted cost reductions by yearend. And I would note that our subsidiary banks are already exceeding 50% of their total aggregate goal.", "We are encouraged with the achievement of non-interest expenses at or below the $400 million level. For the quarter, our commitment is to hold that line item adjusted for certain restructuring costs to below $1.6 billion for the year. We are spending considerable time preparing the Company to continue to realize the remainder of the gross cost savings and to keep non-interest expense below $1.6 billion in 2016 as well.", "I would direct you to Slide 5. Another key measure of our commitment to shareholders is to reduce the efficiency ratio to 70% or below for the second half of 2015. And we're encouraged with the achievement of an efficiency ratio of just under 70% in the third quarter. We are reiterating our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio of 66% or better in 2016, as well as those other targets that we first communicated on June 1st of this year.", "On Slide 6, we highlight the progress that we've made and expect to make with regard to our systems upgrade. I'd invite you to read this in its entirety, but the high-level summary is that we are broadly tracking in line with our schedule, we are making significant investments to provide a very strong technology foundation for our future investments that will simplify our operating environment and give us the ability to be highly competitive in an industry where digital capabilities and technologies generally are going to play an increasingly important role. There is simply a very substantial amount of work that is taking place to keep all of this on schedule and on budget.", "On Slide 7 we display some information with respect to our loans and deposits. The loan growth rate is below our targeted objective. We're working to improve in that area. Some of that is due to the attrition of energy loans, which have historically been a meaningful contributor to growth. However, during the past year, that portfolio has obviously declined substantially due to the decline in commodity prices and the resulting decline in borrowing basis and general activity in that sector.", "I mentioned earlier that our risk management practices are curbing our appetite for the incremental higher-risk deal, and we expect that the benefit of this decision will manifest itself with tempered credit quality metrics and credit costs during any period of future stress, and ultimately in the form of a lower cost of capital as a result.", "Deposit growth, shown in the chart on the right, has been a strong story for Zions for many years, and the source of that growth has come primarily from the most valuable source, non-interest bearing deposits. Although the ratio of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits may certainly be expected to decline somewhat in a rising rate environment, the intrinsic value of those deposits should increase at an even faster rate and thus provide a lift in the economic value of equity and a very substantial increase in earnings, as that happens.", "With that brief overview, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul to review the financial results. Paul?", "Paul Burdiss", "Thank you, Harris, and good evening everyone. I'll begin on Slide 8.", "For the third quarter of 2015, Zions reported earnings of $84 million or $0.71 per share. Although there was some noise that was detailed in the press release, which I'll point out in the call, the noise largely cancels out and we believe that the third quarter reflects a good platform for growth.", "Relative to the prior quarter, after adjusting for the one-time loss related to the sale of collateralized debt obligation securities, earnings per share were unchanged from $0.41 per share. Relative to the second quarter, net interest income was largely stable. Fee income, after adjusting for items such as securities and asset sale gains, was also generally stable. Non-interest expense declined to less than $400 million and the year-to-date result is tracking to below the $1.6 billion target even before adjusting for items such as severance.", "Looking at the provision for loan and lease losses, we had expected a moderate build in the reserve for energy loans, partially offset by continued reserve release in the rest of the portfolio. The elevated provision of the third quarter was affected by elevated net charge-offs. Although we do not expect the forward one-year net charge-offs for energy loans to remain at the elevated third quarter level throughout the period, we do expect some further charge-offs as the energy industry's financial condition continues to develop, and those charge-offs are likely to be somewhat lumpy due to the larger average size of those loans.", "Details of our investment portfolio are shown on Slide 9. We have been adding securities to our investment portfolio for the last year or so, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in light of the new liquidity coverage ratio rules, and more broadly, in order to manage balance sheet liquidity more effectively. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments.", "Well, when we began this program, we indicated that we were targeting a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities of about $6 billion to be accumulated over a period of two to three years. During the third quarter we accelerated the purchases somewhat as we added a net $670 million on average to our available-for-sale investment portfolio when compared to the second quarter. In light of a general market expectation for rising short-term interest rates, we are exercising caution in how much potential revenue due to asset sensitivity we forgo as we purchase fixed-rate investments and how much duration extension risk we take in the investment portfolio.", "The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over three years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is about 2.6 years to date, and if rates were to rise by 200 basis points across the curve, our model indicates that the duration of the entire portfolio would only modestly increase to 2.7 years. Importantly, the addition of these fixed-rate investments did not adversely impact the asset sensitivity of the Company, as shown in the table at the bottom-right of that slide.", "Turning to loan growth on Slide 10. Net commercial and industrial loan growth is about 4%, excluding the effect of energy loan attrition which we have accomplished without an adverse change in underwriting standards. Meanwhile, construction land development loans have increased about 17%. Most of this growth is attributable to increased line utilization on commitments. We manage loan concentrations based upon commitment levels relative to capital, both base [ph] and adverse, and as a result, we have limited commitment growth on CMD loans. We are continually reviewing concentration levels as well as portfolio statistics such as loan-to-value levels and we feel comfortable with the quality of the growth we have experienced.", "Residential mortgage continues to be a focus, although production in this category is significantly impacted by the shape of the yield curve. The two portfolios that have been in decline for the past year or more are the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio.", "The national real estate portfolio represents about 6% of loans, and the attrition here resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point in the overall growth of loan portfolio during the last year. We are currently expecting that the national real estate portfolio attrition would remain fairly high, although perhaps somewhat slower over the next year than in the past year.", "The energy portfolio attrition is well-documented as we have discussed this very regularly during the past year, and our outlook remains consistent. We expect continued attrition as our clients actively work through the current environment for energy prices. We expect the rate of decline to taper slightly, although possible factors such as resurgence of capital market activity in the space result in a fair amount of variability in the range of our outlook. To summarize, our outlook and loan growth for the next 12 months is for a slightly to moderately increasing portfolio, which would be in the low to mid single digit rate of growth range.", "On Slide 12, this provides more detail on loan yields. Specifically, the coupon on new loan production versus the total portfolio, which we believe is helpful in understanding the risks due to yield on loans in the current interest rate environment.", "The yellow line reflects the GAAP loan yield on the portfolio. The primary reason for its decline is the previously mentioned impact related to loans purchased from the FDIC. Importantly, the weighted average coupon of loan portfolio has been stable over the past couple of quarters. The coupon of course excludes the effective amortizing fees, discounts and premiums. The yield on new production declined 9 basis points from the prior quarter, essentially due a shift mix in production to somewhat larger loans in the third quarter when compared to the second, although not shown in this chart, the coupons in the various loan types and size cohorts were relatively stable with the exception of larger loans which remain under pressure. Although our loan officers are seeing some pricing pressure in the smaller loans space, our production coupons have been stable.", "Touching briefly on non-interest income and non-interest expense, our focus on fee income growth is generating good traction. I'm confident that the increased reporting and accountability that we have added to better track success in problem areas within [ph] fee income will result to materially stronger fee income growth than we have experienced in the past. And Harris has already discussed our non-interest expense and efficiency efforts, so I won't repeat them here. I will provide our expectations for non-interest income and non-interest expense when we come to our 12-month outlook summary.", "One more item of note on the income statement. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 7 points lower -- 7 percentage points lower than our typical effective tax rate. This is due primarily to investment tax credits realized this quarter related to alternative energy and research and development. And all the effective tax rate was positively impacted by nearly $1 million of these one-time items in the third quarter. We expect our effective tax rate to be closer to a more traditional 35% going forward.", "Slide 11 breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 4 basis points from the second quarter to average 4.18%. Although there were various positives and negatives, the one that stands out as the primary driver of the overall loan yield decline was the decline in interest income related to loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009. That portfolio has substantially outperformed relative to our expectations at that time. However, in the third quarter, the income was more in line with our modeled expectations, which resulted in a decline of income from those loans from approximately $12 million to $7 million.", "This adversely impacted loan yields by about 5 basis points and reduced the net interest margin by about 3 basis points when compared to the second quarter. Our base case scenario for this pool of loans is that annualized earnings that we experienced in the third quarter, that level, will taper slightly as we move forward.", "The securities portfolio yield declined this quarter due largely to the changing composition of portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk. Shown at the bottom of the chart is our cost of funds as a percent of earning assets, which continues to be quite competitive. In addition to loan portfolio yield -- in addition to portfolio yield dynamics, the net interest margin was also adversely impacted by the shift in the mix of the balance sheet toward greater concentration of cash and securities, which carry a lower yield than the loan portfolio.", "Turning to credit quality, on Slide 13, I'll be brief and say that we continued to experience generally strong credit quality performance in most geographies and segments. Within the C&I segment is most of the energy which we have discussed -- as we have discussed, has experienced some stress, and Scott will discuss that next.", "Our reserves for credit loss is quite strong at 1.6 times our non-performing assets and nearly five years of debt charge-offs based on the third quarter annualized results. Despite the increase in classified energy loans of just over $110 million from the June 30 level, overall classified loans increased only $30 million in the third quarter.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending in the Houston market more broadly.", "Scott McLean", "Thank you, Paul. And if you'll turn to Slide 14, you'll see the table that we also show on our earnings release, and let me just take -- let me just make some summary comments.", "First, you'll note that the decline in energy loan outstandings and commitments and the classifieds have increased by approximately $118 million from June 30th. Both trends are as we had forecasted earlier in the year.", "Second thing you'd note is that, we have indicated before that we have a number of methodologies we're using to project potential charge-offs, as noted previously, these various methodologies are still guiding us to an estimated energy losses of $75 million to $125 million for the cycle. A very manageable number given the overall size of our Company.", "Although not on this slide, we have previously indicated in this release a continued build of our energy loan loss reserve to a level above 4%, a strong reserve, we believe, by any comparison.", "As for charge-offs, we experienced in the third quarter, they're generally related companies that have been troubled since the last downturn and they're not really indicative of the underwriting we've been doing since the last downturn.", "The next slide, Slide 15, frames the discussion about the Houston economic environment. The takeaways from this chart would include the fact that Houston has been one of the strongest job growth markets in the United States for years. In 2015, job growth is projected to be flat or possibly up by 10,000 to 20,000 jobs. You can see that, generally speaking, Houston has been generating anywhere from 80,000 to 110,000 jobs a year for the last four, five years. And that trend will slow to really a level of flat this -- for 2015.", "Also while the mood among business owners is conservative today, as noted in the PMI chart, many other indicators such as housing, new car sales, hotel performance, all remain healthy, which may be at least partially attributable to the strong $20 billion plus in capital investment that's going into the petrochemical refining and LNG export sectors of the Texas Gulf Coast economy.", "If you turn to Slide 16, drilling down into our commercial real estate -- the commercial real estate trends in, again, Houston. We do see some uptick in vacancy levels in office, both for multi-family and retail, two sectors that we have most of our other exposures and the vacancy levels are holding steady. Clearly, multi-family vacancies though will increase over time and rental rates will be under pressure. However, our multi-family projects that had been in lease-up during 2015, and it's approximately two-thirds of our multi-family portfolio in Houston, are experiencing rental rates above the levels estimated in our base case during the underwriting process.", "Turning to Slide 17. Slide 17 shows an updated view of our exposure to commercial real estate in Texas. The darker left-handed side of each bar represents the Houston exposure, which has increased somewhat from the prior quarter due to various factors, including new originations, conversion to term CRE from construction, as the buildings have reached that service level that is consistent with our term commercial real estate underwriting standards, as well as draws on existing construction commitments.", "We have a very conservative loan-to-value ratio and debt service coverage on the construction and term commercial real estate portfolios in Houston, and we expect this conservative underwriting to be a strength during this downturn. But obviously this is a situation that bears close monitoring, as we've discussed in the past. While I'm happy to talk about our exposure to specific product types, there are some keys to our commercial real estate exposure in Texas which are worth mentioning.", "When comparing our Texas exposure today to the 2008 downturn, there are several important factors that position us more conservatively today. They include, first, the fact that commercial real estate balances are about $1.2 billion less today than 2008 and our exposure to land is approximately $150 million today compared to approximately $950 million in the previous cycle. And this land exposure is well-seasoned and represents very little underwriting since the previous downturn.", "Secondly, we've also trimmed our construction lending exposure and we've emphasized an increase sort of pivoted to term commercial real estate originations. Generally speaking, the amount of equity required in office in multi-family construction financing is significantly greater today as well than in the previous cycle. We'd be happy to talk about those elements as well.", "Paul, I'll turn the call back to you.", "Paul Burdiss", "Thank you, Scott. I'll conclude our prepared remarks on Slide 18. This reflects our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter.", "On loan balances, we are maintaining our slightly to moderately increasing outlook for loans, due primarily to the factors already discussed today. On net interest income, we are maintaining our outlook for net interest income at moderately increasing, it does not include the effect of any rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect to benefit -- a benefit to annual net interest income of about $125 million for each 100 basis-point move in short-term rates.", "We expect that non-interest income, excluding dividends and securities, gains and losses will increase moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. One note as we consolidate the charters, dividends from federal agencies, namely the Federal Home Loan Banks, will decline, and of course there's a relatively new risk that dividends on our Federal Reserve bank stock would also decline depending upon congressional action. But even with those headwinds, we are generally comfortable with the level of consensus.", "As stated previously, we are committed to holding non-interest expenses to less than $1.6 billion for both 2015 and 2016, excluding severance and restructuring expenses. We remain comfortable with our flat to slightly positive outlook on the provision, assuming energy prices remain relatively stable.", "As mentioned after -- as announced after the close of the market today, we expect to deploy up to $180 million of cash to tender for a portion of our preferred -- perpetual preferred stock and depository shares outstanding. This includes the tender premiums and accrued dividends, thus the paramount retired is expected to be less than $180 million. Ultimately we expect this action to reduce preferred dividend by about $10 million going forward.", "James Abbott", "Thanks, Paul. And Sabrina [ph], at this point in time, would you open the line for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]", "And our first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Hello everybody.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Just maybe one on energy and a follow-up. Scott, could you just share with us what the criticized [ph] balance was of energy loans in the quarter?", "Scott McLean", "Yes. Criticized outstandings for the total energy portfolio were about 23%.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Twenty-three percent.", "Harris Simmons", "It was -- I would just add --", "Scott McLean", "It was about 20% last quarter.", "Harris Simmons", "Yeah, it was about 20% last quarter, so, about $60 million or $70 million linked-quarter increase.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. Scott, just to follow up on your comments, I found them interesting, the $75 million to $125 million of losses through the cycle. Could you give us a sense of the probability of default and loss given default assumptions or at least maybe ranges? Because your numbers are a little bit lower than what we're thinking. What's underlying that?", "Scott McLean", "Well, basically there's four methodologies that we've used, fundamentally. And one was our CCAR [ph] estimates, which basically had oil at about $50. And then we had a second methodology which was a credit-by-credit analysis, so it was a very bottoms-up review based on the specifics of each credit and their current grade and all the aspects of each one. So it was very much a bottoms-up analysis.", "And then the two final types of analyses we've done. The first was taking the worst loss year we had, which was approximately 1% for a 12-month period, and applied it over a nine-quarter period. So we took our worst annual loss and assumed we had that same loss rate for nine quarters. So we're assuming kind of a U type experience here as opposed to the V which we experienced in 2008-2009. Nine quarter also tracks, obviously, nicely to the CCAR [ph] methodology.", "And then the final version was we took our worst classified experience ever and we applied an aggressive loan loss rate to that. The four of those really triangulate around $75 million to $125 million.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining-Sparks. Your line is now open.", "Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks", "Thanks. I was -- one, to focus in on the period-end on the securities versus the average. The average was up about $650 million, but the period-end available for sale was up $1.4 billion. So it seems like there's some pretty significant hangover going into the fourth quarter to get some benefit there.", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah, Marty, this is Paul. Thank for your question. That's exactly -- you characterized the numbers correctly, which is that we were growing the portfolio over the course of the quarter. So the ending ended up being about twice the average. And to your point, I would expect that ending balance to carry into the fourth quarter, with continued growth from here.", "Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks", "The mortgage-backed premium amortization, you highlight that, you didn't really put an impact around net interest margin. How much of that impact the quarter's margin?", "Paul Burdiss", "It wasn't -- the amortization itself was not a big impact, Marty. It was about --", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I think it's about 2 or 4 basis points.", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah. I think it's about 3 basis points, Marty.", "Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks", "Okay. And with the income from the FDIC loans, James, was that also offset in the expenses? So, was it kind of a move from net interest income to favorable expenses?", "James Abbott", "It's a good question. The impact on the non-interest expense was fairly insignificant actually. So I think we dropped half-a-million or $1 million in non-interest expense as a result of the reduced income from FDIC-supported loans. But -- and the absolute level of money that we're sharing with the FDIC, I think for the quarter was $1.5 million, Marty. So it wasn't a very substantial amount, the non-interest expense number.", "Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks", "Okay. And lastly, the $75 million to $125 million, just realm kind of park, how much of that has already been provided for, you know, just in percentages? What do you think you kind of got your hands already in the reserve? And thank you for the time today.", "Scott McLean", "Well, the reserve I mentioned was north of 4% and energy outstandings are about $2.8 billion. So it's -- the reserve is to the high end of that range.", "Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks", "Thanks.", "Scott McLean", "If not above it.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Darst of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.", "David Darst - Guggenheim Securities", "Yeah. Hey, good afternoon. Just around your original CCAR [ph] expectations of about $300 million of preferred redemption, you're doing $180 million now. Would you expect to do some more in the first half of 2016?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah. We've got -- this is Paul -- we've got through June of 2016 to complete that $300 million. So we're doing the total cash value of $180 million today, and I would expect the balance of that to come in the first half of 2016.", "David Darst - Guggenheim Securities", "Okay. And then just as far as the $10 million reduction, how much of that -- is that here in the fourth or is that going to be the -- kind of the full run rate in first quarter 2016?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah, I wouldn't expect to see that full run rate until the first quarter of 2016.", "David Darst - Guggenheim Securities", "Okay. And then just on your provision guidance, for flat to slightly positive, so that's not off of this $18 million this quarter, is it? That's still off zero, right?", "Scott McLean", "It's off of zero, that's a good clarification. Thank you.", "David Darst - Guggenheim Securities", "Okay, got it. Okay, thank you.", "Paul Burdiss", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "Hello. Thank you for taking the question.", "On the 66%, sub-66% efficiency ratio target for 2016 and the low 60s for 2017, clearly you're sticking with that. But is there any shift in the makeup between revenues and expenses given that loan growth seems to be coming in a bit lighter than expected but maybe do more on the revenue side, on the expense side, to offset that?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah, I would tell you that we, you know, I think we still expect to see a little better loan growth as we go into 2016. But the fact of the matter is we're starting with a smaller portfolio than we thought we would have coming in to 2016. So I expect that we're going to have to be working very hard on the cost side.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "And then just following up, fees you're now talking about a slight to moderate growth rather than moderate growth previously. So what's changed in the thinking there?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, I think we've got some headwinds, as I discussed in my prepared remarks. We've got the charter consolidation is going to lead to lower dividends from the Federal Home Loan Banks and then we've got this other potential Federal Reserve Bank dividend headwind to talk about. So we're just -- we're moderating our outlook in light of some of these other factors.", "Harris Simmons", "And Paul, I don't know if you want to go into a little detail on the Federal Home Loan Bank dividends and the fact that we have so many Federal Home Loan Bank memberships and --", "Paul Burdiss", "Certainly we can talk about that if there's interest. We've got -- because we've got several banks under the FHLB rules, you know, a bank belongs to the district that it resides, with the charter consolidation, we're going to have one bank, CBNA [ph], that's going to be based here in Salt Lake City, and as a result, our [inaudible] Federal Home Loan Bank shareholders' relationships and shareholdings will be collapsed into -- or consolidated I should into one Federal Home Loan Bank, and that will be the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines.", "And as a result, the way the FHLB system works is there are minimum share ownerships for each bank, and those minimum share ownerships will go to zero among these other banks, and as a result, we're just left with less, fewer shares of FHLB stock, and therefore dividends will be just lower.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you.", "First question. Scott, if I heard you right, I think you mentioned something about, we were talking about the energy deterioration that -- that the credits [ph] were deteriorating, and I think it was right to say they were bad credits or they were credits that you did last cycle or last downturn, they were not the credits that you would have underwritten since the last cycle. But I guess my question is, how much of the portfolio that you currently have, the $2.8 billion, actually relates to the last cycle, the borrowers from -- that might be a little more at risk than what you would have done now?", "Scott McLean", "Ken, thank you. You did hear me correctly, the charge-offs have fundamentally been borrowers that were weak in the last cycle, they've been kind of limping along, and for whatever reason, you know, we have not been able to get totally out, and this recent downturn was just kind of another very difficult blow to them.", "But I would say, most of the underwriting, you know, we have sort of adverse selection in there, when you think about those transactions we charged-off, and there are just some you can't get away from, so, no matter how hard you try. And -- but I would say most of the portfolio is largely based on the underwriting that we've been doing, you know, we -- for the last four or five years.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. Okay. And then the other question, just for Harris. When you think about loan growth, obviously it has come in a little bit weaker. I know you guys want to improve that, but how much flexibility or how much I guess different initiatives or incremental incentives can you offer to actually better loan growth? Or is it that you are just subject to the environment that you're in?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, it's clearly both. It's -- but there are tangible steps that we're trying to take to, you know, trying [ph] to understate within a very disciplined view about how we manage risk around here. I think that, you know, I for one have a concern that we may find ourselves set [ph] into another downturn before we see the economy strengthen a great deal again, I mean. So we're trying to be very careful.", "But we are, for example, we've hired some additional mortgage loan officers. So we're out there with some additional feet on the street doing that. We are really working hard at kind of looking at the process internally for getting loans turned around, particularly smaller business loans and consumer credits, to get a better pull-through rate. So there are things of that sort that we are doing that we think don't compromise quality in any meaningful but that can help us amp up growth a little bit. But it is a tough environment.", "We're also trying to be reasonably disciplined around pricing. I think we've got a really good pricing culture in the Company and discipline around that. And so we're trying to be careful. I mean, sometimes you have to cede some ground competitively, but that's at play as well in terms of being able to grow your portfolio. So, trying to balance all of those.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Understood. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Harris Simmons", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba of SunTrust Robinson & Humphrey. Your line is now open.", "Michael Young - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Hello, this is Michael Young in for Jennifer.", "Just had a question again on loan growth. You know, energy bank was about half of the loan growth sequentially this quarter. Can you just talk about your outlook, if that's, depending on energy and Texas being a little bit weaker and growing slower there ex the energy component, or do you expect a lift in some of the other areas to pick that up?", "Harris Simmons", "I would expect some lift in some other areas. One thing -- one of the things I would note about Texas is, I mean, the -- outside of Houston, things remain in reasonably strong shape. And so, I think it's, you know, I don't count Texas out as a place that we could see some growth in non-energy related growth. But the offset to that is going to be what happens in the energy portfolio down there.", "Elsewhere, I expect that -- we've got some pretty good economies that we're working in. And the, you know, the prospect for growth, we're seeing growth in Colorado, we're seeing it in Utah, we're seeing it in California, and other markets that we're in. So I remain generally sanguine about what can be done in terms of loan growth.", "Scott McLean", "Just on a linked-quarter basis, I would just -- I'm not sure if this was the question -- part of the question. But of the $89 million worth of loan growth that we had for the quarter, energy actually experienced attrition of about $42 million. So the pockets of growth for the quarter anyway were Zions Bank, had about $52 million, California had about $117 million. Those were the two standouts on the strength, on the strong side.", "Paul Burdiss", "The -- one other thing I might mention about loan growth is that, I mean, we've had [inaudible] energy but also out of this national real estate portfolio, kind of low loan-to-value small business credits of commercial mortgages. And we're trying to -- we are looking at how we can slow down sort of the payoffs. We're seeing a lot of refinancing in the CRE book in the term portfolio. Everyone's trying to lock in long-term fixed-rate money, and so that's another area that we'll be focused on, is, you know, if there are ways that we might be able to slow that down a little bit, that would actually really help on the loan growth side.", "Michael Young - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, great. Thanks for that.", "And just one other question on the energy loan portfolio. Could you provide a breakdown of the classified loan percentages by type of -- like by buckets there I guess?", "Scott McLean", "Sure. This is Scott. The upstream classifieds are about 22%. Midstream about 5%. Energy services about 18%. Total energy 15 - 16%, sorry.", "Michael Young - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, great. That's all for me.", "Scott McLean", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Kevin Usdin - Jefferies", "Thanks. Good afternoon.", "Paul, first question, on the $6.6 billion of securities portfolio versus your original $6 billion goal, so, are you -- how much more are you now planning to build on top of that? And the premium amortization pickup that you mentioned, that's just related to the portfolio build as opposed to it being a one-time item, correct?", "Paul Burdiss", "A lot of the -- I'll start with the last question first -- a lot of the amortization pickup is related to portfolio build, although within the portfolio we've seen some accelerated prepayments in, for example, Ginnie Mae ARMs that were originated before 2015, because of the change in the government fee program that occurred in January. But by and large, you're right, I mean proportionally, most of the pickup was related to the pickup in the size of the portfolio.", "As it relates to portfolio size, we're going to continue to monitor that relative to our cash position. As you've noticed, we've continued to grow the portfolio but our kind of overnight money market position hasn't changed a whole lot, because we've continued to see a lot of demand deposit growth, which has been a very positive story. So we're going to continue, as it makes sense, we're going to continue growth in the AFS portfolio.", "Kevin Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. And my second question --", "Paul Burdiss", "Sorry, I would remind you that that $6 billion includes a lot more than just mortgage-backed securities, right?", "Kevin Usdin - Jefferies", "Absolutely.", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah.", "Kevin Usdin - Jefferies", "You mentioned -- we know about the debt reductions that one you did in mid-September and one that's coming mid-quarter. So I just want to understand, on Slide 18 you talked about the $8.6 million interest expense incurred. Is that what's going away from here, of it? Or I just want to understand, like what is the go-to long-term debt run rate versus the kind of, it looks like, $18 million, $19 million, you put -- you paid out around this quarter?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah. The $8.6 million we quote there is the expense we incurred in the third quarter related to the two pieces of debt that are going away. One went away in September 15th and the other goes away November 16th. So, mid-September and mid-November. And as you know, these had rates on them approaching kind of combined 15%, 16%, and just under $250 million. So that's kind of how that math all comes together.", "Kevin Usdin - Jefferies", "So, both -- $8.6 million will be gone in the first quarter completely?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes.", "Kevin Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay, got it. Just wanted to make sure on that. Thanks a lot.", "Paul Burdiss", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "Hey, good evening.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Good evening.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "You guys have addressed most everything, but did want to follow up just on the credit. I guess this is the -- you had a small amount of recoveries in the quarter, maybe smaller than the previous quarters. Do you think you've pretty much run your course on kind of elevated recoveries going forward, just kind of curious kind of maybe what offsets you might have against maybe some additional credit costs related to energy?", "Harris Simmons", "I guess I would say that there are still a few rabbits now and then that jumped up and out, from the crisis era, but they will become fewer and farther between. I do -- I mean I'm aware of a couple probably we'll see in the next six months that are meaningful. But overall it's going to be lumpy and it's going to generally be trending down.", "Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is now open.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "Good afternoon.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hey, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "Back to credit, on that 75 to 125 in projected losses. At the high end that implies about a 4-1/2% cum loss through cycle ratio, and that's only modestly higher, if I'm correct, than your 2008 loss experience on a cumulative basis, which was about 3%. So, is that 3% correct? And then secondly, it's only modestly higher, I'm just thinking this through, it seems like -- I would think that it would be a good amount higher than the 2008 cycle.", "Scott McLean", "Well, the, you know, our -- what we said is that our losses inception to date, so, from 1997 until the beginning of this year, call it 17 years, was $60 million net charge-offs. And so there's about 3% I guess depending on what period you want to measure it over. But this loss rate -- this loss rate by any measure would be certainly higher than what we experienced. So we really weren't relying on that historical loss experience. We took it into consideration, but we also used a, as I said, a 9-1/4 duration to these loss methodologies.", "So I mean, it's probably worthy of a longer answer, but there's -- I guess what I'm saying is that the $75 million to $125 million reflects a greater loss rate than we've experienced historically.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "Okay. All right. And then separately on the capital front. Would just want to get your thoughts on how a lot of these actions you're doing on the balance sheet and, you know, are impacting your position for CCAR [ph]. In other words, you're putting the cash to work, you paid down the -- or you punted the CDOs, you're paying down debt. And then you also have the change going to Basel III under the 2016 CCAR. So, how does that all position you from your perspective for 2016 CCAR [ph]? And has there been any changes to that estimate of that impact of all that stuff given some of the changes in the economy or in the rate environment and oil?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah. John, I wouldn't say that our overall outlook has changed. I mean we'll see what the economic scenario looks like when the CCAR [ph] instructions come out. But to your point, we've done -- we've really tried to do a lot of things that we think will set us up well in the CCAR [ph] environment.", "You know, the only countervailing influence to all the positive things is energy. I mean energy is kind of a question-mark with respect to kind of where commodity prices are going to go, but maybe more importantly, how the Federal Reserve is going to be treating that as it relates to their assumptions -- their economic assumptions in the CCAR [ph] scenario. So it's very, you know, it's very difficult to predict an outcome, as you know, with CCAR [ph]. But to your point, and I think you've made a lot of good points for me, we're doing a lot of things here to really control our own destiny as it relates to CCAR [ph].", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "Okay. Thank you.", "James Abbott", "John, I think I might just chime in a little bit, and maybe ask Scott to talk about some of the differences in the way that we've -- loans that we have on the books today in the energy portfolio versus ones that we had in the 2008/09 timeframe, second lien, the presence of second liens would be one that comes to mind immediately.", "Scott McLean", "Sure. No, James. So we had some second lien financing going into the 2008/09 downturn, we have zero today. Secondly, there was a trend then going in, in the 2007/08 timeframe, where reserve-based borrowers were accessing the capital markets for really quite significant levels of junior debt -- junior capital, and to $200 million to $500 million, $1 billion tranches of senior unsecured subordinated debt, etcetera. So, total leverage was much higher.", "We started to pull away from that just before the downturn in 2008, but we had more of that as did the whole industry in that downturn. And in this cycle, we've stayed away from that phenomenon pretty -- in a pretty diligent, disciplined way. And I will tell you that that tendency started coming back into the market all throughout 2014, a little bit of the second half of 2013. And so I think it's a good thing that we were able to stay away from transactions like that in this cycle.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yeah. And I think we've said it publicly before but we'll say it again, we essentially [ph] exited several loans during the 2014 timeframe that had --", "Scott McLean", "That had that characteristic. And I would also note that we, in terms of things that we're continuing to do, you know, our fundamental underwriting on oilfield service is -- had proved itself up to that last cycle, we've stayed very true to that discipline, and the private equity firms that we work with that we've commented on before, it's about six to seven private equity firms on the reserve base side, six to seven on the oilfield service side. They're the same group of private equity firms we've worked with, in some cases for 10 to 15 years. We were -- it's the same group that went through the last cycle that's going through this cycle with us. And so that is a real positive, because they supported their credits last time, generally speaking, and we've already seen them supporting their credit this time, although every cycle is not the same. But these are people we have strong relationships with.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford of RBC Capital Markets.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi, Joe.", "Operator", "Your line is now open.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Great. Scott, I was just curious if you could give us a little color on how the redetermination process is going so far relative to your expectations, and did that affect your reserving much at all this quarter?", "Scott McLean", "Joe, thanks for the question. I wish I could give you a real definitive answer, but the process is literally just starting. The deck we'll use this time will be about $45 on the short periods, and then as you know, we follow the curve out. It's a little flatter curve this time than the $50 deck we used in the spring. So that's a fundamental difference.", "It'll be late November, early December before we fully captured all that. Our sense is, we saw our borrowing basis decline by about 11%, 10% in the spring redetermination. There's been a lot written about that, actually some of which has been pretty accurate, in terms of the industry, as to what will happen this time. They -- my sense is we'll see borrowing-based declines in that same range, 10%, probably north of that, for this go-around. And it could be 10 to 20, but my guess is it'll be on the kind of mid-teens declines.", "And there are reasons for that, but -- anyway, it's all still to come. But I will tell you that none of, to answer your question, none of the current redetermination had an influence on our additional provisioning in the third quarter; however, we did go back and looked at our spring redetermination where the sensitivity case was $37.50. So that we had all our borrowing basis measured at 37.50 and we did focus in on that a bit harder. This was when, you know, prices were down around 40. And that guided us a bit on the additional provisioning we did in this quarter. Prices are now back up a bit. So, anyway. But we did look at 37.50 very carefully, and in this redetermination we'll be using sensitivities that are below 37.50.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Right. Okay, understood. That's helpful.", "And then, Paul, I guess the other question for you, is just there is some discussion about the FHLB dividends, and I just wondered if you could quantify what those fees that may be lost and what's the timing of when that -- we might see that hit the income statement.", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah. Timing is probably we'll see that in the first quarter. And I'll have to think about -- I'll work with James on disclosing on the dollar value.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Understand. Thank you.", "James Abbott", "Okay. We have -- Sabrina [ph], I'm going to interrupt you here just a second. We have six questions left and we have five minutes left. So we'll go lightning round, one question per person, and then we'll try to go very quickly at this point.", "Operator", "All right. Our next question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS. Your line is open.", "David Eads - UBS", "Good afternoon. I will take that message here.", "So, can you just give a little color on sort of the lessons learned from the review of the oilfield services portfolio this quarter, and kind of thinking about what that -- what changed in terms of debt to EBITDA ratios or [inaudible] coverage, just kind of what you learned there and whether you think there's going to be more headwinds to that portfolio the next few quarters.", "Scott McLean", "Sure. And you're saying lessons learned this quarter?", "David Eads - UBS", "Because that's what's impacted, you know, that was the bigger issue this quarter, correct?", "Scott McLean", "Well, yes. But we said since last December that you would see oilfield service classifieds build in principally the third and the fourth quarter. We said you would see a little bit in the second quarter. This was all the way back to last December, we saw very little oilfield service move in the second quarter. We said back then it would happen in the third and fourth quarter, and so it is. And that's principally just based on the fact of when you receive financial statements, and there was a positive hangover from the end of last year in terms of activity that was going on for oilfield service companies. So I would say no real lessons learned in this quarter, it's exactly the way we thought it would play out.", "I would say though that I'd be really careful, as banks quote debt to EBITDA numbers, you know, EBITDA numbers are going to be going down, those debt to EBITDA numbers are going to become really almost a useless statistic, because they'll be eye-popping. They wouldn't be anything you'd underwrite at. It was just going to be because of the vanishing EBITDA, so.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "And a couple, as we mentioned, David, a couple of the charge-offs were related to companies that were really stale, had been around for a long time and struggled. So it was -- it's -- yeah.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "And they were very close to the drillbit on the energy services side.", "David Eads - UBS", "All right. Thanks. I'll move along.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR. Your line is now open.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Yeah. Thank you very much. On the -- when you guys hand in your CCAR [ph], do you have -- is there higher rates factored into it? And we've heard a couple of companies say that they might have to back off some of their capital management because rates now are -- a lot of people are assuming now rates are not going to rise. Can you add some color on that?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well, I would say that our capital actions were pretty conservative in the last CCAR [ph], and I would not say that they were overly impacted by the prevailing rate environment in the Fed base case, which I think is what you're getting at. I mean we've got the dividend increase which you've already seen and then we've got the redemption, the tender of the preferred stock, which we're in the process of doing. And I would not expect the prevailing rate environment versus the Fed base case to impact that.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "Hey, good afternoon guys. Just real quick back on the provision guidance. Not to split hairs too much here, but you're saying you're guiding to flat to slightly up from zero, but we're at $18 million this quarter. So it kind of sounds like you guys are effectively guiding for that provision to be lower from here. Is that right?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah, David, that's -- it's a good point of clarification. We -- the intention for the provision going forward is flat to slightly positive rather than flat to slightly positive from $18 million. So in other words, zero to $10 million to $15 million per quarter, something in the area of what we're thinking at this point.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Spahr of CLSA. Your line is now open.", "Chris Spahr - CLSA", "Thank you. This is related to what Ken asked earlier. The available-for-sale portfolio, the yield is 185. Given the emphasis on HQLA securities, do you expect that to go down lower or stabilize now?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, that's going to be a function of the yield curve ultimately. But look, we're buying securities that have a yield that is in that kind of 1.50% to 2% range generally, is our either ARM products, like Ginnie Mae ARMs or pass-throughs of -- or 15-year pass-throughs. So it's in that -- it's going to be in the ballpark. But again it's going to be a function of kind of where rates go from here.", "Chris Spahr - CLSA", "So, all else equal, it might -- so, all else equal, it might be slightly lower but not the 14 bp delta that we saw this past quarter?", "Paul Burdiss", "Look, hard to predict, but yeah, I would expect it to start to level out.", "Chris Spahr - CLSA", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of John Moran of Macquarie. Your line is now open.", "Chris Spahr - CLSA", "Hey. Thanks. Just a real quick question on the nature of the energy charge-offs this quarter. Do you have the split for RBL versus OFS? Because if I'm remembering correctly, the $60 million since inception, almost of that was RBL, which was a little bit counterintuitive.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "So, acronyms -- we got an acronym problem here. But OFS -- oilfield services and RBL is reserve-based lending for the uninitiated.", "Chris Spahr - CLSA", "Sorry about that.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yeah. No, that's fine.", "And I would say, virtually all of this was oilfield services.", "Chris Spahr - CLSA", "Virtually all the 17 this quarter were -- that was services, okay.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes.", "Chris Spahr - CLSA", "And then the expectation on the -- I'm sorry, I'm going to sneak a follow-up here -- the 125 being the top end of the range, how much of that do you think comes out of services versus reserve-based?", "Scott McLean", "You know, John, it's so hard to tell. I mean it was counterintuitive that, of our $60 million inception to date going into this year, $1 million was services, $59 million was reserve-based. If I had to speculate, it's going to be probably 70-30 oilfield service to reserve-based, maybe 60-40. It should tilt more to oilfield service. The longer this goes, the heavier the tilt and -- to oilfield service. And the lower prices. You know, these estimates are fundamentally for oil in a price range of $50 to kind of high 40s, up to $60, if we see prices dip back down into 40s or the 30s, we could see numbers north of what we've described. But we currently believe that high 40s to 60s is what we'll -- what we should experience.", "Chris Spahr - CLSA", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "James Abbott", "And we've got one follow-up from Paul.", "Paul Burdiss", "Yeah. Sorry, if I could follow up on the question about Federal Home Loan Bank dividends.", "We reported or recorded a little under $5 million in FHLB dividends in 2014. So that'll give you an idea of the scale of that revenue that would be going away in 2016.", "James Abbott", "Thanks, Paul. And thank you all for joining. This concludes our call at this point. And we really appreciate you joining the call. I'll be around for a little while this evening if you have follow-up questions. You're welcome to give me a call or an email. And we look forward to seeing you at a conference in the future or on the next quarterly earnings call. Thank you again for your participation.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "James Abbott", "Thank you, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2015 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that during this call we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in this press release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "A full copy of the earnings release will be -- as well as a supplemental slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We\u2019ll be referring to the slides during this call. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer session. During that time we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris Simmons", "Thank you, James, and welcome to all of you who are on the call today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. There is obviously a lot of focus on energy and we\u2019ll talk about energy as we get further into the presentation, but I wanted to talk about a variety of things that we think are actually working very nicely before we get to that.", "From Slide 3 and the related slides that we\u2019ve distributed, we\u2019ve tried to highlight some of the initiatives that are working well and are within our expectations. I\u2019ll touch on a few of these in my remarks here, but as an overarching comment, I would want to say that I\u2019m quite encouraged with the positive operating leverage that we achieved in the quarter. The positive revenue trajectory, the stable expense levels, and the solid progress that we\u2019ve made on the technology projects that we\u2019re pursuing.", "We are highly focused on improving the profitability and growth profile of the Company and we made very tangible progress in 2015 towards those goals. Additionally, despite the weakness in energy commodity prices, we were able to maintain strong overall asset quality metrics and we experienced an encouraging improvement in the rate of loan growth compared to the prior quarter during the fourth quarter here.", "On Slide 4, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the third quarter, we experienced improved loan growth in the fourth quarter of $536 million or about 5% annualized. Excluding the effects of expected energy loan attrition loan growth was more than $700 million or about 8% annualized. We were pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth specifically non-energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans.", "Deposit growth shown in the chart on the right has been a strong story for Zions for quite some time and the source of that growth has come primarily from the most viable source, which is non-interest bearing deposits. The value of those deposits should increase as rates rise and should lead to a strong increase in earnings if and when interest rates further increase. Thus far, we\u2019ve been able to hold deposit rates quite flat.", "Turning to Slide 5, the most significant source of revenue for Zions is net interest income, which equals about 78% of the fourth quarter net revenue. Although a portion of the increase from the prior quarter was driven by interest income recoveries that may not occur in the first quarter of 2016, we expect the interest rate increase in December will offset that factor. Also, driving net interest income higher was the increase in both loans and securities, as well as a material reduction in the interest paid on debt. Accordingly, we expect we will experience similar if not slightly higher net interest income in the first quarter of 2016.", "On Slide 6, we\u2019re encouraged with the results from the initiatives we\u2019ve made to grow fee income. Managed fee income increased 4% from the 2014 year and we\u2019re targeting a stronger growth rate in 2016. Managed fee income is defined by us as income sources we manage directly and excludes the effect of dividends, securities gains and losses, and other similar sources. The most significant increase in 2015 was from treasury management, which increased 13%. It also happens to be our strongest contributor to total fee income. Some of the headwinds include loan fees, which were down due in part to soft demand for energy lending, as well as overdraft fees, which is attributable at least in part to strengthening consumer balance sheets.", "On Slide 7, we have the cost savings initiative scorecard graph, with the bar on the left illustrating the commitment to achieve $120 million of gross cost savings by the end of 2017. The bar on the right illustrating the cost saves that were accomplished in 2015. We remain on-track to achieve the targeted cost reductions by 2017 having already realized more than half of the goal by the end of 2015. We\u2019re encouraged with the achievement of holding non-interest expense to less than $1.6 billion in 2015. Additionally, our commitment is to hold that line item adjusted for certain restructuring costs to below $1.6 billion in 2016. We expect benefits in 2016 to include the simplification of operations that are due in part to the charter consolidation.", "Moving to Slide 8, we have achieved a portion of another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which was to reduce the efficiency ratio to 70% or below for the second half of 2015. We\u2019re encouraged with this achievement, and we are reiterating our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio in 2016 of 66% or better, as well as those other targets that we first communicated on June 1st of last year.", "On Slide 9, we\u2019re satisfied with the progress we have made on our technology projects. The general ledger transition and new reporting tool conversion are complete. The credit approval workflow system software is installed in most of our banks with the completion scheduled for the spring of this year. The same is true for the enterprise loan operations. We are tracking to a spring completion.", "Regarding our core systems replacement project, which we\u2019ve dubbed FutureCore where we\u2019ve partnered with Tata Consultancy Services we are expecting the consumer loan system to rollout later this year with commercial lending tracking for 2017 and the deposits module scheduled for 2018. In summary, we are making significant investments to provide a very strong technology foundation for our future. These are investments that will simplify our operating environment and give us the ability to be highly competitive in an industry where technology is obviously playing an increasingly important role.", "Finally as noted in the press release, the consolidation of our seven subsidiary banks to a single national bank charter was completed on December 31st. We\u2019ll continue to emphasize our locally oriented leadership structure and the power of our strong local brands in each market we serve, but we\u2019ll find some additional efficiency from this consolidation of charters. We\u2019re very optimistic about the future operational and financial performance for Zions.", "With that brief overview, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?", "Paul Burdiss", "Thank you, Harris, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter of 2015, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $88 million or $0.43 per share. Relative to the third quarter, net interest income increased about 5.5%. Adjusted for recoveries of interest income and a linked-quarter increase in income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased just under 3%. Actively managed non-interest income, which excludes investment-related items and securities gains and losses increased slightly from the prior quarter and as Harris noted earlier, increased about 4% for the full year 2015 when compared to the full year of 2014.", "At just over $400 million, non-interest expenses were higher in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter due in part to elevated levels of expenses in certain categories as detailed in the press release, which accompanies this call. We are encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allowed Zions to realize our goal of adjusted non-interest expense of less than 1.6 billion for 2015.", "Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses, we had expected a moderate build in the reserve for energy loans, partially offset by continued reserve release in the rest of the portfolio. Although throughout most of the quarter, we expected the provision for loan losses to be in line with the third quarter result, the decline in the price of oil near the end of the quarter resulted in a moderately higher provision. The energy loan portfolio continues to perform about as we had expected. As we progress through 2016, we expect quarterly provisions to be moderately higher than the fourth quarter results. The key driver of our expectation for an elevated provision in 2016 is the lower prevailing energy prices, actual results may therefore vary from expectations if energy prices remain volatile.", "Finally, I would like to highlight the return on tangible common equity. Although we're working to drive shareholder returns to a much higher level, I'll point out that our efforts over the past year have resulted in a better than 100 basis point increase in shareholder returns when compared to the same period a year ago, while capital levels have actually increased slightly during the period.", "Turning to Slide 11, I'll address some of the drivers of the net interest income beginning with volume. Details of our investment portfolio are shown here on Slide 11. We have been adding securities to our investment portfolio for the past year or so, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively in light of the recently established liquidity coverage ratio rules.", "Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments, when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the fourth quarter we added $1.5 billion to our investment securities portfolio on average when compared to the third quarter. In light of a general market expectation for rising short-term rates, we're exercising caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity, as we purchase fixed rate investments and duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio.", "The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over three years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is estimated to be 2.9 years to-date. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicates that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to about 3.1 years. As expected, the addition of these fixed-rate investments reduced Zions\u2019 asset sensitivity somewhat as shown in the table at the bottom-right of the page. Worth nothing, the deposit beta assumptions employed in our slow case are in fact faster than we are seeing in the market today or in plain language, our slow scenario model assumes faster deposit re-pricing than we're currently observing in the market. So the improvement in the net interest income from the December rate hike could and likely will be higher than that shown in the table on the Slide 11.", "On Page 12, we breakdown year-over-year loan growth. Overall, we're encouraged with our fourth quarter loan growth despite some headwinds, as Harris mentioned earlier. Compared to the prior quarter, period end loans grew at a little over 5% annualized. Net commercial and industrial loan growth for the last year was about 6% when excluding the effect of energy loan attrition. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth without an adverse change in our underwriting standards. Year-over-year net churn commercial real estate growth was about 8% when removing the effect of national real estate portfolio.", "Residential mortgage continues to be a major focus for growth across our geographic footprint. The other category experienced healthy growth from various subcategories such as home equity and municipal lending. The two portfolios that have been in decline for the past year or more of a national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio, the national real estate portfolio represents about 6% of loans and the attrition here resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point to the overall growth of the loan portfolio during the past year. The rate of decline is slowing for this portfolio and it currently accounts for less than 50% of tangible common equity.", "The energy portfolio attrition is well-documented as we have discussed this regularly during the past year, and our outlook remains consistent. As we expect continued attrition as our clients actively work through the current environment for energy prices. To summarize, our outlook on loan growth for the next 12 months is for a slightly to moderately increasing portfolio, which would be in the low-to-mid single-digit rate of growth range.", "Another key component of net interest income, which is the yield or rate on the portfolio and loan production can be found on Slide 13. The slide based on key components of our net interest margin. The top-line is the loan yield, which increased 6 basis points in the second quarter to average 4.24%. As described in the press release, it was a recovery of interest income of about $8 million, included in the fourth quarter loan yield, excluding this recovery the loan yield on the portfolio declined about 2 basis points from the prior quarter.", "The securities portfolio yield declined slightly this quarter, largely due to the change in composition of the portfolio, as we had new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk. As the bottom of the chart is aligned depicting our cost of funds as a percentage of earning assets which continues to be quite low and declined slightly from the prior quarter due to the reduction of high cost subordinated debt. The net interest margin increased to 3.23%, a 12 basis point increase from the third quarter. If adjusted for the income recovery, the net interest margin would have been about 3.18%. This increase is largely attributable to the change in earning asset mix, more loans and securities in the fourth quarter and less cash, as well as the previously mentioned, reduction of high cost subordinated debt.", "Slide 14 provides more detail on loan yields, specifically the coupon, our new loan production versus the total portfolio, which we believe is helpful in understanding the risk to the future yield on loans in the current interest rate environment. The yellow line reflects the GAAP yield on the portfolio. The primary reason for its increase is the previously mentioned interest recoveries. Importantly, the weighted average coupon of loan portfolio has been stable over the past couple of quarters. The coupon of course excludes the effect of amortizing fees, discounts and premiums. The yield on new production also stabilized in the fourth quarter, as we saw the yield on larger loans improve somewhat in December, reflective of the move in LIBOR. Although, our loan officers are seeing some pricing pressure in the smaller loan space, our production coupons have been stable.", "Turning to credit quality on Slide 15, I'll be brief and say that we continued to experience generally strong credit quality performance in most geographies and segments, with a notable exception of energy-related loan which are included in our C&I segment. Our reserve for credit loss is quite strong at just under 1.7% of loans, which is nearly two-times our non-performing assets and over a decade worth of charge-offs based on the fourth quarter annualized results. Despite the increase in classified energy-related loans are just under -- I'm sorry, just over $76 million from the prior quarter level. Overall, classified loans increased to only $45 million or 3% in the fourth quarter.", "Non-performing assets declined slightly from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs declined due to recoveries, which were $32 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross charge-offs were relatively stable when compared to prior quarter. Our outlook for 2016 net charge-offs is between 30 and 35 basis points of average loans. The majority of these charge-offs are expected to be energy-related.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and the Houston market more broadly.", "Scott McLean", "Thank you, Paul and I'll start on Slide 17. We've not repeated the table that we have in our earnings release on Page 4 of the earnings release in this -- in the main section of this slide deck, although it can be found in the Appendix, but let me just make some summary comments.", "As noted in the press release, energy loan outstandings and commitments declined fairly substantially from the prior quarter and from a year ago. We commented that, we believe this would happened throughout 2015, the decline in outstandings was about 450 million compared to a year ago and commitments are down approximately $1 billion since a year ago. Classified energy loan balance has increased by approximately 76 million from the prior quarter and finished at a level that is actually somewhat better than what we would have expected a year ago. Non-accrual energy loans declined from the prior quarter primarily due to net charge-offs, which is not the way you want to reduce that bucket, but it's important to note that the level does not increase much if you adjust for net charge-offs.", "Turning to Slide 16 -- let's see it's not Slide 16, it is probably Slide 17. Yes, or is it okay, I am sorry. Yes, as we noted since late 2014, we have been extremely active in managing the energy portfolio, including the full attention of our entire executive team reviewing the portfolio frequently on a credit-by-credit basis, plus significant interaction with our customers. Based upon that input along with our models, we are updating our outlook for energy loan losses. As noted previously, these various methodologies led us to estimated energy loan losses of between 75 million to 125 million for the nine quarter period ending the fourth quarter of 2016. That was estimated more than a year ago, based up on oil prices near 50.", "It is obviously considerably -- the price of oil is obviously considerably lower than that today, with most of that decline occurring during December 2015 and January 2016. So it's appropriate to provide an update to that loss expectation. Assuming $30 per barrel for the next several quarters, we estimate that energy loan losses will be between 75 million and 100 million in 2016. This is on the high-end of the initial range, but it's been driven by the decline in the oil and gas prices relative to the initial expectation. And as Paul just mentioned, we expect total losses for the Company to remain manageable with net charge-offs ranging between 30 and 35 basis points for the entire consolidated portfolio. We continue to build our energy loan loss reserve to a level above 5%, this is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations that we've reported in the past and that have been reported by our peers.", "Yes, on Slide 17, we are providing some additional disclosures on trends in the various major types of energy credits with the orange line representing upstream or exploration and production loans, the green line representing energy services and the yellow line representing all other energy-related loans. On the left is the trend in balances outstanding, despite the capital markets being somewhat quiet in the fourth quarter, we still experienced a substantial decline in balances as borrowers continue to sell assets and use cash flow to reduce debt.", "On the top right is the trend in classified energy loans by subtype, with services increasing during the fourth quarter, while classified E&P companies experienced a decline in that quarter. Non-accruals are shown at the bottom. We expect continued downgrades, but we expect that the situation as noted before will be manageable. On Slide 18, we show an updated view of our exposure to commercial real estate in Texas. The darker left hand side of each bar represents the Houston exposure. The point of this slide really is that Houston CRE portfolio is diversified across a variety of asset types, product categories and we are not concentrated in any one particular area with very minimal exposure to land.", "Slide 19 is new disclosure for us, which shows the commercial real estate portfolio by cash flow and collateral support. You'll notice that there's very little in the way of tail risk. Property values could decline or cash flow could decline substantially and very few properties would run into substantial trouble. While I'm happy to talk about our exposure to specific product types, there are some keys to our commercial real estate exposure which are worth mentioning. When comparing our Texas exposure today to the 2008 downturn, there are several important factors that position us much more conservatively today. They include first, that our total commercial real estate balances are approximately 1.2 billion less today than they were going into 2008 and our exposure to land is down more than 80% from what we saw going into the previous cycle. Additionally, our mix of construction lending and CRE term lending has shifted much more to CRE term. Generally speaking, the amount of equity required in office and multifamily construction financing is almost double today what it was going into the previous cycle of 2008.", "With that as a bit of a backdrop Paul I'll turn the call back over to you.", "Paul Burdiss", "Thank Scott. Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months, relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our slightly to moderately increasing outlook for loans, due primarily to factors already discussed earlier in our comments. Over the next four quarters, we expect net interest income to increase from the fourth quarter level. We anticipate continued loan and security growth and additional benefit from December's slight rate increase, which will outpace the headwinds of one fewer day of interest income and no anticipated large interest income recoveries.", "Our outlook does not include the effective of any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect to benefit to annual net interest income of about $100 million for every 100 basis point increase in short-term rates. We expect our quarterly provision that is moderately higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, assuming energy prices remain near current levels. We expect to maintain a strong reserve ratio on energy loans. We expect the non-interest income excluding dividends and securities gains and losses will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this line items. As a reminder, if dividends from federal agencies namely the Federal Home Loan banks will decline due to a charter consolidation. You may recall we have multiple memberships to several Federal Home Loan banks and we're consolidating those to a single federal home loan bank and due to the FAST Act which is more commonly known as the Highway Spending Bill and its impact on dividends from the Federal Reserve.", "Non-interest expense as stated previously and we are committed to holding the non-interest expense to less than $1.6 billion for 2016, excluding severance and restructuring costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 4 basis points lower than our typical effective tax rate. This is due primarily to investment tax credits realized this quarter, relating to alternative energy and research and development. We expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 34% in 2016 which may fluctuate somewhat due to how much of our investment in technology projects is eligible for tax credits. We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline, the tender offer completed in the fourth quarter reduces preferred dividends by approximately $10 million annually, although the amounts are uneven. For example assuming no changes to the outstanding preferred equity from today, the first and third quarter dividend rates are expected to be 112, I'm sorry $12 million each and the second and fourth quarters should be approximately $15 million each.", "This concludes our prepared remarks, Sabrina would you please open the line for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Your line is now open.", "Jennifer Demba", "Could you guys, it\u2019s a very healthy capital ratio. Just wondered if you have any interest in share repurchases once we get through CCAR given your stock has taken quite a hit in the last several weeks?", "Harris Simmons", "I would tell you that I would certainly expect so. We have not developed the capital plan that will accompany our submission of our stress test and through the CCAR process, which is just getting underway. But we would expect to be more aggressive than we\u2019ve been, certainly in the last cycle in terms of what we\u2019ll hope to accomplish in the way of capital returns. And that I expect that would be on the table, Jennifer, but obviously that\u2019s we are aboard to contemplate and determine in consultation with the management team here and then it goes through the CCAR process, but that\u2019s what I would sort of expect we will be doing.", "Jennifer Demba", "And just one additional question on the energy portfolio, Paul, could you just kind of elaborate how much of the reserve you guys have is qualitative versus quantitative for the energy portfolio?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well Jennifer, I think as you know that\u2019s not something that we typically disclose as Scott said, however we do believe we have a healthy reserve at over 5% of [bank] [ph] loans.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.", "Brad Milsaps", "Scott, I was going to see if you give maybe a little more color on the pay downs that you did see in the energy book during the quarter. Just kind of what the nature of those were, are you starting to see any evidence of PE money, other energy companies buying out others, just trying to get a sense of kind of where the pay downs could go and where you\u2019re -- those are stemming from?", "Scott McLean", "Sure Brad, no, good question. Actually the pay downs are coming much more, they are more heavily weighted to the services portfolio, number one. Number two, you\u2019re going to see a natural contraction in the reserve base outstandings as the redetermination came down during the quarter. The borrowing bases were re-determined down we saw some natural payoffs there. But those would be the two primary areas. And we saw continued term amortization, recall that on the services side of our portfolio about 35% of the portfolio is term, it\u2019s amortizing on a little less than a five year basis. And so we\u2019re continuing to see reductions there. And then the last comment I would make is that during the year, we had approximately $140 million of capital contributed by private equity firms and that didn\u2019t all go to support reductions, but it, a portion of it did. And additionally, we saw about 150 million in loan commitments reduce as a result of restructurings that we did. So really it\u2019s across the board and it\u2019s all pretty healthy type reductions that you would anticipate.", "Brad Milsaps", "Okay. And then just one follow-up, I know you\u2019re using $30 per barrel to drive your charge-offs expectations for the year. Just curious kind of where you guys are in terms of your price deck in terms of and where you are for the redetermination numbers coming in at the end of the year?", "Scott McLean", "Yes, the current price deck is in the low-30s and then obviously it goes up from there. But the current low-end is about $32, our sensitivity case for 2016 drops down to $24, so that\u2019s -- we\u2019ve had about 11 price deck reductions over the last I\u2019d say 12 to 18 months.", "Brad Milsaps", "Great, thank you.", "Scott McLean", "And you\u2019d see the same sort of conservative nature on the natural gas pricing as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Ken Zerbe", "First question, just in terms of the investing of the cash into securities, could you just walk us through the thinking, like what changed in your minds, I mean, I know we had the rate hike, but it doesn\u2019t seem like security yields would have been all that much higher now versus say a month or five months ago? Why get more aggressive with security purchases? Thanks.", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes, this is Paul. I assume when you say more aggressive, just there was a slight acceleration in the fourth quarter relative to what we\u2019ve seen previously, is that correct?", "Ken Zerbe", "I was thinking like the 1.6 billion that I think I saw referenced for the full year.", "Paul Burdiss", "Okay, yes. I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in saying that over the course of two to three years, we would be investing approximately $6 billion of cash into the investment portfolio. And the timing of that may change. So I wouldn\u2019t say that there was any particular view on the yield curve, but we are trying to be somewhat thoughtful about the timing of those investments. But looking forward I would expect to continue kind of in the range or the pace of the purchases that we have been making.", "Scott McLean", "I think it's also just fair to say that I mean we just continued to see growth in deposits, and particularly non-interest bearing deposits and so that\u2019s facilitated a little faster build up.", "Ken Zerbe", "And then just as the follow-up on Page 16 in terms of the energy loss expectations of 75 million to 100 million over the next four quarters, I know we\u2019ve been in the energy crisis I guess for some time. But just in terms of the path of losses, all right, we\u2019re talking about the losses over the next four quarters though with oil at $30 today, are we more likely going to be look into 2017, obviously we have the reserves build now, but are we more likely to see even higher losses in 2017, I am just trying to understand the default path of the energy companies?", "Scott McLean", "Ken, it\u2019s obviously very difficult to estimate what 2017 would look like. The price decline in the last month has been last 30 day has been very similar to last year, in terms of magnitude and we\u2019re obviously at a different level. And so all that pushed us to say that we would be at the upper-end of the range that we originally stated for 2016, and I think what you\u2019ll look for us what you can look for us to do is mid-year we\u2019ll have a better sense of how long this is going to last and what portion of the \u201917, but if, to answer your question very specifically, if prices did stay in this current level through 2017 you\u2019d probably see losses in \u201917 of about the same magnitude that we\u2019re suggesting for 2016.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining-Sparks. Your line is now open.", "Marty Mosby", "I wanted to ask you just about as you look at the discount that\u2019s kind of evolved into your stock price, I would say that you\u2019ll calculate the earnings power as a cushion for potential losses. And I just want to make sure I\u2019m getting this right. If we look at pre-tax on our earnings cushion, you have about 125 million per quarter and that would relate to about what you have right now in energy reserves, which represents 5% of the portfolio. So if you look at each quarter, you\u2019re generating in excess of another 5% before you would ever get into a capital, so be it kind of hit, to the capital position versus just reducing earnings. So, just wanted to you to kind of talk a little bit about earnings cushion and the potential losses in energy?", "Scott McLean", "I think you\u2019ve done a very nice job. I think first we start with a very strong capital and strong reserves, not only for energy but across the portfolio. And the rest of the portfolio continues to improve. I mean energy is the only place we\u2019re seeing stress. So, I think we feel like the risk of any real capital need, any external source of capital are going to be very it is just not on the horizon of anything we expect to happen at the present time.", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, in the guidance we gave on a 30 to 35 basis points of net charge-offs is again very manageable in the sense of our overall capital generation and that assumes a pretty pejorative outlook for the energy sector. So, you do have to -- once you move away from your analysis of energy, you have to look at how energy sits inside our total financial structure. And as you noted and Harris noted it, there is a lot of balance there.", "Scott McLean", "There is a lot incremental capital being generated each quarter just with the earnings power you have now. And then Paul the other I would find to really look at is before the stock price guidance to a discount, such a discount that it is now I thought dividends would be kind of the focus. But once you get this bigger gap, share repurchase becomes so valuable. Has the change in stock price changed the way you would just, not asking about the level that you\u2019ve asked for, but maybe your priority with share repurchase being a bigger priority now where the stock price is relative to maybe year-end?", "Paul Burdiss", "Again, it could well be -- I mean that\u2019s a yet to have with our Board, but I think we clearly recognize the power of repurchases right now.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR. Your line is now open.", "Paul Miller", "There was an OCC letter CRE exposure and worry -- I think the OCC was a little bit worried about some banks taking exposure there with that concern within are concerned, can you talk that a little bit about how you're dealing with that OCC letter and is it a big concern there at Zions?", "Paul Burdiss", "We\u2019ll have Michael Morris our Chief Credit Officer, speak to that. Michael?", "Michael Morris", "Sure, well the OCC letter focused a lot on multifamily and a lot on the buildup in community banks, especially in multifamily and we feel very comfortable with our multifamily exposure in all of the markets that we're in with the teams that we have in place, with the equity sponsors that we bank. Our average loan to cost in the construction site is around 60%-65%, so that translates into something less than that in LTV, so 55-60 LTV on projects that are still continuing to lease up and stabilize at rents that were either pro forma or in excessive pro forma. So where we see the pressure coming will be on cap rates as overall yields move up, if they do might not being the favorite asset class that it has been, so that could put some pressure on cap rates which would increase some of the value, but we're watching it carefully and we feel good about our exposure.", "Paul Miller", "And do you think Mike where your level of exposure in that area would it have to decline or it could stay where it is?", "Michael Morris", "We think it can stay where it is and go right into a cycle where there might be a little of softness in rent growth and cap rate increase, but we're comfortable where it is. We don't actually want it to pay-off and go out into the capital markets right into the agency side.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of American. Your line is now open.", "Erika Najarian", "My first question is a follow-up to Ken's. Paul you noted the rate of future securities purchases would be similar to what we've seen in the past, but I am calculating 1.5 on average for this quarter as you mentioned and then 6-10 in the previous quarter. Given that this such a powerful NII driver for you, it seems at which -- I just want to get it right, what should we assume for about the levels that of purchases per quarter?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes Erica sorry if I misspoke, what I meant to say was that our purchases going forward would be in the range of what you'd experience so you kind of outlined the range of possibilities, but I would expect to continue to make purchases in that range for at least the next four quarters. And then hopefully they would be sort of somewhat reflective of the opportunity that the market gives us, but if we clearly understand the earnings power of those securities additions and are focused on continuing to deliver that. I should also say that those portfolio additions as I said in my slide comments, we're paying special attention to the duration of the bonds we\u2019re putting on and the extension risk. These are typically agency arms, an agency 10-year final maturity pass-throughs which again have we believe more predictable characteristic as it relates to the extension risk on those additions.", "Erika Najarian", "And if I could ask are those mostly HQLA and could remind us of what your LCR ratio is at the fourth quarter and how you\u2019d expected it to and how you're managing it for this year?", "Paul Burdiss", "Right Erica we're particularly mindful of the LCR and the securities that we're putting on we're adding in the context of HQLA, so either level 1 or level 2 in the appropriate proportions. I don't believe we disclosed our LCR, but I will say that we are comfortably in excess of the requirement.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Joe Morford", "Just wondered if you could give us a little more color to the drivers to the pick in the loan growth in the fourth quarter and any notable geographic trends you saw and related to that also just curious the run-off that you would expect to see in the national real estate portfolio in 2016?", "Paul Burdiss", "Sure, yes the growth during the quarter was -- we saw nice wonderful family mortgage growth across the entire franchise as our mortgage initiative is continuing to mature and we think that will continue into the New Year here and then with basically C&I growth just solid C&I growth above and beyond what is running off in the energy portfolio.", "Joe Morford", "And then the run-off?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes, and Joe the nature of that C&I, those C&I balances, new balances, it is just normal kind of middle markets small business lending that we did\u2026", "Joe Morford", "Right.", "Scott McLean", "And I think if you look on Slide 26, there is a pretty good depiction by geography and types, you kind of see for this, now that's -- this is year-over-year -- but on the national's real estate it has been on 457 for the year it is -- that space of shrinkage has slowed. So we think we're getting closer to a point where that kind of starts to stabilize.", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes, by bank Joe, I would just add a little commentary the Zions bank was little right around the $75 million mark in growth from the prior quarter and California Bank & Trust actually had a really strong quarter at more than almost $220 million worth of growth, energy had good growth, obviously not in C&I because of the nature of the energy portfolio there but in the other categories, it was a good quarter there. So in Arizona like $100 million growth there, it\u2019s just a really diversified growth.", "Joe Morford", "And then maybe just a couple of quick housekeeping things, I wondered if you could just in the expense categories just quantify what the litigation accruals for this quarter as well as for those fees paid out on the DIC investment IPO?", "Paul Burdiss", "We're not going to give you a disaggregation of it impart because we -- it's -- the litigation is ongoing and it's useful stuff not to have to signal what that is in a granular way, so someday we'll come back and answer your question but not right now.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "I wondered if you could talk about credit, ex-energy and how long you think the positive trends that you are seeing there can continue?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well I mean, I guess the short answer is until we see the non-energy economies start to really fray, but we're not seeing that we -- and I don't think we're going to venture a guess as to when the cycle really starts to et cetera, we'll actually do that but I think suffice to say that at the moment we continue to see improvement and even in markets like, in a market like Texas the non-energy portfolio remains very healthy. We are looking at a lot of indicators in each of those portfolios to kind of watching for problems and so far it is not really showing up. So, anything Michael you would add to that?", "Michael Morris", "No, I can't add anything to that, all domains consumer, retail, mortgage, small business, large commercial they all continue to perform well and metrics are all solid.", "James Abbott", "Geoff this is James.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Sorry?", "James Abbott", "Geoff I was just going to direct you to maybe the Appendix Slide 25 and this might be helpful for you. As you look at -- we haven't broken out a lot of information on past loans grade migration in the past but this is a little bit of the FICO score analysis of what's happening both in -- what we've turned as the high oil and gas employment counties, we're going to create a new acronym here, but -- and then everything else and so this is in our consumer book but you can maybe think about this in terms of how consumers are behaving versus small business which is the bread and butter or a bread and butter business for Zions, but you can kind of see the -- at every point from the year ago period, you are not seeing deterioration of any statistical significance in the consumer book and that's the same story that you'd see if you looked at our small business portfolio and middle market portfolios.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Ken Usdin", "Just a couple of more clarifications on credit, so just understanding if the outlook for charge-offs is 30 to 35 basis points, because I calculate that's around 120 million to 145 million or so of charge-offs, and I am just wondering on top of that are you also saying that you'll provide for some loan growth and then is there also potential for additional reserve build, if there is additional deterioration in the energy credits as you mentioned on the slide?", "Paul Burdiss", "Actually we believe with the provision that we've guided you towards that that should fully cover this level of charge-offs and growth in the portfolio.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, so\u2026", "Harris Simmons", "Well again there is quite an assumption there again the quality and the rest of portfolio remains as strong as it is currently or even continues to improve a little bit but.", "Ken Usdin", "Yes, that's why I asked the question because it just seems like if you're saying a 75 to 100 of energy losses than it would seem that you have got about 45 million from other sectors but I'm just trying to understand that breakdown of the reserve bill, the loan growth and then it doesn't seem like to your answer on prior question it doesn't seem like you're seeing much elsewhere as far as lost contents. I was wondering if it was just a summary of those other things and maybe the absence of recoveries?", "Harris Simmons", "Yes I guess the other thing what I would probably add is if we saw loan growth and the resets kind of slight to moderate, and clearly as loan growth surprises the upside that would probably push the provision a little bit higher too. So it's -- this anticipates pretty modest loan growth in getting to that kind of a number.", "Ken Usdin", "And just a quick follow-up on the fee side, this quarter obviously you had the -- it looks like you had some write-downs in the loan sales line but can you also help us understand how much the impact is of the highway bill and the charter consolidation and did that all show up in fees as well?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, yes the point that I was making this is Paul, around the outlook for non-interest income was that these sources of dividends in the past were not going to be there going forward and so for example on Federal Reserve bank stock there's about a $3 million differential there in 2016 relative to 2015 and in federal home loan bank stock it\u2019s kind of in the $5 million to $7 million range. So you're looking at in the aggregate about $10 million of reduced dividends from those sources in '16 versus '15.", "Ken Usdin", "And then just should we start from the 124 reported as the base to grow up slightly to moderately increasing?", "Paul Burdiss", "I would say there were a couple of items in there as you correctly pointed out in your question that averaged the impact of that. I think the right base is probably closer to the third quarter number which is kind of in the 130 range.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Kevin Barker", "Given that the -- some of the securities buyings that you've done over the last couple of quarters and your expectations over the next several quarters, where do you see your asset sensitivity on 100 and 200 basis point move once you fully complete some of the balance sheet restructuring over the next give it a year or two?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes, this is Paul, my expectation is that given our starting point which was as you know we screen very high asset sensitivity, even after taking into consideration the fixed rate asset purchases that we contemplate here over the next year or so, my expectation is that while our asset sensitivity will be reduced we will have converted all of that sort of potential income into actual income. And we will still screen in my opinion on the high-end of asset sensitivity relative to our peers.", "Kevin Barker", "When you say high-end do you have an idea of 200 basis point move will be x percentage or 100 basis point move would be, 4% to 6%?", "Paul Burdiss", "We haven't quantified that, and maybe James and I can work together to figure out what might make sense, but I think if you look at the spread of asset sensitivity around the peers as I said we're still going to be at the high-end of that.", "Kevin Barker", "And then you mentioned that the price decks for oil were down at $32 and the stressed impact was I believe you mentioned $24 in your earlier comments. At that level and if we were to see oil near $24 for the next year or two, do you quantify or have some stress impact for energy losses in that scenario?", "Paul Burdiss", "We actually have four models that we're utilizing at the moment and they cover the full gamut from $20 a barrel up to higher levels and the guidance we're giving for this year fully reflects the potential of a $20 scenario.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay.", "Paul Burdiss", "Which we don't anticipate to happen by the way, but you can't help but study it at that level because we just have a very serious approach to this whole subject.", "Kevin Barker", "Yes, so we don't get there, all right thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is now open.", "John Pancari", "Wanted to see if you could just on the oil price sensitivity wanted to see if you can give us what the sensitivity will be if oil was at $20 by the end of '16 and I'm not just asking that just to have you extrapolate, but I understand that it may not be asymmetrical relationship, it might get much worse as prices fall into the 20s and stay there, so just wanted see if you can help us size that up? Thanks.", "Paul Burdiss", "You know I appreciate the question, but we are -- it is really is a moving target, we\u2019re not going to sort of disclose each one of our scenarios, but suffice it to say that we have evaluated at that level from multiple different approaches. And we believe that again what we\u2019ve forecasted would be well in the range of lower prices.", "Harris Simmons", "And I think the question is there going to be a complete cliff in that process and?", "Scott McLean", "There is generally not a complete cliff. I mean the nice thing about the reserve based lending. Is that it is unlike any other type of commercial lending we do, it is made to adjust on a periodic basis. And it works far better than working capital revolvers, receivables and inventory. And the industry E&P companies, they know how to live within their cash flows generally speaking is doesn\u2019t mean they encounter problems, they will encounter problems. But they know how to ratchet back cash flow and it\u2019s fundamentally comes in the form of controlling their CapEx. But they have many other things to control including the cost that they receive from services companies, which are down anywhere from 25% to 35% in 2016. The other thing as you have probably read about is that just lifting cost, pure cash lifting cost. Depending on the company, depending on the reservoir et cetera, et cetera are generally in the $7 to $12 range, pure cash lifting cost. So there is a lot of datapoints to what I just described to you, but because these revolvers are -- the borrowing bases are re-determined every six months through comprehensive engineering we -- they adjust very naturally, so you rarely run into a pure brick wall.", "John Pancari", "My follow-up is on the commercial real estate portfolio on a linked-quarter basis, the term CRE book was up 4.5%. The first time in a while, you have put out that type of growth in that book. Is that something that is sticky and could you see it continue the growth at that pace or I was just wondering what\u2019s changed that you feel comfortable growing that? Thanks.", "Michael Morris", "This is Michael. I would say that without really digging into the number, that while that growth came from conversion from construction to term. And when that happens it\u2019s a lot easier for that to stick to the books and a lot of easier for us to write near term than it is to go out and originate fresh near-term loans that may not have the kind of risk profile that we want. So we have really put the decelerator on C&D, especially in the multi-family. So a lot of that would be conversion to term, but some of the business units are originating new term. So if we can continue to create a more stabilized CRE portfolio with stabilized income streams.", "John Pancari", "But I guess Paul, I guess from your perspective from the risk weighting that is applied to commercial real estate exposure and everything. I mean does this imply that you\u2019re more comfortable with the exposure now, as it pertains to your capital ramifications or well that is what I am just trying to get at?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, first don\u2019t think we have plenty of capital. But importantly as Michael said, I think what we\u2019re seeing here is a conversion of construction into term CRE. So in the aggregate, I\u2019m not sure that the exit loss profile looks any worse.", "Michael Morris", "And I think it is notable, but I mean if you look at construction, it\u2019s flat over the last year, I mean it came up a little bit, came back down. And total CRE is up 2.3% or something like that. I mean so it is -- I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate from one quarter on the CRE fees.", "John Pancari", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "James Abbott", "Sabrina, we\u2019ve got about five questions left. We\u2019ll have to go to the one question per questioner at this point just to try to, we're already overdue so we are going to try to go through this quickly though.", "Operator", "Sounds, good. Our next question comes from the line of David Darst of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.", "David Darst", "So on the 400 million that you had as loss absorbing capacity in the CCAR with CDOs, is there any risk that are in the upcoming CCAR that\u2019s not enough, kind of curious stress level for the energy book?", "Scott McLean", "Well, it is -- I mean the nature of Fed Reserves models as if you don\u2019t really know. I mean we would certainly expect that there would be nominal if any loss showing in the securities portfolio just around at CCAR. And so I think you are thinking about it may be right way, I mean you sort of have $400 million that you could move to another column to C&I for energy for example. But we obviously don\u2019t know, so at the moment we don\u2019t know what the scenario is going to look like it hasn\u2019t been distributed yet and we don\u2019t know how their models work. So I think it would be speculative on our part to say that we have any better understanding than you probably do about what\u2019s going to come out of that model.", "Paul Burdiss", "Although, this is Paul, I\u2019ll remind you that the operative capital statistic last year was Tier 1 common and the operative statistics this is year is common equity Tier 1. And under the fed\u2019s model last year, we fared much better under the current measure than the former measure.", "David Darst", "All right.", "Scott McLean", "And should show a strong level of pre-tax pre-provision net revenue as well coming in, so a better starting point in that way.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "So my one question is for Scott. Could you give us a sense, what percent of production for your E&P customers which was hedged in 2015, and at what level? And then how is that changing into 2016, both percent hedge and then the new level it will be hedged at? Thanks.", "Scott McLean", "Sure, so the -- let me just sort of give you a broad sense of this. That in -- last year, we indicated that a year ago that generally speaking oil was hedged at around 55% of the current year production and that number is probably about two-thirds of that now for current year production, half to two-thirds. And it\u2019d be similar for gas, the amount of gas hedging was a little less last year than the 55% plus or minus for oil in terms of -- and I am talking about current year production, so it would have been 2015 production, now we\u2019re in 2016, and I am saying that those hedging levels are probably about half of what they were in -- for the 2015 year. And I would also tell you that the way that the borrowing base redeterminations work that is fully taken into account. So, if it doesn\u2019t stop the decline in the borrowing bases, but it's fully taken into account in terms of the present value of the future cash flows.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "And what about the level in terms of where it's hedged at for 2016?", "Scott McLean", "The dollar amount?", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Yes, on average?", "Scott McLean", "So yes, I don\u2019t have that number, I apologize. Let me go back and see what we said last year, I don\u2019t have that dollar amount. And I don\u2019t -- yes we\u2019ll just take a look back at it.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS. Your line is now open.", "David Eads", "A big part of my question John had and I think more from a qualitative standpoint than a quantitative standpoint, just curious if we\u2019ve seen some bankruptcies failed to recently and I know that every borrower is very-very different. But I am just curious if what have we seen recently would cause any reason to change your expectations when it comes to loss severities when you do see evolve?", "Scott McLean", "On the energy portfolio?", "David Eads", "Yes, yes.", "Scott McLean", "Yes. Again these four models that we use are pretty aggressive in terms of the negative assumptions that we use or the very conservative assumptions that we use. So, we believe we have baked that in. I mean it was very different list of assumptions this year than last year and the way we\u2019ve refined our models has been especially helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of Stephens. Your line is now open.", "Terry McEvoy", "Just a quick question, I was wondering if you performed the goodwill impairment evaluation last quarter, last year you did it in October. The reason I ask is about 60% of your billing dollars of goodwill is connected to Amegy?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes this is Paul. In accordance with GAAP, we are required as you know to continually monitor the valuation of the relative components of that relative to goodwill. So, yes in fact we have dutifully performed that in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. Your line is now open.", "Brian Klock", "So, I\u2019ll save my other questions for the Investor Day in a couple of weeks. But maybe ask another way, so on Page 11 in the income statement the other non-interest expense line item. Obviously, there are some things in there that appear to be non-recurring. How should we think about it sort of normalized level for that? Should it be some sort of maybe the average of the last three quarters or so, or I mean how should we think about what is a normal level for that line item?", "James Abbott", "Yes Brian, this is James. I think that if you looked at the third quarter\u2019s other non-interest expense line item and use that as a guide, that\u2019s probably a reasonable expectation.", "Brian Klock", "Okay thank you for your help.", "Paul Burdiss", "Than our normal quarter than this quarter.", "James Abbott", "Right, Brian at this level I agree with that.", "James Abbott", "Okay, thank you very much everyone for joining the call today. Thank you, Sabrina for hosting and we appreciate all of your attendance. Please feel free to send additional questions to me and we'll try to get back to you as within a reasonable period of time tomorrow for sure.

Davidson & Co.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zions Bancorporation Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "Thank you, Candace, and good evening. We welcome you all to this conference call to discuss our 2016 third quarter earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.", "The earnings release, the related slide presentation, and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.", "We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer section. We ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask question.", "With that, I will turn the time over to our Chairman and CEO, Harris Simmons.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you today to our call to discuss the third quarter results. On slide three are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.57 from $0.41 per share in the year-ago quarter. By using the same adjustments we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily adjusts for securities portfolio gains in this case, earnings per share increased about 26% over the prior year third quarter. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.", "If you go to slide four, we're on track with all of the targets we outlined in our June 2015 efficiency announcement. We continue to look for opportunities to reduce expenses. For example, the number of total full-time equivalent employees was down 251 or about 2.5% at the end of September from where it was a year ago. And revenue growth also remains a primary focus to drive earnings growth.", "On slide five, we are pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of both solid net interest income growth, which increased 10.7% over the past year, and a 10.3% improvement in adjusted noninterest income with the primary adjustment again being the elimination of securities gains. And as noted, we're also focused on maintaining expenses at a level that we expect to be essentially flat to the back end of last year.", "Turning to slide six, we posted an efficiency ratio of 66% in the third quarter and are at 66.3% for the year-to-date number. Recall our goal for 2016 is to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66% while maintaining adjusted noninterest expense below $1.58 billion.", "Although not shown on this page, I'll point out that adjusted noninterest expense was above the target rate in the third quarter, which is largely attributable to several items that we expect to not recur in the fourth quarter. Paul Burdiss will review this a little later in his prepared remarks. I'd also note that we are achieving all of this while making very substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects.", "Moving to slide seven, we experienced soft loan growth in the third quarter which we largely expected when we discussed the prior quarter results back in July and then highlighted during the quarter at a conference appearance. We weren't alone as the industry generally experienced tepid growth. For Zions, the primary reasons for the linked quarter softness in loan growth were twofold. First, oil and gas loan balance has declined more than $250 million in the third quarter. And secondly, we are, as we've noted, being quite conservative on commercial real estate lending. In fact, we had more than $450 million less in new commercial real estate originations this past quarter as compared to the prior two quarter average.", "In the third quarter we experienced stronger growth in consumer loans, which were up 2.3% relative to the prior quarter end, and 10% over the prior year. Overall, over the past year we experienced what we feel to be an acceptable 6% growth in loans and 4% growth in deposits. Prudent loan growth is among our top priorities and some of the steps we're taking to help ensure that growth include finding ways to accelerate the time required to move loan applications through the approval and funding process and adding additional mortgage loan originators and devoting additional resources in a couple of our specialty lending areas.", "Moving to slide eight, as a general comment, we're determined to be a strong performer relative to the industry in the next credit cycle. And we don't currently see significant problems developing in any of our markets. Overall credit quality metrics were relatively consistent with those we reported in the prior quarter with a moderate increase in nonperforming assets, but a decline in both gross and net loan charge-offs.", "Slide eight looks at the credit quality indicators of the non-oil and gas portfolio. In the third quarter we experienced net loan recoveries of $11 million, bringing the year to date figure to a net recovery of $10 million on a portfolio of about $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans.", "On slide nine, you can see that with regard to the oil and gas lending portfolio, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for losses and problem credit levels over the next several quarters as we're seeing some favorable indicators both within our portfolio and in the industry generally although we do expect the oilfield services portfolio to weigh on credit quality for a while longer.", "With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin on slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $117 million or $0.57 per share.", "Harris has just discussed the increases in two key revenue line items and I'll talk a bit more about expenses shortly. But before we leave this page, I'd like to highlight two key areas. First, return on assets has increased to 84 basis points, up from 69 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Return on average tangible common equity increased 7.9% from 6.1% in the year-ago period. We are committed to increasing these measures of balance sheet return on profitability and we are certainly encouraged by the recent improvement.", "Let me make a few comments about our revenue. About three-quarters of our revenue comes from net interest income driven primarily by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer-related funding.", "Slide 11 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. As a reminder, the size of the circles represent the relative size of the loan portfolios. We remain encouraged with growth in the areas that are targeted for growth although we certainly would have liked to see more growth in the third quarter, especially in C&I.", "As we mentioned in the second quarter earnings call, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward. And, indeed, in the third quarter relative to the second quarter CRE loans increased at an annualized rate of just less than 5% which is slower than the 11% rate of increase relative to the year-ago period.", "Total originations in CRE declined more than 30% from the prior two quarter average for more than $450 fewer originated. We expect non-oil and gas, commercial and industrial and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the national real estate portfolio and the oil and gas portfolio.", "Slide 12 outlines the recent trends in net interest income which continued to demonstrate growth in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 10.3% when compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by $2.5 billion of growth in average loans and $4.6 billion of growth in the investment portfolio.", "While we remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates as shown in the box at the bottom right hand side of the slide, we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans. The interest rate risk characteristics of which, when combined with continued growth of customer deposits, have resulted in a somewhat less asset-sensitive position than has been the case in recent years.", "Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25 basis point short-term rate increase would produce between $25 million and $30 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the size and composition of the balance sheet. It will take a few quarters for the impact of any short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized as only about half of our loan portfolio is indexed to short-term LIBOR prime. As a reminder, our performance objectives, that were initially communicated in June 2015, assume one additional 25 basis point Fed fund target rate increase in December of 2016.", "Slide 13 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the third quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position and in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and to better balance the company's risk return profile. During the third quarter, the available for sale investment portfolio increased to net $872 million when compared to the prior quarter.", "We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk. The mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about four years with a duration extension risk being only about a half a year if rates were to rise 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio including our floating rate SBA securities is about 2.8 years today, and if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree.", "Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yield of the investment portfolio and loan production, can be seen on slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.11%. Some of that compression was attributable to a decline in income from loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009. The remainder was primarily due to reduced fee income that is amortized on commercial loans as the weighted average coupon of the portfolio declined only 1 basis point when compared to the prior quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped again this quarter similar to the move in the prior quarter, which was primarily due to increased premium amortization.", "Turning to slide 15 and noninterest income, total noninterest income increased $145 million from $126 million in the year-ago period. Customer-related fees, as stated in the slide and in the press release, increased to $125 million from $113 million a year ago. The notable areas experiencing significant growth include mortgage, treasury management, and wealth management. Within customer-related fees, there were about $3 million of income that came from a variety of items that are unlikely to reoccur in our opinion.", "Outside of customer-related fees, approximately $11 million of the income in noninterest income was attributable to the strong valuation performance of a publicly traded company held in our small business investment company portfolio. We would not expect that income to recur in future quarters.", "Noninterest expense on slide 16 increased 3.1% from the prior year and, if adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in our GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back, the increase was closer to 5.6% from the year-ago period. However, as noted on the slide, there were a few items that caused the result to be elevated which we do not necessarily expect to recur in future quarters. Some of these items include, for example, an adjustment to our healthcare and benefits costs which is about $5 million impacting the salaries and employees benefits line item. Some of this was related to an elevated level of lump sum pension distributions and, as you know, this is where employees choose to withdraw their pension benefits all at once. There was an adjustment to professional services costs of about $2 million related to further enhancements in our risk modeling. There was a linked quarter increase of about $8.5 million in the amount set aside for legal settlements and judgments. And some of the elevated expense was partially offset by a lower accrual for executive compensation which impacted the salary and benefit line.", "In summary, when you add the pluses and minuses, the total noninterest expense line item was a few million dollars higher than what we believe is a typical quarterly run rate. We remain confident in achieving our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion of adjusted noninterest expense for 2016. As we said in our February Investor Day, if we cannot achieve this goal through reducing inefficiencies within the company, we will reduce executive compensation.", "Finally on slide 17, we have increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share per quarter. Additionally, we began executing on our common equity buyback plan which calls for $180 million between July 2016 and June 2017. We expect to maintain a relatively strong capital ratio but we do believe the company is overcapitalized relative to its risk profile and the buyback plan should be helpful in keeping that overcapitalized position from strengthening further.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Thank you, Paul. Well, let me start with just a high level commentary on the oil and gas portfolio, and that is that we remain cautiously optimistic. We've seen strong equity injections into the companies during the third quarter and borrower and sponsor sentiment has certainly improved in many of the segments. However, at the same time we continue to experience difficult challenges in the oilfield services portfolio that we believe will continue well into next year.", "On balance, we think the impact to earnings from oil and gas problem credits over the next several quarters will be substantially less than what we've been experiencing over the last year or so. Simply because, over the last two years, we've been building the reserve against the oil and gas portfolio and charge-offs were ramping up. And over the next year or more, we expect the charge-offs will be tapering down and we are in the early innings of seeing reserve releases.", "Over the next four quarters we expect oil and gas net charge-offs to trend downwards somewhat from the last 12 months, reflecting our continued cautious optimism. And we expect that we'll experience the gradual release of the oil and gas allowance for credit losses over the coming quarters.", "On slide 18, we show on the left side of the slide the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other, which is essentially the mid and downstream portfolio primarily centered in midstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased $256 million from the prior quarter. This was probably the greatest decline in energy outstandings we've seen in any quarter to date. Additionally, we're seeing a fairly large number of favorable resolutions each quarter. Over the last six months, approximately $625 million of criticized balances were resolved through payoffs, paydowns or upgrades, which is nearly 80% of the beginning balance. The biggest decline came from the services portfolio which declined more than $130 million and about $100 million of which was favorable resolutions.", "Looking at the problem loan metrics of the oil and gas portfolio, classified oil and gas loan balances decreased $44 million in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, a much improved performance compared to the prior quarter's deterioration. Total nonaccrual balances increased, with all of the increase coming from the services portfolio. As I've noted in the past, the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on payments.", "Turning to slide 19, regarding our loss expectations, assuming oil were to hold in the mid-$40s or higher, and natural gas similarly positioned favorably as well, we expect energy losses for the next four quarters to be somewhat less than in the past year. And that most of those losses will come from the services portfolio. The third quarter losses reflect the results also of the Shared National Credit exam both in terms of our loan quality and charge-off metrics that we've reported. Although the losses remain elevated, we have a strong reserve set aside against our oil and gas loans. The reserve is more than $200 million which represents more than 8% of outstanding balances.", "On slide 20 is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. We are fully committed to achieving a positive operating leverage and I think at this point, with more than 20% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit, customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers, and improve our new product time to market, position us well to more aggressively adopt enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages.", "Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today. And we are tracking well with those goals as discussed earlier. Regarding return of capital, we are pleased to have made progress in returning more capital to shareholders.", "Finally we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgement that our commitment to doing business locally really is a strategic differentiator is the industry-leading results we received again this year in a nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research.", "With that, Paul, I'll turn the call back to you.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Thanks, Scott. I'll draw your attention to slide 22 (sic) [slide 21] which depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter.", "We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which could be interpreted as an annual growth rate in the sort of mid-single digits. We continue to expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high-single digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan and investment securities growth. Although our efficiency target, looking forward into 2017 includes the assumption of one additional quarter rate point hike in December, we believe we can achieve our targeted growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target Fed funds rate.", "Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a provision of just over $15 million this quarter which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments. This was assisted by various net recoveries outside of the oil and gas portfolio. We do not believe that it is a sustainable level and thus, we believe the provision for credit losses will likely be more consistent with the level that we experienced in the first half of 2016, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions.", "We expect that customer-related fees, which we define in our press release and which exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, will be stable from the level reported in the third quarter, which had been noted on the slide to include about $3 million of miscellaneous income that we don't consider likely to recur, at least on a sustainable basis.", "We remain committed to achieving our goal of adjusted noninterest expense of less than $1.58 billion for 2016 which implies about $395 million or less in the fourth quarter. In the first half of 2017 we expect to experience the typical seasonal variation as was seen in the first half of 2016 with most of that variation occurring in the first quarter. Although we are striving to keep expenses low and stable, the outlook for the next four quarters is consistent with the initial goal outlined in June 2015 which called for a slight increase in 2017 relative to 2016.", "We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% over the next four quarters and we expect preferred dividends to be between $40 million and $45 million over the next 12 months. And, as mentioned in my earlier remarks, we do anticipate redeeming up to $144 million of higher cost preferred equity, although we do not expect that to have a material benefit to the forward four quarter outlook.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Candace, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Absolutely. And our first question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR. Your line is now open.", "Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Hey, good afternoon. I just wanted to talk a little bit about commercial loan demand and, outside of energy, I know you guys said you were hoping it would be a little bit stronger although it was a big contributor in the quarter. Some of your peers have talked about softer demand in C&I lending. I'm just curious what you're seeing.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "I think that's consistent with what we saw during the third quarter. The third quarter has generally been a softer quarter. You get kind of the summer vacations and everything else baked into it, but this was softer than I think we would have expected. And so we'll see what happens through the remainder of the year. But it was a softer quarter in C&I than we would have hoped for.", "Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "You'll notice, also, it was similar last year. We had the same period of softness last year.", "Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. But it sounds like this is more than seasonal, is the sense you all have from customers.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, from the actual activity you've seen, I think that's probably the case. As we noted, you do have this other factor of oil and gas-related loans declining, which is pretty good headwind. I mean that was $250 million during the quarter, and so in a C&I portfolio that's pretty significant headwind.", "Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Fair enough. And then just on the commercial loan yield, some of your peers saw a little bit of lift this quarter from the move in LIBOR, and it looks like your commercial loan yield wasn't up. I'm just kind of curious, any thoughts there about maybe why you didn't see a little more strength on that.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. This is Paul. We did not see a \u2013 as you know, the one month LIBOR changed a little bit. Three months LIBOR changed a little bit more. The change in one month LIBOR really wasn't that material, and the majority of our loans that are LIBOR-based are really based on that shorter part of the curve. So, I noted several items that contributed to the 5 basis points of margin compression related to fees and FDIC-related income. The change in LIBOR was not enough to offset those headwinds.", "Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, and our next question comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Hey. Good afternoon.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Hey, Brad.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Hey, just wanted to follow up on the provision guidance. I appreciate the color there, but just curious kind of what's driving the increase maybe from this quarter. You guys still have one of the strongest reserves out there. A lot of the provisioning in the first half of the year was related to the oil and gas industry. It seems like, Scott, your comments around that are pretty positive in terms of kind of where the charge-offs are heading. Just kind of curious why that can't stay low, was that all a function of maybe the slightly higher loan growth that you guys are seeing coming down the pipe.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah a couple of comments, Brad. I think this quarter benefited by a pretty significant level of debt recoveries, generally in the C&I portfolio, and so that muted the provision to a certain degree. And I think also it's just very hard to project out four quarters, particularly as it relates to our energy services portfolio, number one.", "Number two, we'll finish this year \u2013 well, let me just say it this way. Through nine months we're net recovered on 94% of our loan portfolio. So while we generally trend around 10 basis points to 12 basis points in net charge-offs per year over the last three or four years, we're running right now to net recovered positions. So I think our assumption is while we think we'll see improvement, we're optimistic on the oil and gas charge-off front. We do believe we should naturally see some charge-offs on the non-oil and gas piece.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Sure. And just one follow-up on the oil and gas piece, what price per oil and gas were you using in your slide decks these days, in your price decks for new credits, or as you review the book going forward?", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. Generally, we're going to run somewhere around 90% of NYMEX on oil and on natural gas, and so our oil price tag starts in the low $40s and escalates about $5, $6 over a six-year period of time. Natural gas, there's been quite a run up in natural gas right now and we're probably a little less than 90% in terms of NYMEX on the natural gas price tag we're using.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, and our next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is now open.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Good afternoon.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Hey, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Back to the commercial loan growth, just wanted to get if you have any early indications at all around how growth is coming out so far in the fourth quarter or if you've seen a little bit of a turn in that sluggishness? And then also, what C&I growth rate is needed to meet your mid single digit growth guidance? What's baked in there in terms of C&I growth? Thanks.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Well I guess I'd say, in terms of loan growth, I mean we kind of got a report card every Monday morning and last week I was discouraged and this morning I was encouraged. And it'll probably seesaw back and forth. I think it's still a little early in the quarter to make much sense of it.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "And in terms of loan growth rates in general, it's sort of a 5% to 7% growth rate for C&I. The CRE portfolio we're projecting to kind of grow in the 4% to 5% growth rate range. Even though it's softened in the recent quarters, we are still anticipating growing that. And then we are seeing nice increases on the consumer side this year principally through our mortgage related products. The C&I growth rate is very consistent with the mid-single digit growth rate we need for the entire portfolio.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Got it. And Scott, on that CRE comment you made, does that include owner occupied or do you include that in the commercial when you say that?", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "No. Owner occupied is part of C&I.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay good. All right. And then secondly, just wanted to ask around the energy reserve, as you see these reserve releases materializing, if you don't see a material change in other areas of the loan portfolio, would you expect that there's going to be outright releases or do you think there's a likelihood of reallocation. And then, secondarily, where was your loan loss reserve for energy before we saw the slide in oil prices a little while back? Thanks.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "I don't recall exactly where. Our energy reserve was probably not too different than our total reserve, so it would have been around 1.6%, 1.5% going into the downturn. Now, it's at 8%. I tried to provide in my remarks a little bit of a multi-year reconciliation of that. And the guidance that Paul was providing around provision for the entire company really would lead you to believe that we would see moderate releases in that energy reserve.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah, this is Paul. I'd just add on as a reminder the energy reserve is over 8% and, in fact, this quarter, on a dollar basis, there was a little bit of release in energy. But because the decline in the portfolio outpaced that, the energy reserve on the portfolio remains at over 8%.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Got it. All right, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, and our next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, thanks. Just in terms of the margin, actually the cash that you guys have the redeployment from cash and money market into securities, can you just remind us how much more of cash or money market do you actually have that is easily switchable into securities from here?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, I'm going to change your question around a little bit if I could. You say easily switchable. We've got an enormous amount of on-balance sheet liquidity and off-balance sheet liquidity, right? So our cash position is a couple of billion dollars and so, certainly, we would be looking to redeploy that. But I would just remind everybody that we do have a lot of liquidity in addition to just on the cash balance sheet that could allow us to continue purchasing through this year and as we get into 2017.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah, and I guess I was just trying to separate out the cash that you want to keep in cash versus the cash you that you've clearly identified as going into securities over, say, the next couple quarters. And, if I heard you right, it was a couple billion? So $2 billion? Is that fair or?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "No, I wouldn't say that. Sorry if I wasn't clear. The amount of cash you need to hold on the balance sheet is not a big number although it's probably going to be in the hundreds of millions, and maybe a billion dollars. The fact of the matter is, is that the securities we're buying are so liquid that it really minimizes the need for on-balance sheet cash. If that gets to your question?", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Maybe a slightly different question, just you mentioned the premium amortization was a component of the NIM compression. Is that something that, now that we're at a lower level, NIM should remain at that lower level? Or is there any part of premium amortization next quarter cause some pop upwards in the margin?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah, the premium amortization is due to prepayments on the portfolio as you know, and there are kind of two big chunky parts of the portfolio. One related to our SBA bonds, and the other related to our mortgage-backed securities. Incidentally they're both impacted by kind of different macro factors. I will say that the primary factor this time was accelerated prepayments on mortgages. And so you can look at kind of the Refi Index as probably an indication of where that amortization is going. And so what we saw was increased amortization due to increased prepayments on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio.", "To the extent the yield curve steepens, my expectation would be that those prepayments would slow down and you would see a corresponding impact on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. I would also note that there are a lot of macro impacts related to the \"Brexit\" that appeared to have slowed prepayments down as we have moved into October.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jill Shea of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Jill Shea - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Good evening. Maybe could you just touch on the guidance around NII and the ability to attain the mid-to-high single-digit growth even without a December rate hike? Can you just speak to the confidence there? Is it NIM stability, is it loan growth or is it the cash deployment into the securities book? Maybe just dig into that guidance and how we should think about the outlook for the NIM going forward.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah, sure. This is Paul. It's kind of a combination of all those things. As a reminder, we would expect net interest income to be over 12 months positively impacted by about kind of $25 million to $30 million for every 25 basis point rate increase. But the big mover, as we've seen over the course of the last year, and you saw this in our PPNR, which Harris noted was up over 20% over the course of last year, a lot of that is related to improvements in net interest income.", "And a lot of that is related to kind of our ability to maintain coupon on the loan book, and while we're growing the loan portfolio, and then deploying cash and liquidity into the investment portfolio kind of moving out of assets earning 25 basis points to earning closer to kind of 1.25% to 1.50% (37:39) or more potentially. But also importantly to the extent we're deploying kind of off balance sheet liquidity it continues to lever our capital which we would expect to continue to grow net interest income. So we feel pretty good about our ability to grow loans, maintain margins and as you know redeploy cash in the investment portfolio.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "And Jill, this is James. I might just jump in and mention that on as we look at the book of business, particularly on the commercial loan side, as we look out over the next several quarters, the loans that are maturing have a coupon that is very similar to the loans that we're producing so we're not seeing a lot of compression. As a total book of business the coupon on our loan portfolio only declined 1 basis point and so you see in the GAAP yield table that the yield on the loan portfolio declined 5 basis points. Only one out of the 5 basis points was due to the coupon declining. The rest of it was due to the changes in the way that fees are amortized on that book of business in the FDIC and so forth. So we're really not seeing a lot of compression on the margin side. So Paul talked to the volume side and the margin is probably relatively stable.", "Jill Shea - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. That's really helpful. And then just in turn, I think you already touched on some of the securities portfolio adds but you noted in the slide that you're not necessarily limited by the cash currently on the balance sheet. Can you just walk us through how you think about the size of the securities book? Is it a percentage of earning assets? How should we think about the potential securities build over time?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. The securities portfolio exists first and foremost as a source of liquidity for the balance sheet. And historically we've held a lot of cash for that purpose and now as noted we're deploying that into investment securities, highly liquid HQLA if you will, highly liquid assets as defined by the LCR, in order to maintain what is a very strong position as it relates to the LCR.", "Looking ahead, we use the investment portfolio again primarily for liquidity but also to manage interest rate risk. And as we think about our interest rate risk positioning over time, I think you had seen us slowly decrease that. That is our asset sensitivity so that process may continue and so that's kind of a secondary use if you will. The investment portfolio is a mechanism to add duration to the balance sheet that helps to balance kind of the very short term, short duration assets we have with the relatively longer duration liabilities.", "So it's really those two components that drive the size and composition of the investment portfolio.", "Jill Shea - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our question comes from David Eads of UBS. Your line is now open.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon. Maybe just kind of touching on this balance sheet theme, you saw a really nice increase in noninterest bearing deposit and deposits in general seem like they're up pretty solidly. I guess, anything unusual going on there and in the event deposit growth exceeds loan growth that most of that will end up being deployed in securities?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "My expectation would not be that deposit growth exceeds loan growth, certainly over the medium term. In the near term, as noted, we're deploying our balance sheet liquidity into securities and so to the extent to your question if that were to happen, it would probably affect the types of products that we're buying on the asset side because of the kind of relative nature perhaps or length of time we might expect to hold those securities. But certainly, I would see us continuing to deploy that excess cash into securities.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "David, it's Scott. The growth in demand deposit is principally a function of just our business banking orientation and our industry leading treasury management products. And generally there will be some ebbs and flows in that, but you'll generally see growth in demand deposits in the second half of the year kind of from the late summer through the end of the year, would be a seasonal occurrence that we would expect.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks. And then, in the kind of geographic loan growth chart, I see that if you look at the C&I ex-energy, the biggest negative growth market was in energy. I'm just kind of curious whether you would characterize that as just kind of the same typical just slowing demand. Or was there anything different going on in Texas this quarter?", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "This is Scott. That's where you would see this principally the majority of this $250 million of energy paydowns.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "I was talking about the ex-energy, the $86 million of negative growth.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Oh, excuse me. Yes, I wouldn't really comment much on that other than the economy has obviously slowed in Texas, particularly in Houston. And I really should be careful to say it really has not slowed at all in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Their job growth is very strong where we have a bank. There's solid growth in San Antonio, the economy there where we have a bank. But Houston, particularly, you're seeing activity level decrease across the board, and so my guess is that the fundamental driver of those lower non-energy C&I outstandings.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "And David, this is James. I'll just comment, I'm familiar with some payoffs due to some merger activity, so we don't do a tremendous amount of leverage buy out financing, and so some of our middle market companies were purchased during the quarter. And that accelerated some of the payoff rates.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Everybody.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Hello.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So the company made nice progress over the past year in growing PPNR, that's pretty clear. With a guidance calling for a slight increase in expenses in 2017, what are your thoughts on a more aggressive cost containment program in 2017? Maybe something similar to what we saw out of Comerica?", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, I expect that you'll continue to see progress in terms of head count and I mean we're continuing to identify opportunities. We're doing a lot of work in terms of process in back office. I think for us and probably for the industry that the pace of branch closures probably slows, though it won't stop. For us, we've been at this now for several quarters. We're not likely to bring in a lot of consultants to try and figure out refresh what we're going to do next. I think we've got a pretty good game plan.", "I would note, I'd just remind everyone, that we're doing something that nobody else in the industry is doing, and that is we're in the process of replacing all of our core processing systems. We think that that's actually a really important kind of long-term investment to be making in a digital age that we're in. It cost us about $35 million this year and about the same next year.", "I think when we come out the other end of this, which is still it's kind of three years away, but I do expect that's going to create a much simpler back office in this place. And that's where the real opportunity is and so we're really focused on doing things that aren't just very short term but really reinvent how we do business, starting with systems. And so I don't envision changing course but I think we're going to continue to make pretty good progress. And, like I said, I think expenses are going to be pretty flat, but you have to run pretty hard to keep flat because you have, I mean cost of labor is starting to increase. We're seeing increases here and there and, like I said, a lot of systems work going on. So I think we can keep expenses flat, that'll actually be a pretty good achievement.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I appreciate that perspective. Maybe just a second one for Scott, if we look at the $256 million reduction in energy loans in the quarter, how did that split between performing loans and distressed credits. Thanks.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Steven, I don't have that number right in front of me.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "My recollection, if I could jump in, Scott, was that the composition was pretty similar to the remaining portfolio, but we could verify that.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. There wasn't anything particularly unusual, although there was a significant positive impact we had in problem credits. So one way to think about that is recall that our oilfield service portfolio, which has outstandings of about $500 million \u2013 that, that portfolio is going to amortize about $100 million a year even in a difficult environment, and we're seeing that because most of \u2013 as I noted, 90% of our energy credits are performing as agreed regardless of how we have them classified.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Then maybe I could ask this way. Are you seeing some of your more distressed credits get access to the capital markets and use those proceeds to pay you guys down?", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Yes. The answer to that question is most certainly. I sort of vaguely referenced it earlier, but we had about $200 million of new either private equity injections or capital markets injections into our oil and gas portfolio companies. That was the largest quarterly increase that we had seen. That number is about $450 million now since January 1 of 2015.", "So $200 million in a quarter is very significant, and I'd say about 40% of that number came from capital markets activities. 50% to 60% came from private equity injections. And we've seen that private equity phenomenon all throughout the downturn, but the public markets have opened to back up to a certain degree.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for all the color.", "Operator", "Thank you, and our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Hi, Ken.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Just one more question on the securities portfolio. Paul, you mentioned a year ago that you'd find about $6 billion or so. It looks like you've already kind of gotten to that point, and you're still growing at about $1 billion a quarter. So is that the kind of pace that we should be expecting to see the book grow? And is there any stopping point where you get to that right level of the book with a combination of securities and you add this on the swap side?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "The answer to that is yes, there is a stopping point and we're not there yet. So to your point we outlined, initially, we outlined a plan to move cash into the investment portfolio. As we've done that I think we recognized the benefits of that and so we're continuing to work on that position, if you will. Ultimately, kind of the \"stopping point\" would most likely be defined by kind of our target asset sensitivity and with a minimum required on balance sheet liquidity in the form of high quality liquid assets. And so perhaps as we move through time we'll be able to give kind of a more search and outlook around that but I think for the time being your point is a good one, which is we've kind of achieved what we said we were going to achieve and we're continuing on the path.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And we saw that with your FHLBs up as well so I guess is that how should we assume it would be largely funded if loans are growing the same pace as deposits.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, I think what you saw, you're talking about the quarter-end number, had some modest increase in FHLB borrowings. Is that what you're referring to?", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. Those were actually relatively short-term and they were there to take advantage of a kind of very short-term, I'll say, anomaly in the capital markets that were related to money market reform that allowed us to kind of pocket a little extra money there at quarter end. So those are not long-term borrowings but I will say that over time as we move through cash over time I would expect us to access the Federal Home Loan Bank system in sort of the normal course of business.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And just one quick one on ROE, it got close to 8% this quarter on ROTCE. You've talked about a desire to get to double digits. You mentioned previously that you think you could get there with rates in 2017. Can you get there without rates in 2017? And if not, is it possible in 2018?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, look, is it possible? Certainly. But I would say that we'll be in a position I think to provide kind of a better kind of outlook and guidance as we get to the December earnings call in January. So there are a lot of things that go into that measure. As you know, we're really focused right now on improvement to the efficiency ratio and we're going to continue to be focused on that. Ultimately, an improved efficiency ratio should drive better balance sheet returns, should lead to better ROE. We're also very focused on through the CCAR process, managing our capital more effectively. And because there are two components to that, we kind of control the numerator. The denominator is subject to the kind of regulatory CCAR process. It's hard for us to provide a lot of clarity and guidance on precisely when we're going to get there.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "And Ken, this is James. I just wanted to jump in on the outlook for double-digit returns on tangible common equity, I think what we've said was it was more of a 2018 aspirational goal as opposed to 2017. I would just modify the year there and tell you more to come on that.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the clarification James.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is now open.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Thanks. I wanted to build on Steven's question earlier about the \u2013 as you're seeing the run-off in energy loans. The graphs that I was looking at is page 9, if you look at the criticized loans in oil and gas to your overall loans and classified to loans and nonperforming to loans, those are all trending much higher as percentages. But when you look at the actual numbers when you got back to page 18, I was surprised to see that the actual levels, or dollar amounts, went down. So it does seem like there may be more of an exodus of the performing loans versus what we're seeing in criticized or classified. So I just wanted to make sure we kind of focus back on that question again just to kind of reconcile those two pages.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Sure, Marty. Let me, I was actually going to bring us back to that. It's a fairly technical question, I have the information, but it wasn't totally committed to memory. We started the quarter at about $800 million in classified loans and ended the quarter a bit down from there, about $770 million in classified loans. We had about $220 million in what I would call very positive favorable reductions of classified loans either through payoffs, or paydowns. I'm not talking about charge-offs, okay, $220 million. That was one of our strongest quarters of positive resolutions.", "But far more important than that is that the inflow of new classifieds or increase in existing classified oil and gas loans was the lowest inflow, the smallest inflow that we've had since the middle of 2015. So if you want to think about it, we started out with about $800 million in classifieds with about 25% of those had positive resolutions and we were not replacing them as fast as they were running off, so.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "And the net, if you look from $800 million to $770 million, you positively dealt with $220 million. That means that you had inflows of about $190 million, I guess. Is that about right?", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "That's exactly right.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Okay. All right. So still about equal in a sense of what's leaving and what's coming back as you kind of go through that process. But yet still, like you said, improving from what you've seen before.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Paul, I want to ask you on the mortgage-backed securities, trying to reconcile again two things that seem a little bit contradictory. One is you have no extension whatsoever in duration when rates go up, but when rates come down you have cash flows and prepayments. I know you can buy some CMOs that are more one-sided in the sense they don't extend, but they do because they're in the early tranches, get paydowns. Is that what's driving that, is that there's that hard stop on the extension but yet you have the risk of the prepayments when rates go lower? Is that why that discrepancy is kind of coming out?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Marty, I guess the trick in our investment portfolio, the part of it that does look a little bit different is that we do have these SBA pools and the prepayments on those are not correlated to rate necessarily. So what we see is they are positively convexed instead of negative convexed. And so in our models as we run the rate shocks, what we're seeing is that, if you will, the positive convexity of the SBA pools and the negative convexity of the MBS roughly offset each other, which is why you don't see the extension risk in the plus 200 basis points rate environment as disclosed. Does that help?", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "So the netting of that is why you don't get the extension, but on the short end, the mortgage-backed prepayment is what caused you the impact this quarter.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, again, the mortgage prepayments are related to changes in rate and the flattening curve.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Right.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah, accelerated prepayments there. There was not a corresponding impact in the SBA pools.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Got you. All right, thanks.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you, and our next question comes from Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.", "Gary Peter Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to hit on the fee side for a second, I recall, I think it was this past year's Investor Day or possibly the one before, you talked a lot about bringing that fee income contribution up to, I think, 25% as sort of an intermediate term goal. Over the last year you've made some progress on bringing up obviously the customer fees, but the percentage hasn't changed much. I wonder if you could update kind of what you're thinking there given the relative moves of net interest income versus fees.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Sure, thank you, Gary. This is Scott. First of all, the fee income ratio with the pace of which net interest income is growing because of loan growth and the repositioning of cash, I don't think you're going to see us make a lot of progress in terms of that ratio, just the pure math of it, because we're trying to grow our customer fees in the kind of mid-single digit rate 5% to 7% range. And net interest income is growing at a faster rate and may continue to, based on the guidance we've provided. So I think the more important number we're focused on is just the absolute dollar amount of customer related fees and total fee income and how that's accretive to earnings.", "So and that number is again very nicely a little bit stronger than we would've expected so \u2013 and it's across the board which is really important. It's in our work horse fee income item is treasury management. It's about 30% of our $500 million in fee income. It's growing very nicely on a linked quarter year-over-year basis as well as year-to-date. Our credit card income is growing nicely. Wealth management, we basically had two wealth management platforms. We had two of virtually everything. We have now gone through the organizational process of creating one business and it's terrific to see that business growing. The insurance component of that business has been a leader for us as well as just our core investment management business.", "So good solid progress in wealth management after making a lot of tough decisions there. Mortgage as we've noted is up. Foreign exchange, a nice business for us, is up. Really we're seeing good solid progress across the entire fee income spectrum.", "Gary Peter Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "All right, Scott. Thanks for the color.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "And, Candace, this is James. We'll take one more question here. I believe we have \u2013 it's John Moran from Macquarie. We'll go ahead and take John's question and then we're out of time. So, John, go ahead with your question.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey. How's it going? Can you hear me?", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. We can. Thanks, John.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. Great. Yeah. Okay. So, hey, I appreciate the detail you guys I think called out some healthcare and professional fees in legal on OpEx. The other line ran heavy this quarter. I just wondered if you could explain what was going in there and kind of what the outlook would be there for that line.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "John, this is Paul. A big chunk of that was really that legal accrual that I discussed. I think the key, as you think about expenses, I think the key is what we published on slide 21 of the investor deck which just says that we would expect noninterest expense for the next four quarters to be roughly stable with what we experienced in the third quarter 2016.", "John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Got you. Thanks.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Good.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "I think I'll just turn the time back over to Harris for some closing comments and we appreciate you joining the call today.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah, thank you very much. We will look forward to talking to all of you next quarter and the couple of conferences in between. Overall I think we feel quite good about the quarter and the direction things are headed. If we see a little better loan growth that'll obviously help us and others around the industry, if we see a little better loan demand. But all in all, we're really pleased with the year that's starting to come to a close, and we appreciate all of your support. Thank you.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Welcome to Zions Bancorporation's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. We will have a question-and-answer session later and the instructions will be given at that time.", "Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. James Abbott.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Carmen. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2017 first quarter earnings. To begin, we will hear prepared remarks from Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer, as well as other Zions executives who are available to address your questions during the question-and-answer session.", "I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.", "The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this doc reconciliation.", "We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour. During the question-and-answer section of the call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable all the participants to ask questions.", "With that, I will now turn the time over to our Chairman and CEO, Harris Simmons.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Thank you very much James and welcome to all of you today to our call to discuss our first quarter results. I'm going to go to the slides that accompany the earnings release on slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. I would characterize the quarter as a healthy performance in terms of deposit growth and containment of the cost of deposits and credit performance with the exception of one large loan that I'll discuss more in a few minutes. At the same time, we're not entirely satisfied with total loan growth although we did outperform the industry relative to the December level. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.", "On slide 4, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue reflects steady improvement, up 17% year-over-year, the result of both solid net interest income growth which increased 8% over the first quarter a year ago, and expense controls that limited adjusted noninterest expense growth to 3.8%. Much of the improvement in the net interest income came from the growth of income from the securities portfolio, as we worked to trim our asset sensitivity in exchange for more income today, while simultaneously reducing risk. Looking forward, we expect that interest income on loans will shoulder more of the burden of growth for 2017 and beyond. Year-over-year, GAAP noninterest expense increased 4.5%, while adjusted noninterest expense increased a lesser 3.8%. I'm encouraged that salary and benefits excluding severance only increased about 1% over the year ago period. Outside of our direct control, we experienced a more than 70% increase in deposit insurance costs as the FDIC instituted a surcharge to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund.", "Turning to slide 5, we posted an efficiency ratio of 65.9% in the first quarter, declining 2.6 percentage points from 68.5% in the year ago period. Of note, because of seasonal factors in both revenue and expense, we believe it's more appropriate to compare the efficiency ratio to the year ago quarter. Our goal for 2017 is to achieve an efficiency ratio in the low-60s, while holding adjusted noninterest expense growth to between 2% and 3% from the 2016 actual result of $1.580 billion. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while making some relatively substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects. We'll continue to work hard beyond 2017 to identify additional opportunities to become more efficient.", "Moving to slide 6, similar to the industry, we experienced soft loan growth in the first quarter. Although on a more encouraging note, we've already surpassed total first quarter loan growth in the first three weeks of the second quarter. One of the strengths this past quarter has been in the 1-4 family loan area, which experienced a 23% increase in originations over the prior year and is fairly heavily skewed to purchase activity rather than refinancing volume.", "During the first quarter of this year, we purchased $166 million of residential loans, which we may occasionally do if the opportunity presents itself and if it fits within our basic balance sheet management strategies.", "Regarding borrower optimism, I would say that we are generally hearing more optimism across our entire customer base. Although much of this is anecdotal, one data point that bears noting would be our Nevada affiliate's recently completed annual survey of small business customers. In the past three years, only about 40% of Nevada business owners felt that the national economy was headed in the right direction. In our 2017 survey, that number jumped to nearly 70%.", "Nevada businesses who plan to increase their employee base rose to 36% from 27% in last year's survey and more businesses expect to apply for a loan over the next 12 months than in the past. Although that is just one of our markets, it has been one of the more challenged markets for the past decade and we are optimistic about the future there and across our footprint.", "Turning to deposit activity, although we generally experience volatility of deposit balances near quarter-end, the average deposit balance was stable when compared to the December quarter, and increased more than 5% from the year ago period.", "Slide 7 depicts the credit quality metrics of our loan portfolio. We're encouraged with the decline in classified loans and general stability in nonperforming assets. Net charge-offs increased slightly as a result of a single loan that was charged off. During the quarter as described in the earnings release, one of our commercial loan customers experienced rapid deterioration in its financial condition when it became subject to a governmental investigation. That investigation resulted in the seizure of some of its assets. Because of the uncertainty of the situation, we charged off the entire balance of approximately $30 million. That amount equaled nearly 2/3 of our net charge-offs recognized in first quarter.", "We expect to pursue legal action to work towards a recovery, although no such recovery can be assured. At December 31, 2016, because of the financial condition of the company at that time, we had a very minimal allowance for credit loss on this particular relationship. And as a result of the events I just described, most of the provision for loan losses in the first quarter can be ascribed to this situation. Because of the nature of the situation, we cannot comment further on it.", "Over the past couple of years, we've broken out credit quality metrics for oil and gas loans from non-oil and gas and we still do that in the appendix for those of you who are still interested. However, we are getting fewer and fewer questions about the oil and gas portfolio. We're increasingly confident about the credit performance of the oil and gas portfolio.", "Let me cite a few statistics. Number one, our oil and gas companies were able to raise a combined $1.1 billion of equity during the first quarter, roughly double that of the prior quarter. Number two would be that although still below the historical peak, the oil and gas rig count in the U.S. has increased more than 90% from the year ago level, which is a substantial benefit to our companies and particularly our service companies. Number three, several of our exploration and production companies are expecting the services companies to increase prices in 2017 and they're already seeing an increase in prices in certain subsectors of the services industry.", "And finally, our expectations for credit loss on oil and gas has improved materially in the past three months. Excluding the charge-offs from oil and gas of $14 million and the one credit that became subject to the government investigation that I mentioned, our net charge-offs remained very, very low. Currently, we don't see any systemic or emerging theme that may cause problem loans or loan losses to increase. Finally, we remain disciplined on our concentration limits.", "Turning to slide 8, I'll highlight the improvement of two key profitability metrics, return on assets and return on average tangible common equity over the past few quarters. Return on assets increased to 88 basis points in the first quarter, up from 62 basis points a year ago. Average return on average tangible common equity increased to 8.8% from 5.6% a year ago. We're encouraged by the continued improvement and remain focused on achieving highly competitive returns on our balance sheet relative to peers.", "With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to further review the financial results. Paul?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide 9. For the first quarter of 2017, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $129 million, or $0.61 per share, up from $0.38 per share in the year ago period. There are some items within this quarter that are lumpy including securities gains and dividends primarily from Small Business Investment Company investments adding to about $7 million in the quarter, severance expense of about $5 million, and income tax benefits that include a one-time adjustments to state taxes of about $14 million in addition to a $4 million benefit from the tax \u2013 in the tax line related to the new stock-based compensation accounting guidance.", "We've adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We've highlighted adjusted pre-provision net revenue which increased 17% from the year ago period, as Harris discussed earlier, although it dipped slightly from the prior quarter primarily due to seasonal factors. The last item highlighted on this page is the efficiency ratio, which as Harris has already discussed in detail.", "Let me make a few comments about revenue first, about three quarters of our revenue comes from net interest income primarily driven by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer related deposit funding.", "Slide 10 depicts the recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate growth in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 8%. I'll highlight the key volume drivers of this revenue item first and then discuss the rate component. The most significant factor in the year-over-year increase in net interest income is the $7 billion period end balance and $6.2 billion average balance, increase in investment securities.", "If you'll turn to slide 12 (sic) [slide 11], as we suggested at our January report, we continued to purchase high-quality liquid securities during the first quarter, increasing period end securities portfolio by $2.1 billion and average securities by $2.5 billion, versus the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk. As discussed in previous reports, the mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about four years with a duration extension risk about half-a-year, if rates were to rise 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including floating rate SBA securities is about 3.2 years today.", "If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree, which is attributable to our discipline in purchasing mortgage-backed securities with limited duration extension risk, and because the floating rate Small Business Administration securities held in our portfolio are expected to prepay at a faster rate as the economy strengthens and rate rise, thus, serving as a counterbalance to the mortgage-backed security prepayment risk.", "We expect the growth rate of interest income from securities to decelerate as we move through 2017, although we expect the second quarter's growth to remain somewhat strong. As observed in the tables in the earnings release, the period end securities balance is about $1.5 billion more than the first quarter average balance. So, we should expect an increase in net interest income related to the investment portfolio in the second quarter. We expect relatively stable period end securities balances over the near-term.", "The other major component of earning asset volume is of course the loan portfolio. And slide 12 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year ago period. The size of the circles represent the relative size of loan portfolios. We experienced 3% growth in non-oil and gas commercial and industrial loans. Owner occupied loans increased nearly 3% and have experienced an improving trend after being relatively stable during the past two years.", "As we have discussed in previous calls and at investor presentations, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward and in fact CRE declined in both the first quarter of 2017 and in the prior quarters. The primary driver of the decline is our commitment \u2013 the primary driver of the decline is our commitment to manage our portfolio concentration limits as Harris mentioned earlier.", "We continue to experience a reduction in oil and gas loans of nearly $100 million in part due to merger activity, recapitalization and re-margining activity, and to a modest extent, loan losses. We achieved a 14% year-over-year growth in 1-4 family mortgage including some loan purchases as previously described and a 9% growth in home equity loans, which is consistent with our desire for stronger growth in these portfolios.", "Looking ahead, we expect non-oil and gas, commercial and industrial, and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the National Real Estate portfolio and in the oil and gas portfolio although we expect a decline in 2017 for both portfolios to be less than that we experienced in 2016.", "Turning to the rate component of net interest income, which is on slide 13. We break down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which increased 3 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.14%. There were a handful of items that limited the natural expansion of loan yields during the quarter including reduced income from loans purchased from the FDIC and lower prepayment penalty income relative to the prior quarter.", "On the bottom right portion of the page is a table of interest rate characteristics of the portfolio. You'll notice that about 40% of portfolio, net of forwards and swaps, floats with prime and one month LIBOR. As a reminder, the key drivers of our asset sensitivity are the immediate benefit from floating rate loans, some additional benefit from loans that reset later in the year and limited duration extension risk in the securities portfolio, largely funded by low cost transaction-oriented client deposits.", "The securities portfolio yield increased significantly this quarter. Most of the change is attributable to reduced premium amortization as compared to the prior quarter, due largely to higher interest rates.", "Our cost of deposits did not change relative to the prior quarter. While we are monitoring the competitive landscape and will act accordingly, we currently expect deposit costs to remain fairly stable over the near-term. Additionally, the change in the composition of average earning assets dampened the net interest margin expansion by a few basis points when compared to the prior quarter.", "On slide 14, there is an update to our interest rate sensitivity, which is not substantially different than the prior quarter, but has been reduced a fair amount from the year ago period. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25 basis point increase across the yield curve, after year of seasoning, would produce approximately $15 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the size and composition of the balance sheet. It will take a few quarters for the impact of a short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized, based upon the information provided on the prior slide.", "Turning to slide 15 and on noninterest income, total noninterest income equaled $132 million, up from $117 million a year ago and up from $128 million in the prior quarter. The increase in the quarter was driven by an $8 million increase in net securities gains and an $8 million increase in dividends and other investment income primarily due to increased market values of the company's Small Business Investment Company investments. These gains were partially offset by a decrease in fair value in nonhedge derivative income of $7 million resulting from fair value adjustment.", "Customer related fee income declined slightly from the prior quarter due in part to a decline in lending activity, partially offset by an increase in credit card and interchange fees. As we continue to focus on fee income, we are still targeting mid-single-digit annual growth for the full year 2017.", "Noninterest expense, on slide 16, increased 4.5% from the prior quarter and if adjusted for items such as severance and other similar items, noninterest expense increased 3.8% from the year ago period.", "During the quarter, we experienced annual seasonal compensation related expenses as detailed on the slide which explains most of the linked quarter variance. Also, as noted in the press release, we experienced a $3 million reduction in salary expense primarily related to loan origination. This was the result of an update in the estimation process associated with the consolidation of loan operations. This capitalized expense is expected to amortize over time through the net interest income. We are reaffirming our expectation that total adjusted noninterest expense will increase between 2% and 3% in 2017, when compared to the 2016 actual results.", "On slide 17 is a list of our key objectives for the remainder of 2017 and 2018, and our commitment to shareholders. We are fully committed to continuing to achieve positive operating leverage. With more than 17% year-over-year actual growth in pre-provision net revenue, our efforts continue to make a noticeable difference.", "We remain committed to the substantial simplification of our operational processes. We also continue to work hard to upgrade our technology, which we expect will result in improved customer information infrastructure. When complete, this investment should simplify our back office, provide additional data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers, and better enable us to adopt enhanced digital capability.", "Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today. And we are tracking toward those goals as discussed earlier.", "Regarding returns of capital, we are pleased to have made progress in returning more capital to shareholders in the past year. Of note, we have repurchased nearly 4 million shares or nearly 2% of shares outstanding, since June 30, 2016. Although it is premature to give specific guidance on our expectations for the horizontal capital review process for 2017, the results of our internal stress testing indicate that we continue to have an opportunity to optimize our capital position in order to be more reflective of the company's manageable risks. Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach.", "Finally, slide 18 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which is to be interpreted as an annual growth rate in the mid-single digits. We expect net interest income to increase moderately over the next 12 months. This represents a deceleration from our prior outlook simply because we have largely completed the purchases of investment securities, as I mentioned earlier. No additional rate hikes are assumed in this outlook, although we do expect some further benefit from the March increase in the federal funds target rate. Additional increases in short-term rates are expected to improve net interest income.", "Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a net provision for both funded loans and unfunded commitments of $18 million in the first quarter, largely due to the isolated charge-off discussed earlier, and partially offset by a decrease in the provision related to oil and gas portfolio. We are increasingly optimistic that the credit deterioration we experienced from the oil and gas portfolio has turned the corner. We expect that customer related fees, which are defined in our press release and exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, should increase moderately from the level reported in the first quarter.", "We currently expect adjusted noninterest expenses to increase in 2017 between 2% and 3% relative to the 2016 reported results. Excluding adjustments for state taxes and the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation discussed earlier, we expect our effective tax rate to remain in the 34% to 35% range for 2017, barring any meaningful changes in the tax code.", "We expect preferred dividends to be approximately $37 million in 2017. And as mentioned in my remarks earlier, we do anticipate redeeming $144 million of high cost preferred equity in the first half of 2017. Diluted shares, assuming the share price remains near current levels for the quarter, may decline 1% to 2% in the second quarter from the first quarter, due to both the share repurchases and a reduced impact from the outstanding warrants that we described in detail in the January report. Please see the appendix of the slides for further sensitivity on the warrant effect.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Carmen, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. And our first question is from the line of Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Hey, good afternoon.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Hi, Brad.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Paul, just wanted to ask a question about the balance sheet, maybe specifically the bond portfolio and the overall size of it. What's kind of your biggest driver there? Is it the rate environment or do you look at it as a percentage of earning assets? It looked like this quarter you maybe added some leverage through some borrowings maybe to support the bond portfolio. Just curious, would you continue to do that if rates move further in your favor, or kind of what your thinking would be around kind of a larger bond book?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "The size of the portfolio, as we've discussed previously, the size of the portfolio has really been \u2013 and the increasing size of the portfolio has been based upon our need due to the change in liquidity rules and other things to maintain a permanent store of liquidity on the balance sheet. That's kind of primary.", "Secondary is, the management of interest rate risk as you alluded to, and sort of converting possible income into certain income in the current period. So, all of those items have conspired to increase the size of the portfolio. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we do not expect, Brad, for the securities portfolio to increase really from the March 31 levels.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up, maybe for Scott, I know all the energy metrics, they're moving the right way. But I did notice the ratio of non-current NPLs in the energy books slipped from maybe 86% to down to 73%. Do you read anything into that, anything to be concerned about there? Is that just kind of getting down to the \u2013 maybe the worst NPL that you got in that book, or any other trends you're seeing there that we should be concerned about? Thank you.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Thank you, Brad. Specifically no, I'm not worried about the decline in that ratio. It's actually still higher than that ratio for our entire portfolio. So, it was unusually high to start with, unusually favorable to start with, and the decline is not something we're concerned about. As Harris noted, and Paul as well, the fundamental conditions in the industry are improving. You can see that externally in the first quarter earnings releases of Schlumberger and Halliburton. Access to capital is really good both through public markets, sales, private equity firm interaction. And so we're going to continue to watch the portfolio very closely. But all the trends are really positive with the exception of the one statistical trend you noted and the fact that NPAs were up slightly, but we're seeing good solid improvement.", "Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Hello. Thank you for taking the question. On the reduction in asset sensitivity, can you give us a sense of how much further you'd like to continue bringing that down?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Hey, Geoff. This is Paul. I'll take that. We have managed that down over time, and I think again over time, we will continue to see that decline. Although, I'll say that the pace is a little undefined and we'll be opportunistic based on what we see as kind of the shape of the curve and sort of the relative value. As mentioned, the securities portfolio isn't really going to grow from here, and so any incremental management of our balance sheet positioning, our interest rate risk positioning, will really be managed through the swaps portfolio. And as you know the curve is relatively flat today, but not to say that we won't continue to manage that down. But ultimately that's going to be an Alco discussion item and we haven't really provided a whole lot of guidance on the pace of continued reductions in asset sensitivity.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Thanks. And then just to follow-up on that, last quarter you talked about moving away from the fast and slow disclosures to something more consistent with what most peers are giving just kind of a single number, and then sensitivities around that. Where have you got to with that process?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah, Jeff. Thank you for remembering that and for that question. We are \u2013 as you would imagine, any change like that requires a lot of model redevelopment and that requires a lot of data analytics and a lot of validation and other items. And so we have worked through that process almost entirely at this point. And so, I would expect to see that no later than the next quarterly disclosure.", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP", "Great. Thank you.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is now open. Mr. Mosby, your line is open.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Good afternoon, can you hear me now?", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Yes.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yes, sir, Marty.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "Perfect. I just want to do a little bit of ticking and time (30:32), because you do have a lot of pieces that you kind of threw in there. It seems like to me when you start off with the $0.61 and you take the security gains and the severance, they kind of offset each other. And then you start looking at the tax adjustments versus the bigger charge-off and you get a little bit of a net pull down of a couple of pennies, and then you start to add back the seasonal expenses as that starts to roll forward. So, what I'm looking at it and you're looking at the efficiency ratio improving from first quarter to second quarter, while you could look at the security gains and the tax adjustment isolated from the other pieces and think, well, maybe you need to round down in earnings, really when you kind of look to these moving pieces, you can see a step-up even from the reported number as you move into the second quarter, and just wanted to kind of get a feel for how you see those moving pieces all come together like that.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Hey, I'll start and look at my compatriots to kind of add some color. Marty, this is Paul. The \u2013 first of all as you know, there's a lot of focus on GAAP reporting and so, we just want to ensure that our investors understand the GAAP financials which is what we reported. As you said, there are a lot of moving parts, and for me personally, it would be I think hard for me to provide sort of an \u2013 a near-term quarterly outlook. As you know, our outlook is really more of a \u2013 kind of a 12-month nature. We try to provide all the pieces that will allow our investors to kind of look through and sort of decide what's important and what's not important on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And so I don't know that we can give a whole lot more guidance in addition to that.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "It just feels like that as you look at the reported number, if you do kind of take into account all those pieces that we talked about that there is the opportunity the step-up from here as further efficiencies and seasonality comes out in the next couple of quarters, because that efficiency ratio was 65% and you're low \u2013 going to the low-60s. That's a pretty big step-up in profitability just there.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. And so, we Marty this is Scott, we would anticipate though as has been indicated that we're going to \u2013 we're staying on track with our efficiency ratio objective in the low-60s and expense growth in the 2% to 3% range. So, there's a lot of \u2013 there are so many moving parts and I think we highlighted very specifically the expense difference between the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year, a lot of that is very one-time oriented. The other \u2013 there are other changes too in areas like fee income where we had some, what I would describe as sort of one-time events in the first quarter of last year and then there's seasonality that you pickup in the first quarter too. And so there are a lot of moving parts and I think our messaging would be that we feel \u2013 continue to feel confident about the projections that we've given, the guidance that we've given about efficiency ratio and expenses.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "And then Paul you mentioned that the securities portfolio would start to kind of stabilize. When we talked before you've talked about kind of now transitioning to a little bit more use of interest rate swaps as a balancing factor in the sense of asset sensitivity. So, do you feel like you're going to start transitioning there and start adding a little bit more in the swap book as you move forward?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, yeah Marty, clearly as I said, the securities portfolio we just don't expect to grow from here. So, to the extent the Asset Liability Management Committee here continues to manage our interest sensitivity down and my expectation is that will happen. But I'm kind of one of many votes, but my expectation is that over time we will continue to manage our asset sensitivity down and swaps are the next tool in the tool box after we've exhausted the use of the securities portfolio. So, kind of a squishy answer to your question Marty because we haven't provided a lot of guidance on that topic specifically. But I think generally the direction that you laid out is correct and the direction that we've discussed previously is correct. And that is, once the securities portfolio has been sort of fully bought out, we will look to the next tool in the tool box which is interest rate swaps as we think about continuing to manage down our interest sensitivity.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP", "And just the impact of restructuring doesn't end with the portfolio. You have another tool that you'll be able to start using so, thanks for your answers, appreciate it.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. Thanks, Marty.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon, guys.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Hey, Dave.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Good afternoon.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Could you guys give some of the numbers behind the factors that put downward pressure on the loan yield this quarter? You mentioned the lower accretion, the lower prepays et cetera, any numbers you can give there?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, what I can say is, there's a lot of little things that kind of add up to something significant. There's the kind of the headwind of reduced kind of FDIC related contribution. That was probably a couple of basis points. We had kind of non-accrual related items, interest reversals that were also a couple of basis points, maybe 1 basis point on that, 1 to 2 basis points prepayments or maybe 1 basis point. So it's a bunch of little things, Dave, that kind of add up into that headwind that I tried to describe, which is why I didn't break it out more eloquently in my prepared remarks, because there's a bunch of dogs and cats in there.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right. No, I appreciate the color. I'm just trying to get at basically where the loan yield can go from here with the March rate hike. It sounds like that can move decently higher versus the change that you saw in the first quarter, so just any thoughts there?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah, Dave, that's why we've tried to provide \u2013 we've got some new color as you know, as I'm sure you've noted from slide 13 of the earning slides.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Where we're being a lot more specific around sort of the index and the timing of reprice.", "So you can kind of take a look at that. The other thing I'll notice is or I'll note that we've got swaps and floors in there. The swaps portfolio relatively modest at I think it's $1.4 billion. We've also got some caps in there. A lot of those caps are actually at 100 basis points on LIBOR. So the next rate move, we expect most of those caps to no longer be in the money. So there's several factors that to your point, we expect with the next rate move to continue to be additive to net interest income and certainly as it relates to the March move, we have yet to see that fully priced through here in the first quarter.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And Paul, where are your new loan yields post the March hike in your securities reinvestment rates, can you just talk about those? Thanks.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "The securities reinvestment is probably 2.25ish, which hasn't changed a lot because the yield curve, as you know, has stayed fairly flat even if the short rates have come up. New loan yields are on the floating rate stuff will be a little bit higher. The fixed rate stuff just aren't going to change a lot because, as you know, the fixed rate \u2013 fixed rate part of the curve just hasn't changed much.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah, Dave this is...", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Would you say new loan yields are \u2013 go ahead. Sorry.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "This is James. I'll just add a little bit. The coupon of the portfolio of the loan production during the quarter was just on a touch under 4% for the quarter, and that's up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. That's obviously not the production we had in the very last week of December \u2013 I'm sorry, the very last week of March. But it is \u2013 does give you some sense as to where we were for the quarter on average.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Would you say that just given the production today, that's above where the book's yield is on well the loan side, James?", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. It's \u2013 it is \u2013 well, the whole book yield is moving up because of the variable rate nature of the book.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "So, yeah, it's...", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "But the loan \u2013 average loan yield is 4.14% in the quarter, right.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "And so, the other thing to consider, Dave, is the kind of the composition of the portfolio, what's growing and what's not. So, residential mortgages for example have a lower overall rate than the total portfolio yield, so \u2013 and we are growing that. So I think you \u2013 there are several factors to consider, just thinking about trying to look forward at the loan yields.", "Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Great. Thanks guys.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "Good afternoon.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "Back to the margin on the loan yield again, the \u2013 I know you mentioned, Paul, the 40% of your loans float with prime or LIBOR inclusive of your floors and everything. If you did ex the floors and swaps, what is that variable rate percentage? And then separately just wanted to see if you can kind of give us more of an overall thought process around where your margin, what type of trajectory you could expect this \u2013 through the end of the year?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Sure. I'll start with the first question. Again referring to slide 13, you can see, John, we've tried to break out so for example all prime and one month LIBOR floating rate loans are about 47% \u2013 or 47% of the portfolio. We showed the effect of hedges and floors there. That's what gets you down to the 41% or about 40% as I said in my remarks. So, that 47% I think is the number that you're looking for, which is sort of a 30-day reprice. When you add up all the pieces though and kind of go down the list, you've got two to three months LIBOR, 6 to 12 months LIBOR kind of all those pieces together and you can see there's kind of a 66% that's tied to those shorter-term indices.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. And how did that gross number change quarter-to-quarter, that 46% number?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "It hasn't really changed a lot. I think what we've disclosed in the past, John, which is why we tried to provide some incremental disclosure this quarter, is more of the sort of what floats under a year and that gets us to that kind of 60% to 66% sort of number. That's the number that we've talked about, because for a long time rates just weren't changing, so it was kind of an academic exercise. Now that the target rate is changing with a little more frequency, we thought it important for investors to understand kind of where the key points were in the portfolio, as it relates to interest sensitivity, which is why we've provided this incremental breakout. So the short answer is, it hasn't really changed, but we're just trying to provide a little more detail to be a little more transparent as it relates to the floating rate nature of the portfolio.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Paul. And just as a follow-up on credit, the charge-off, I know you couldn't talk too much more about it. But could you just give us what sector, what industry it is? And then separately the inflows into non-accruals looked relatively elevated given that NPAs are up despite the big charge-offs, and what drove that?", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "It's a healthcare related credit. I don't know if Michael if you want to say anything more about it?", "Michael P. Morris - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, no. All I'd say is that, it's an isolated event. It's non-systemic we believe. And we don't believe that it represents or is reflective of any other adverse trend in healthcare, if that's helpful. And then on the NPAs, slight uptick in NPAs for the quarter, some positive things already in the works this quarter. So, no real concern around that uptick and no real specific industry to point to.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "I mean it was though a little bit more of an uptick when you consider the big charge-off though, right?", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. Although \u2013 it wasn't nonperforming at the end of December.", "Unknown Speaker", "Right.", "Michael P. Morris - Zions Bancorp.", "It was a performing loan at December, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. All right. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good afternoon, everybody.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I wanted to ask on expenses. If we look at the $411 million of adjusted expenses in the quarter and we think about the run rate for the second quarter, Paul, if I look at the three items you're calling out on slide 16, so the $7 million of stock-based comp, $6 million of payroll taxes, and then $4 million contribution to the 401(k)...", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "...can you walk through how much of each of those should come out of the run rate in 2Q?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, the way I think about it is this, and this is kind of one way to think about it. But these are sort of annual expenses and so you've got sort of a full-year's effect have all shown up in the first quarter effectively. So these items, the reason we call them out specifically is that these are not items that we would expect to show up again in the second quarter.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "I think the math of it is basically if you take three quarters of that number and subtract it from $411 million, it gets you to where the run rate probably should be.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Right.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then just one follow-up, many banks here are calling out a need to ramp their tech spend, and you guys have obviously invested very heavily in technology over the past few years. Are you, in your mind, ahead of the curve or do you also need to ramp your spending in tech here to think about digital...", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "I hope so.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "...and some of these other things?", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "I think we believe we're ahead of the curve. Because we're trying to address our core loan and deposit systems, which for literally almost every other bank in the United States are 25 to 30-year old systems. And it is a many year project to address both of those. And the primary pressure driving that is obviously the pace of technology change, but the onset of the digital \u2013 just the digital requirements of customers and everybody that we interact with. And so you fundamentally cannot take 20 to 30-year old core loan and deposit systems and adapt them to a digital world. You just \u2013 the money you would spend on middleware would be astounding. So we're trying to address the core problem. Cyber security is also another key driver of this, and I think the industry as a whole is driving hard in terms of technology spend around cyber. But almost all banks have put off this investment in core and we are well into that process right now.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's good color. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Guys, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about deposit pricing. It was obviously very stable and you didn't really have any change this quarter. But any competitive dynamics or just a notable sense of change in your client base?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Hey, Ken. It's Paul. I'll start and ask anyone else to sort of join in. I was at a conference \u2013 I spoke at a conference here in the last quarter, and we talked a lot about deposit pricing, and kind of how \u2013 my opinion is that the liquidity coverage rules are kind of defining (46:36) deposit value right now. And I think there we are starting to see that impact deposit pricing. So I'll just remind everyone on the call that our portfolio, deposit portfolio looks a lot different. It's very granular, it is commercially oriented. It is very sort of client-based and deep relationship-based deposits. And so, we are not seeing, and I'm not hearing of pressure on those deposits yet. So, we're keeping an eye on it, and we've got our ear to the rail as we think about that. But in fact, so far we're just not feeling a lot of pressure on deposit price.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then secondly, just wondering in terms of funding the securities purchases, you had a big increase in the short-term borrowings which you said you might use, but the cost of those borrowings actually went up a good amount off of a low base. Now that you're approaching more of a level set for the investment portfolio, do those borrowings level out? Because you're kind of paying a little bit more incrementally for the borrowings than you are getting, at least in this quarter incrementally on the securities.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "I don't think we're paying more on the borrowings than we're earning on the securities. The securities are yielding over 2% and the borrowings are I think around 80 if I remember correctly. I can pull it out if you want.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "I'm talking about sequentially. I'm talking about the delta, sorry, the delta between the two, not \u2013 you're right, of course there's a margin on them, but I meant the delta between your securities was up 20 basis points, but the borrowings was up 35 basis points.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "No problem.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah. So, in order to really affect interest sensitivity, we basically need to invest long and borrow short, and that's kind of what you're seeing there. I mean, that's ultimately sort of the driver of the interest sensitivity change. And ultimately the net value or the net volume we have associated with that incremental funding, is just going to be heavily dependent on kind of loan and deposit growth. And that, as you know, is sort of the balancing mechanism, as is the investment portfolio. So as we move through time, as everyone has heard me say previously, deposits really drive the value of a banking franchise and so deposit \u2013 incrementally, deposit growth is going to largely drive the incremental need for funding clearly, as we think about loan growth increasing throughout the rest of the year.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Okay.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "And so (49:11) deposit growth, that short-term funds will be affected. But I'll also remind you that we can also manage the investment portfolio as sort of a balancing factor also.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC", "Got it. Thanks, Paul.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Thank you, Ken.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks. Actually, I had sort of a similar question, just on the $2.9 billion of short-term borrowings. So Paul, are you saying that this \u2013 that ultimately this gets replaced with core deposits as it grows or is this like just an intentional strategy to add \u2013 whatever it was $2 billion plus worth of short-term borrowings and maintain it on your balance sheet to make sure that your asset sensitivity stays low?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "I will characterize this as an intentional strategy. As a bank, and as you know, it is completely normal to be in sort of a net borrowed position. And so, we kind of \u2013 over time, we've had so many deposits that we haven't had that line item on our balance sheet in quite some time. I'm frankly very comfortable with the level of kind of that incremental wholesale borrowing of $3 billion on our balance sheet. I think it is totally normal and I'm completely comfortable with it. So I would characterize it as clearly intentional.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Okay. And then just a follow-up, on the non-customer related fees, so the $17 million that you got this quarter. That, I guess, combined numbers has just been all over the place. Is there any right number that we should think about going forward, is any part of that sustainable or recurring or is that all just insanely volatile? Thanks.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "There is a lot of \u2013 there is volatility in that. As I laid out, what I tried to do in my prepared remarks were to talk about kind of some of the key items that were impacting that. And at the very beginning of my prepared remarks, you may recall I said securities gains and dividends, this is largely driven by the Small Business Investment Company investment, we're about to add at about $7 million this quarter.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "And I would just add, Ken, this is James, that it's \u2013 one of the major sources of volatility over the last several quarters, I think three quarters now, has been a singular investment, which is actually a publicly traded company at this point. And so, it's not Level 3 accounting. It is observed prices in the market, and it is an investment that we've been involved in for years. And so, that's unfortunately the stock market is volatile from time-to-time and it's just \u2013 we've just \u2013 you've just seen the result of that.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "And I'll just say, since James brought it up, it is a publicly traded investment. And it's not our practice to kind of hold on to those for extended period of time. So, we are \u2013 this is again out of our SBIC portfolio. It blossomed into a publicly traded company, which is a great outcome. And now, we are kind of disposing of that investment as quickly as we can.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS. Your line is now open.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon. There's been a ton of questions about kind of the nitty-gritty on NIM and NII and maybe just kind of circling back, I guess the overall arching theme that you guys are talking about is sort of mid-single-digit-ish NII growth for the four quarters ending 1Q 2018 versus 4Q quarter \u2013 four quarters ending 1Q 2017, correct? And when I, I guess, when I look at the details that 1Q 2017 was up about 8.5% year-over-year, it looks like there's a couple of tailwinds sequentially for NII in 2Q from the balance sheet growth led (53:10) securities at the average securities coming on and then some benefit from loan yield. So I guess the bottom line, is there opportunities for that mid single-digit guide to be conservative or are there headwinds that we should be aware of or is there anything we're missing there?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "I think the key tailwind or key opportunity there is increased or increased short-term interest rates. So to the extent that that as I said in that outlook really don't have any assumed additional tightenings, fed tightenings in there. So that's clearly an opportunity. The other kind of opportunity and headwind, I think, is \u2013 or potential headwind is loan growth. And ultimately we've got a loan growth outlook here that accompanies that net interest income outlook, and we fully intend to achieve the loan growth. And if it's better than we are expecting, then that could be helpful and vice versa. Scott, I don't know if you want to add to that.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "No, I agree with both of those points, and loan growth is really a key for us. We've said, we're going to keep the investment portfolio pretty stable at this point, and we started out a little soft on the loan growth side. But as you look at slide 12, as Paul noted when he talked about it, the fundamental areas of loan generation for us are growing and have the potential to grow at a faster rate. And we will hit the bottom of the oil and gas declines and National Real Estate declines. So that will taper at some point.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks. And maybe on that loan growth point, it looks like the \u2013 in the energy book, the unfinished equipment (54:55) went up, I think you mentioned it was related to the midstream part of the portfolio. And I just wanted to kind of get your updated thoughts on potentially taking on more energy loans, whether it would be kind of focused in the E&P and midstream space or a little bit more broad?", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Good question. We will definitely see the portfolio grow again. We've been a long-standing leader in energy lending in the country and we'll continue to be that. The growth will primarily come on the reserve-based side and on midstream. And on the reserve-based side as well as in the services sector, you're going to see revolvers being utilized again. And so we think that'll have a positive impact as well there is new underwriting going on both in the midstream and in the reserve-based side.", "David Eads - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Your line is now open.", "Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Hey, hello there. Just given the positive commentary around energy trends, is it your expectation that as you go through the redetermination process that loan upgrades are likely which could result in additional reserve releases?", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "Well, we're just starting in \u2013 this is Scott, we're just starting into the spring redeterminations and I think it's going to be kind of a flattish experience to the fall redetermination. And I think more important than the redeterminations, I think the financial results of our reserve-based borrowers is improving at a steady pace, and you're seeing drilling pick up as a result of the \u2013 you see the rig count increasing. And so I think the fundamentals in reserve-based lending are going to improve and you'll see that benefit in the reserve-based side, and you will absolutely see it in the services sector.", "Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Great.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "And also \u2013 and so as it relates to the reserve, we'll just have to watch charge-offs and the general credit parameters, but as we've said previously that reserve will continue to come down. Assuming characteristics \u2013 the industry characteristics stay as they are today or improve.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "I mean, I just \u2013 Bob, I'll just jump on here, this is James. One of the interesting factoids that I've found as I looked through some of the statistics this quarter on the services portfolio is that the rapid pace at which the services companies are returning to positive EBITDA and positive free cash flow. It's not to overstate it a little bit but 10 to 15 percentage points of the portfolio per quarter, not annualized, is how fast they're coming back into profitability.", "So it is a nice trend and certainly that's one of the trends that's causing the capital markets to be very interested in supplying capital to these companies.", "Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.", "I think the other thing that's important to note that, generally the outstandings on the services side are term loans and those term loans generally we're amortizing on a three to five year basis. Today, we have about $630 million in energy services outstandings. 15 months ago, that number was a bit over $1 billion. So the exposure is coming down rapidly and it will continue to decline just through natural amortization of the credits that we had.", "Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question...", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "Carmen.", "Operator", "...go ahead.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "Carmen, this is James. We're going to probably shift over to the lightning round here, so just one question now and we'll try to avoid the follow-up. And we'll try to keep our answers quote or quick rather and we'll move quickly through the last two or three minutes.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. And our next question is from the line of Scott Valentin with Compass Point. Your line is open.", "Scott Valentin - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC", "Thanks for taking my question. Just Harris, you mentioned growth accelerated. I think you said that quarter-to-date you've already outgrown percentage-wise all the first quarter, just wondering where you're seeing that growth come in, if it's C&I or other parts of the portfolio.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Quarter-to-date, it's been C&I, and it's been consumer primarily, a little bit of commercial real estate, but not very much. It's been primarily commercial and then some consumer.", "Scott Valentin - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Gary Tenner with D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.", "Gary Peter Tenner - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks, guys. Scott actually just had the question I was going to ask, but while I'm on the line here, just one more question on the healthcare loan. Can you confirm whether or not it was a Shared National Credit?", "Michael P. Morris - Zions Bancorp.", "It was not a Shared National Credit.", "Gary Peter Tenner - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our final question is from the line of Brian Klock with KBW. Your line is open.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Hey, Brian.", "Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.", "Hey, Brian.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "So, I just \u2013 I guess the last thing with guidance and NII, Paul, I guess can you just remind us then with the new balance sheet where we are if we get a fed hike that maybe comes in June. I guess, what's the next 25 basis point hike impact on your net interest income?", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Brian, we estimated in accordance with the slide there, we estimate that it's worth, if you take the midpoint between the fast and the slow, we estimate that to be worth about $15 million.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you for your time.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "And Brian, I'd just add, that that is a one year, so that shocks rates up.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Right.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "But then it \u2013 and then we \u2013 and then it takes a year for us to season before that effect happens. So, it'd be less than that if you just looked at the quarterly effect from the one month LIBOR...", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "But the full-year effect is about $50 million.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "But the full year effect is for the $50 million.", "Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.", "Yeah.", "Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back to management for final remarks.", "James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.", "Okay. Thank you very much for joining the call today.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "James Abbott", "Thank you very much, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2017 third quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial objectives; after which, Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer, will provide an update on the effects of Hurricane Harvey; and finally, Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail regarding Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook for the next 4 quarters. Additional executives with us in the room today include Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer; and other Zions executives who will be available to address your questions during the question-and-answer section.", "I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. And we encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release as well as a supplemental slide deck are available on our website at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to these slides during this call.", "The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including preprovision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services' analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.", "We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. [Operator Instructions].", "I will now turn the time over to Harris.", "Harris Simmons", "Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you on the call today to discuss our third quarter results. On Slide 3 of the presentation, we have provided some highlights for the quarter. We're really quite pleased with the performance as we continue to improve profitability while absorbing the cost of Hurricane Harvey during the quarter. We are pleased with the loan growth, particularly in the context of the relatively soft industry-wide performance in loan growth that we've seen so far. And because the growth didn't rely upon commercial real estate but instead was a result of growth in C&I and consumer loans, primarily on the consumer front, 1 to 4 family conservatively underwritten jumbo mortgages. We remained disciplined with the pricing of deposits. And the combination of those 2 factors led to a healthy increase in sustainable net interest income.", "In regard to credit quality, we remain pleased with the continued strong improvement within the oil and gas space, including a 12% linked-quarter decline in classified oil and gas loans and only $6 million of net charge-offs in the quarter.", "Loans outside of the oil and gas loan portfolio experienced generally pristine conditions with only 2 basis points annualized of loan losses, which is consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years.", "With regard to Hurricane Harvey, I note the recovery effort has been incredibly impressive. I'm really proud of all our employees and the hard work that they've been doing for the bank, particularly there in the Texas market, even as many of them have been working to recover on the personal front from damage that they sustained at homes and cars, et cetera. While the hurricane was certainly disruptive, we've reached out to many of our customers, and relatively few of them were materially impacted, a lot of minor damage but nothing that causes us really major concern.", "After reviewing a lot of information from both bottom-up and top-down perspective, we set aside $34 million in hurricane-related reserves on the $8 billion loan portfolio that has direct exposure there in Houston. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.", "On Slide 4, our adjusted preprovision net revenue reflects steady improvement, up 20% year-over-year. Some of the growth is due to the benefits of rising interest rates and securities purchases, which we do not expect to be a significant contributor to growth over the foreseeable future. But we do expect continued moderate loan growth and customer-related fee income growth, combined with continued expense discipline, which should contribute to further positive operating leverage, although at a moderating pace relative to the very strong pace that we've experienced since 2014.", "Turning to Slide 5. We posted an efficiency ratio of 62.3% in the third quarter, which was adversely affected by Hurricane Harvey-related expense. Nevertheless, the year-to-date efficiency ratio was 62.6%, which is consistent with our 2017 goal to achieve an efficiency ratio in the low 60s kind of percentage range.", "Slide 6 depicts 2 profitability metrics, return on assets and return on tangible common equity. Return on assets increased to 97 basis points in the third quarter of 2017 from 84 basis points a year ago. Return on tangible common equity increased to 9.8% from 7.9% a year ago. In both metrics, the linked-quarter comparison is best understood when considering the interest income recoveries experienced in the second quarter, which did not repeat as expected in the third quarter. We're encouraged by the continued improvement and remain focused on achieving competitive returns on our assets relative to peers.", "Moving to Slide 7. We experienced 3.8% year-over-year growth in loans held for investment despite continued attrition in our national real estate, term commercial real estate and oil and gas portfolios. In the third quarter this year, we experienced continued strength in 1 to 4 family commercial and industrial and municipal lending. We were not dependent upon commercial real estate growth in the quarter. And in fact, that portfolio declined slightly from the prior quarter.", "We're comfortable with our loan concentrations. The economy is generally strong. We've made some improvements to the origination process, all of which should contribute to continued moderate loan growth over the next few quarters.", "Loan growth outpaced deposit growth over the past year by a modest amount, just shy of $400 million, which we funded with incremental wholesale borrowings. Our discipline around deposit pricing has led to a very favorable deposit beta, or the increase in the cost of deposits relative to increase in the federal funds rate, but we'll continue to evaluate based upon market conditions and funding needs how we deal with further rate rises and the need to balance our desire to continue building a strong deposit base with deposit pricing pressures in the market.", "I'm going to turn the call over to Scott McLean to discuss the effects of Hurricane Harvey with you. But before I do, I want to take a moment and express my appreciation to our employees and customers and particularly those who've been dealing with difficulties and challenges down in the Houston market. Between Hurricane Irma, which followed Harvey and the fires in California, et cetera, it's easy to forget the enormity of this storm that hit Houston with 50 inches or more, in some places, of rainfall within a very short period, unprecedented in the reported history of the United States. We had our people there who responded magnificently, helping customers, helping each other and really helping the community.", "Before I turn the time over to Scott, I want to congratulate him before all of you. While all of this was going on, he was helping coordinate our own response with customers and employees. He was also busy raising $35 million for the United Way down in Houston. We had another of our people, Barb Vilutis, who's the chair of the Red Cross for the Houston area. We had some people providing real leadership at a time of great stress down in Houston, and I'm really proud of them.", "And so with that, Scott, thanks for all you do, and I'll turn the call over to you.", "Scott McLean", "Thank you, Harris. I'm happy to report, too, that we've actually got that United Way relief fund up to $45 million. We were highly motivated to exceed J.J. Watts' $38 million, so we had to go into extra innings over time to exceed his total, but we did, so...", "Harris Simmons", "That's great.", "Scott McLean", "If you turn to Slide 8. Within the Harvey-impacted area, we have, as noted there, approximately $8 billion of loan balances outstanding and just slightly more than $100 million of municipal securities balances outstanding. To quickly address the municipal securities, we're not expecting any material credit losses largely due to the fact that 90% of these municipal securities are general obligation issues. As it relates to the loan balances, they're broken out by type on the chart. You can see that the dotted vertical line depicts the 3 major loan groups within our portfolio, with the key takeaway being that it's a diversified portfolio, the vast majority of which is held within the Amegy affiliate. In combination with significant client outreach and interaction, we applied several allowance for credit loss techniques and models to inform our decision to book a qualitative allowance of $34 million. ", "Additionally, we recognized about $6 million of Harvey-related noninterest expenses, about 2/3 of which were occupancy costs basically, damage to buildings that were less than our deductibles; and about 1/3 was one-time expenses associated with recovery from the storm. And of that amount, about $1 million was given to employees in the form of grants, generally up to $2,000, and temporary housing allowances. It's also important to note that we made over 300 loans to employees, totaling about $5 million. This assistance was in the form of 5-year non-interest-bearing loans and really solid credit quality, as you can imagine.", "If you turn to Slide 9. We worked very hard to contact our commercial customers, as Harris noted and as I noted, and ultimately downgraded less than $70 million of loans due to the effects of the hurricane. Although it's important to note that most of those that were downgraded remained within the past range of our grading scale. So far, there have been minimal covenant waiver modifications made to commercial loans as well.", "Pivoting to Amegy's consumer loans. We are highlighting there the average loan-to-value ratios and consumer credit FICO scores of the 1 to 4 family known loans within the impacted area. This is reflected of the credit profile in June rather than after the storm. And so it may change in some situations as a result of the storm. But it goes to support the notion that we have a strong portfolio.", "I recognize, too, that the averages are only somewhat helpful. But we've reviewed the so-called tail risk of that $2.2 billion of loans, and it's really a low-risk profile. Only 3% of the affected area consumer loans took our offer for 90-day no-penalty payment deferrals. And although we have authorized a long-term loan modification option, we have seen very little activity on this program.", "All of this, combined with our statistics that are available at Houston.org, results in a general sense of comfort with our $34 million qualitative allowance.", "Just a bit of brief color on the storm so that you have a sense of really what goes on. The storm started on -- the rain started on Friday night, August 25, ended on Wednesday, August 30. And before the rain even began, we had successfully relocated the important operations activities that we conduct for Texas, as well as for the rest of the company. On Monday, the 28th, our customers were able to conduct every aspect of business other than that which is required to be transacted in a branch. And really, as you know, with the digital world, that's fundamentally the vast majority of transactions clients need. And on Wednesday, the 30th, despite the fact that it was still raining and the flood waters were rising, we were able to begin opening our branches on that day.", "Clearly, we concentrated our efforts to ensure our employees and families were safe. We then turned that attention to the well-being of our customers and the community at large. And as Harris noted, there were many great stories of volunteerism and leadership as he commented. Houston, as everyone knows, is a very diverse and resilient economy. There's no question the economy is back on its feet and running, in some ways, stronger than it did before.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Paul.", "Paul Burdiss", "Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the third quarter of 2017, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $152 million or $0.72 per diluted share, which is up from $0.57 per share in the year-ago period. There are some items within the third quarter of 2017 that are operating but generally infrequent, and those include, extreme weather-related expense of $6 million, which Scott just discussed; impairments to other real estate assets of about $2 million, recognized in the other noninterest expense line item; securities gains of $5 million; and gains of about $1 million on branch sales, and those show up in other noninterest income. However, all of these items, when you net them out, amount to less than $0.01 a share.", "Let me make a few comments about revenue. Nearly 80% of our revenue comes from net interest income. Slide 11 depicts the recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate substantial growth in the third quarter relative to the prior year period. Net interest income increased $53 million or 11%. The linked-quarter decline of $6 million is explained by the $16 million of interest income recoveries from 4 loans in the prior quarter, which we highlighted last quarter, and have noted in the footnote on this page. The most significant factor in the year-over-year increase in net interest income is the $5.5 billion average balance increase of the investment securities portfolio.", "Slide 12 shows the growth in the period-end balance of securities. With a relatively flat yield curve, we utilized a small portion of the cash flow from the securities in the third quarter, securities cash flow from -- securities portfolio in the third quarter, to fund a portion of the loan growth. As I've indicated in the past, we continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk. As the securities portfolio is expected to be relatively stable for the near term, the growth in net interest income will become more dependent upon loan growth than it has in the recent past.", "Slide 13 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. The size of the circles represent the relative size of the portfolios, and they are in no particular order on the page.", "Total loan growth, including the effects of a declining oil and gas portfolio and the national real estate portfolio, was 3.8%. If the oil and gas portfolio had been stable during the past year, which we expect will be the case going forward, the growth rate would have been closer to 4.4%. Originations and incremental draws on existing lines of credit during the quarter was stronger than the year-ago period by more than $300 million. The key takeaway from this chart is the relatively balanced growth for most of the loan portfolios, as represented by the circles. C&I, owner occupied and home equity loans all increased in the mid-single-digit range, while we experienced solid growth in 1 to 4 family and municipal loans. These are included in the other category. We experienced general stability in construction and land development and declines in term commercial real estate, oil and gas and national real estate.", "Shown at the bottom right is our expectation for loan growth by product type. We are comfortable with our commercial real estate concentrations and plan to grow commercial real estate at rates generally consistent with our overall mid-single-digit loan growth rate.", "Slide 14 breaks down key rate and cost components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which decreased 11 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.27%, but about 15 basis points of loan yield in the second quarter was attributable to recoveries of interest income from 4 loans. And net of that effect, our loan yield increased 4 basis points.", "Turning to the cost of total deposits. The average cost of total deposits increased to 12 basis points from 10 basis points a year ago, during which time the federal funds rate has increased 75 basis points, resulting in a so-called deposit beta of about 3%. Over the past few months, we have been selectively increasing deposit pricing in certain markets and with certain clients. But in general, we are not experiencing significant pressure to deposit pricing.", "On Slide 15. As most of you know, we reduced the interest sensitivity of the company and expected that, by doing so, the company would experience a substantial improvement to our stress testing results and experience a boost to current profitability. Because we transitioned to limited duration securities from cash, the difference in the spread between cash and securities in the third quarter of 2017 implies more than $90 million of incremental annual revenue when compared to the size of the securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "On the bottom left, we show the model effect on net interest income in a rate environment that is 200 basis points immediately higher across the curve relative to the current level. We would expect this to generate a 6% increase in net interest income annually.", "Turning to Slide 16 and noninterest income. Total noninterest income was $139 million, down from $145 million a year ago. We had a moderate decline in gains from securities as well as a slight decline in customer-related fee income.", "Beginning with customer-related fees shown on this slide, we experienced a decline of 100 -- I'm sorry, a decline to $122 million from $126 million a year ago. Within the loan sales and servicing line item, we had an impairment this quarter related to a loan that was held for sale that was nearly $2 million.", "Treasury management fees, which are included in deposit service charges, were stable from the year-ago period. However, retail deposit service charges declined slightly, almost entirely due to nonsufficient funds and overdraft fees. While that's not a bad outcome overall, it does adversely impact overall fee income. As noted in the press release, noncustomer-related activity, such as securities gains and dividends from small business and investment company investments, contributed to the bottom line, although not as much as in the year-ago period. We've experienced strong performance in wealth management and other certain capital markets products, and we acknowledge that we are not tracking as well as we had planned on some of the fee income items. However, we are still targeting mid-single-digit annual growth for customer-related fee income over the next year.", "Noninterest expense, on Slide 17, increased to $413 million from $403 million in the year-ago period. If adjusted for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments and other similar items, noninterest expense increased to $414 million from $404 million in the year-ago period. More than half of that increase was related to Hurricane Harvey which, as Scott said, rounded to about $6 million. Debt expense is split between about 2/3 in occupancy and 1/3 in other noninterest expense.", "Salaries and employee benefits increased $11 million from the year-ago period, which is mostly explained by unusually low incentive compensation accruals in the year-ago period. However, some of the increase in that line is also due to the substantial improvement in profitability this year versus last year, improved overall loan growth. Recall that last year, we only experienced about $50 million of loan growth in the third quarter and at better sales, all of which results in a higher profit sharing and incentive compensation paid to employees.", "A year ago, we indicated that we expected to experience an increase in total adjusted noninterest expense of between 2% and 3% for 2017 when compared to 2016 actual results. Despite expense associated with a major hurricane and higher-than-expected FDIC revenue-sharing expense and legal accruals associated with the recent settlement with the Department of Justice, we should end the year 2017 in about that range.", "Slide 18 depicts the overall credit quality metrics of our loan portfolio. We are encouraged with the meaningful improvement in classified loans, nonperforming assets and net charge-offs. Much of the improvement came from the oil and gas portfolio, and we remain optimistic that we will continue to see further favorable changes to oil and gas-related credits and measures. Although not shown on this slide, we have materially and substantially improved the average weighted risk grade on both the commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios during the last 5 years, and we remain disciplined in our consumer loan underwriting criteria. As such, we expect manageable credit cost, while much of the provision for credit losses will cover incremental loan growth.", "Slide 19 is a list of our key objectives for 2018 and 2019 and our commitment to shareholders. We are fully committed to continuing to achieving positive operating leverage. We have a couple of years behind us at this point in our effort to materially improve profitability and grow earnings. We remain committed to further improvement and simplification of our operational processes. We expect to operate with an efficiency ratio that is consistently below 60% for the full year of 2019. We expect to continue to invest significantly in technology improvements, which include the substantial overhaul to our core systems. Back in 2015, we indicated that we were going to be targeting a much more substantial return on capital than what we could see then, and we are tracking well toward those goals, although there is still room for improvement. Regarding returns of capital, we have increased that amount to a level above the peer median, and we view a moderate increase of balance sheet leverage as appropriate, particularly given the reduction of the risk profile of the company. We are asked frequently by investors as to what the appropriate level of capital would be, and we have responded that the stress testing results are the primary driver. You can see our company run midyear stress test results on our website, which were just published this afternoon. But to highlight to a single number, our post-stress common equity Tier 1 ratio is 9.9%, which is more than a full percentage point better than the result 3 years ago in our first iteration of the midyear exam and well above the 4.5% minimum regulatory threshold.", "A second consideration is where we rank within our peer group. For various reasons, we believe it is important to remain somewhat stronger than the peer median. We recognize that the peer median is likely to decline over time. And so while the peer-median analysis is a relative threshold for us, the stress test is an absolute threshold that we need to maintain.", "Finally, Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which is to be interpreted as an annual rate of growth in the mid-single digits. We expect net interest income to increase moderately over the next 12 months. We assume no additional rate hikes in this outlook. Additional increases in short-term rates are expected to improve net interest income.", "We posted a net provision for both funded loans and unfunded commitments of $1 million in the third quarter. Credit has continued to outperform our expectations. And thus, the cost has been less than expected, a trend which may continue. However, our base case scenario calls for a modest provision for credit losses over the next several quarters that is somewhat larger than the most recent quarter. We expect the customer-related fees, which are defined in our press release and exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, should increase moderately from the level reported in the second quarter.", "Harris Simmons", "In the first.", "Paul Burdiss", "In the first quarter, adjusted noninterest expenses. We expect to experience general stability in adjusted noninterest expense over the next 4 quarters. Bear in mind that the third quarter contains $6 million of hurricane-related costs, and we are not stripping that out when providing our outlook. Excluding adjustments for the 2017 accounting guidance for stock-based compensation, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 34% to 35% range for the next 4 quarters, barring any meaningful changes in the tax code. We expect cumulative preferred dividends to be approximately $34 million over the next 4 quarters, and diluted shares may fluctuate due to both share repurchases and the dilutive effect from the outstanding warrants. The dilutive effect of the warrants is predominantly dependent upon the future price of the stock, which we describe in detail in the January earnings report. Please see the appendix for further sensitivities on the warrant effect.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Brian, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of David Long with Raymond James.", "David Long", "Looking at the -- you guys held your deposit beta pretty low, and I give you guys kudos for that. Within there, you mentioned some selective increasing in deposit rates. I wonder if you could give a little bit more color there and maybe talk about deposit betas on retail deposits versus business deposits.", "Paul Burdiss", "I'll start, this is Paul. The betas are somewhat geographically-dependent. As you know, the majority of our deposits are commercial, not retail. And so where we're seeing pressure is on the, I would say, the larger end of those commercial deposits. As you know, our deposit portfolio, particularly our commercial portfolio, is extremely granular and is comprised primarily of operational deposits. And those deposits, which represent the bulk in the value of our deposit base, have proven to be resilient and stable.", "David Long", "Got it, okay. And second question, in regards to managing the balance sheet, and you talked about the CCAR process with your regulators. As we're looking out to the CCAR process in 2018, is there any changes in how you're going to manage that balance sheet over the next couple of quarters?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, it sounded like there were 2 questions there. As it relates to the next several quarters, that capital management which I think is what you're asking about, is defined by the capital plan that was not objected to as part of that Horizontal Capital Review or CCAR process. Looking out beyond that, I would say that the activity that relates to managing the capital position of the balance sheet, will be dependent upon the underlying stress as measured in the portfolio by our models and the macroeconomic scenario that is defined in that stress testing process.", "David Long", "Okay, got it. Yes, I was looking out to the next process in 2018 and any adjustments you may be making on the asset side of the balance sheet here before we get to that process again.", "Paul Burdiss", "I think, we have -- over the course of the last several years, through our concentration management process, through our investment portfolio management activity, I think that we have managed our balance sheet to a good place as it relates to stress testing. And I think you've seen that in steadily improving stress testing results over the course of the last couple of years. So as I look out over the next couple of quarters and balance sheet adjustments that may be required, I'm not seeing any.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Harris, you mentioned this but certainly opening it up for everyone, you mentioned that you're being very disciplined with your core deposit pricing. But if I read your release correctly, your core deposits are actually going down. Your short-term wholesale borrowing is going up. Can you just help us understand why is shrinking your core and increasing wholesale the right decision to make?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, what we're trying to watch is -- and I likened it to -- I don't know if this is a good analogy or not but a pot of water starting to boil. I mean, you see the first few little bubbles, it gets hotter, then it really starts to get into a boil. And I think we're sort of at that stage where we've had some increases over the last year that are certainly creating an environment where, particularly larger depositors, are finding it worthwhile -- they're looking around at alternatives. We are sweeping a lot of -- the very largest depositors, we're sweeping some of that over into money market mutual funds. We think we can get that back, but there's a price to do that. And so listen, I mean, at some point, the pace is going to pick up in terms of raising deposit prices across the industry. The question is just kind of whether you're at the front of that train or the back of the train. I think we're going tend to be toward the back of the train.", "So part of the cost of keeping rates low is you start to lose some of those more rate-sensitive deposits from -- particularly from larger depositors. And that's something we're talking about all the time, and I suspect every other bank is, too. There's probably about as much art as science to the thing because it's what can you change on the margin without repricing the entire deposit base, which is -- but ultimately, that's -- with further rate hikes, you'll start to see more of that. So in the early innings, you're going to see much less deposit beta than you are if rates continue to rise. And that's about the best I can explain it. I -- some of it, talk about the core deposits, I think, Paul was right, if you get under the hood and look at what's the stickiest, they are the smaller accounts. As they get larger, you're having a little more challenge holding on to some of those on the margin. And so that's just kind of -- a little description of kind of artistically how we think about it.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Okay. No, that helps. And then just the other question, in terms of the hurricane losses, are we done with sort of the noncredit-related hurricane costs? And even on the credit side, like how soon will you know what the actual losses are? I mean, how long does that process take?", "Harris Simmons", "I think just -- let me just take -- on the noncredit side, I think the only thing that will be a little -- I mean, it's a very modest continuing drag, we mentioned, that we made. We've made about $5 million noninterest-bearing loans to employees. And so you'll have -- that will effectively be a nonearning asset as those amortize off, but that's pretty modest. On the other side...", "Scott McLean", "Ken, this is Scott. I don't -- in the grants we were making and housing allowances, I think that has pretty much subsided. And so on the credit side, we'll be able to assess that $34 million reserve really, I think, over the next 3 quarters. We'll -- we'll have pretty good visibility on it at the end of the fourth quarter and then -- but I expect that story will be over by the second quarter of next year, one way or the other.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank.", "David Rochester", "Just a question on the expense guidance real quick. It sounds like you're talking about potentially this level bouncing around a little bit here. I know you said stable, but in order to hit that 2% to 3% adjusted expense growth this year. It seems like you need to step down a little bit in 4Q. And it sounds like that $6 million in Harvey-related expense is largely gone in 4Q. Is that generally what you're envisioning here when you're talking about the trend going forward?", "Paul Burdiss", "Dave, it's Paul, I'd say that's generally true. The outlook -- as you know, the 4-quarter outlook in the prepared remarks, we combine that with a view of 2017 calendar, which we said was going to be within that 2% to 3%. So I think you've done the math appropriately there. And then, with respect to the last question and kind of going back to Ken's last question, that's right, the Harvey things, we believe, that we are fully accrued for any incremental expense associated with Hurricane Harvey, and that occurred in the third quarter.", "David Rochester", "And can you just talk about the offsets on the expense side because it seems like you're guiding to an expense growth rate that's a little bit less than what you had guided to for 2017, the 2% to 3%? Can you just talk about where you're seeing those saves? I know you kind of headlined that a little bit last quarter but maybe a little bit more detail would be great.", "Paul Burdiss", "I don't -- correct me if I'm wrong here, but I don't think that we're guiding to a lower number. I think we've been pretty consistent that we would -- expenses would be moderately increasing. If you go back to June 2015, we've said expenses would be moderately increasing. In 2017, we referred to refine that to say 2%, 3% this year. And so we're sticking by that guidance.", "David Rochester", "Yes. I meant for over -- I guess, in terms of 2018, it sounded like you were guiding to less expense growth in 2018 than you were in 2017, that's what I meant.", "Paul Burdiss", "I think we have used -- we have not defined in percentage terms what to expect in 2018 yet, but I'd say that we're using similar language for 2018 as we used in 2017. We'll give more color next quarter on that, Ken -- or Dave.", "David Rochester", "So just one more quick one. You've mentioned the economy in Houston is running, in some ways, stronger than it was before. I was just wondering if you're expecting any potential uptick, particularly on the deposit growth side as a result of the rebuild efforts, and how big could that impact be.", "Scott McLean", "Dave, this is Scott. If you look at the loan growth in Texas over the last year and over the last quarter, it's been really a solid contributor to the company. Clearly, it's not energy-related, it's not oilfield services-related, it's just solid C&I and consumer growth. They've been doing a terrific job in that regard. It's having a nice impact on the overall company. And I think we would just say that, that ought to continue. I think their pipelines are looking pretty good. And you'll see working capital revolvers funding probably more than they have as activities picks up and certainly some reconstruction opportunities. We don't think of it as some windfall growth opportunity, but I think it will be a solid source of continued growth out of the Texas market.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Steve Moss with FBR.", "Stephen Moss", "Following up on the C&I loans, I was just wondering if you can give a little more color as to what were the drivers this quarter.", "Paul Burdiss", "It's interesting because we've got a really diversified C&I portfolio, and largely, average loan size is really small. So there's all sorts of things that go into that. I believe we have a slide in the appendix, Slide 29, that provides a little more color as to kind of geographically where the loans are coming from. But because of the nature of the portfolio, it would be really hard for me to ascribe any 1 or 2 kind of trends or industries that are driving that. I would characterize it as pretty broad.", "Scott McLean", "Well, I think it sort of describes our company, quite frankly. If you look at that on Slide 29, particularly third quarter '17 versus second quarter '17, it's just good, solid across-the-board growth. And in some of our smaller markets, you will have some large payoffs that skew growth in any particular quarter. But you see the same trend on a year-to-date -- on a full year-over-year basis, too, so -- but you really see it here in the third quarter, it's just nice, solid growth across the company.", "Stephen Moss", "Okay. And then my second question, wondering where are new money loans yields today versus your booked deals? And what your thoughts are on the margin going forward.", "James Abbott", "Steve, this is James. The new money yields are about consistent. Some of them are coming in at levels that are somewhat dilutive to the overall portfolio. And those would be on the higher credit quality characteristics of the loans that we're accepting today as opposed to some of the old loans that are rolling off. So there's a little bit of headwind, and maybe 1-or-so basis points of loan yield dilution per quarter is explained by that, if that helps. So high 3s.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.", "John Pancari", "Back to the expenses, I've got your guidance that you've provided here for 2018 and looking at the efficiency ratio. I know you're low 60s for full year '17. Below 60, I know, Paul, you mentioned consistently through '19. So about where do you think the breakpoint is, where it breaks 60%? Is that -- is it fair to assume that it happens at some point midyear? Just trying to get -- of '18? Just trying to get an idea of the trajectory there, when we can -- how we can expect that will play out.", "Paul Burdiss", "John, thanks for your question. We chose those words deliberately. The -- as you correctly point out, we expect to be in the low 60s this year. And by the time we get into 2019, we're expecting to operate at below 60. And obviously, implied by that, there will be a transition point. But we have -- we're not providing any more specific guidance yet as it relates to efficiency ratio in 2018.", "John Pancari", "Okay, all right. And then separately, just around the -- back to the loan growth topic, I know the -- in terms of the outlook around demand, have you given us any color yet around the pipeline and line utilization? I know you said it's very granular, the trends you're seeing. But just want to get an idea, if you are seeing a broader pickup in demand, is this optimism that some of the borrowers had been commenting on post the elections is it starting to play out? What are you seeing there? Is there a general uptick?", "Scott McLean", "I think like most other banks have reported, the postelection optimism hasn't really resulted in a groundswell of loan demand, but -- just simply from that. But generally speaking, across all of our affiliates, their pipelines are in pretty good shape, and we think our model of trying to get to mid-single-digit growth is very achievable. We'll also see, again, 1 to 4 family and CRE growing -- 1 to 4 family growing nicely, and CRE will grow modestly. But it should be good balance mix. And again, all of our affiliates are reporting good pipelines.", "James Abbott", "Yes, John, this is James, I'll just add briefly to Scott's comment that we're seeing positive results from the streamlining of our small business banking initiatives, and that's resulting in some much stronger pull-through rates. So the origination volume is translating into actual balance growth now for some of those small loans at a much faster pace than it was before. So that's another area where, when you peel back the onion several layers, you get down into that size, you can definitely see it starting to emerge. And hopefully, the trend will continue.", "Harris Simmons", "I would just add, if you just look at Slide 29, you'll see that the term commercial real estate combined with national real estate, which is a combination of both term CRE plus owner occupied CRE, the combination of them, they're down $545 million year-over-year. The National Real Estate portfolio probably continues to run off a little bit. I mean, the pace of attrition continues to slow somewhat. But that's really a secondary market, and a lot of community banks, just they're all anxious to hold on to good earning assets. And so the supply of product there is not as great as it used to be. So that will continue to run down a little bit. The term commercial real estate, our general objective has been to have that growing at a pace that is less than the growth we're seeing in the portfolio overall, just over time, to rebalance the portfolio somewhat away from CRE. And it's actually been running down this last 12 months. I don't expect that, that trend of absolute runoff continues the same way over the next 12 months.", "So I think that will be less of a headwind. That should help. But it's still a tough market out there. I mean, we've seen better loan growth than most others, but it's week to week. It's like every Monday morning, I look at last week's production and the net change, and it's a weekly cliffhanger as to whether...", "Scott McLean", "It's the first e-mail we all open on Monday mornings. In fact, it's now coming on Friday nights occasionally, but they know we want to see it. The only other thing I'd add is that we've set out on -- when we've been out on the road, I maybe even said it last quarter, that energy -- the energy portfolio has been declining about $400 million to $500 million per year the last couple of years. And for the next 12 months, we anticipate that portfolio to be flat to potentially up. So that drag should be removed and may even be a modest support -- growth supporter.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin Barker", "In regards to the asset sensitivity, you put out quite a bit of disclosure. So it's been very granular, we appreciate that. But looking back at the NIM expansion that we've seen in the last year, obviously, there were some headwinds from the changes in your balance sheet due to growth in the securities portfolio and the growth in debt. If you were to replay the past year, assuming no changes in your securities balances or your debt balances, would your NIM be significantly above where it is right now, given deposit beta has been very, very low compared to your interest rate sensitivity disclosures?", "Paul Burdiss", "I want to be clear I understand the question. Are you asking us to sort of go back and reset what the net interest margin would have been had we not purchased the securities? Is that what you just said?", "Kevin Barker", "Yes.", "Paul Burdiss", "The NIM would not be below, in fact, the NIM would be -- not be above. The NIM would, in fact, be below where it is today. Think about where we've been buying these bonds. We've been buying them at like 2%, 2.25%, and the fed funds rate has risen from 25 basis points to 125 basis points. So even in the best possible outcome, the yield that we're getting on the securities far exceeds what the yield on the cash would have been.", "Kevin Barker", "So if you were to replay that right now, and assuming your interest rate sensitivity on the balance sheet, would you expect -- continue to expect a significant increase in the NIM going forward, if we were to have another 75 basis points move in the fed?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, the trick in our disclosures, and James and I have been talking a lot about how we talk about this, we've tried to talk about it, and the view is that we disclose a interest rate sensitivity that's based upon a 200 basis point parallel rate shock, which is generally the industry standard. However, every bank, I think, is sensitive to different points of the curve. And the parallel rate shock is really important here because what we've actually observed has been more of a twist kind of a bare flattener, where the short end of the curve has risen while the longer end of the curve has remained flat. And that, in fact, creates a pretty different outcome as it relates to changes in net interest income or margin related to changes in rates. And so we, absolutely, and I certainly stand by our disclosures as it relates to the parallel rate shock. The point that I'd like to make is that, in fact, what we're observing has not been a parallel rate shock, which is why maybe you have not seen the full amount of that \"interest sensitivity\" flow through to net interest income in any given quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth Usdin", "Paul, if I could follow up on that. So if the loans are becoming a bigger proportion of earning assets from here, can that mix improvement more than overcome the expected increase in funding cost going forward before we consider any additional rate hikes?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes, Ken, I, actually, think about it a little differently. I think bank interest sensitivity is generally driven by the liability side of the balance sheet as much or more than the asset side. So I would say, going forward, as it relates to loan growth, the way those loans are funded are going to be really important. And continued control and management of deposit beta and continued high-quality relationship deposit growth is really what is, I would expect, to drive net interest income, particularly in a changing rate environment.", "Kenneth Usdin", "So okay. Then, I guess, the second question is just then, if we were to get more rate hikes, what do you think the benefit would be of the next one, given a gradual increase in beta from here?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, as I said, it kind of depends, and this is -- you're going to hate my answer probably, but it kind of depends on what happens to the rest of the curve. If the short-term rates go up and long-term rates stay stable or go down, that's going to have a very different outcome than if you saw a 25 or a 50 basis point shift across the curve. Generally, our asset sensitivity is pretty linear. That is to say, if you saw a 25 basis point shift across the curve, you could take our 200 basis point disclosure, divide it by 8, and come up with a decent proxy for the annual effect. But as I said, the real trick is predicting what happens in probably the kind of 2 to 7 part of the curve.", "Kenneth Usdin", "So then give me one little liberty then. Do you expect core loan growth to be above or below your core relationship-based deposit growth?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, that's really hard to predict. And I am certainly hopeful that we are going to continue to grow deposits, high-quality core deposits, that is -- at a rate that is close to our loan growth. But I think that's increasingly difficult for all banks in this environment.", "Scott McLean", "But we have done that traditionally.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.", "Gary Tenner", "I wanted to just go back to loan growth for a second and maybe specific to the oil and gas portfolio, just very little runoff this quarter, certainly, as opposed to what we saw a year ago. So can you talk about kind of where -- with where energy prices are today and going through the redetermination period now in the fall, kind of what your thoughts are around utilization -- or excuse me, around commitment levels kind of getting through the fourth quarter and the appetite and demand for loans in that business.", "Scott McLean", "Sure. We have clearly had a remix of our book. Energy services is now down to about 20% of our total energy loans. It was closer to 40% when we started the downturn in the end of 2014. And so we are seeing new underwritings on the reserve base side and the midstream side. We really don't do downstream financing, never have, and we don't plan on changing that materially. So we're just seeing really good solid reserve base loans and midstream, and we'll probably see utilization going up because they're at -- at these prices, there is good activity going on. And so it wouldn't -- again, we think our energy outstandings will at least be flat, possibly go up from here, but it should be a nice growth portfolio for us over time because it's a business we've been in and we're going to stay in, and we know the best people in the industry, and we know how to underwrite it, and the underwriting characteristics are as good as they've ever been right now.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Marlin Mosby", "I wanted to look at the share count and the warrants. And you gave a great disclosure in the appendix of the presentation. But to take your share count from last year, 205 million, up to this year of 209 million shares, and then if you look at the stock price going from below $35 up towards $46, looks like you would estimate about 8 million shares that came out of that. So if you adjust the 209 million for that 8 million to be down to 201 million, so you would've gone from 205 million to 201 million. Is that really the dynamic? Is that pretty close to the relationship of how all that works?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, yes, Marty, I think that's right. As you know, there are other things that impact fully diluted shares. We highlight this as a pretty big one because it clearly has been moving the needle lately and will probably continue to do so. But generally, that is correct.", "Marlin Mosby", "And then on the interest rate section, swap-wise, did you start putting any new swaps on this quarter? Or are you still kind of waiting to see interest rates start to shake out for -- kind of affecting that next part of the plan?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes, this gets to the, I think, the conversation around the shape of the curve. It's really hard for us, the ALCO committee, to get excited about extending duration on a purely interest rate perspective, that is on interest rate swaps, when we see the curve only providing really fractions of a percentage point for going out a couple of years along the curve. So it's a really long answer to your question, which is no, we are not putting swaps on, we're just -- we don't see the value of extending the duration today at that point of the curve.", "Marlin Mosby", "So you'll just look for the right time when that yield curve gets a little bit better. And it's gotten a lot better in the last, let's call it, 6 weeks.", "Paul Burdiss", "That's all relative, Marty.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Chris Spahr with Wells Fargo.", "Christopher Spahr", "I have a couple of questions on expenses. First question is when does the management compensation and discretionary bonus plan kick in relative to the efficiency ratio for this year? And what is the threshold for the comp plan to kind of pay out or not pay out?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, when you say when does it kick in, it's actually incorporated into incentive plans that were put in place back early in the year and as well as, actually, plans that have been put in place the prior couple of years. So -- and those are sort of defined longer-term plans can also impact kind of the total amount of the pool available for more discretionary kinds of annual bonuses. So it's something everybody's kind of thinking about and focused on and something that we take into account as we're accruing toward to what we think the payouts out of these things are going to be. And the second part of the question was?", "Christopher Spahr", "Just what exactly is the efficiency threshold that you guys target? I think you mentioned the low 60s, but I'm just kind of curious on the...", "Harris Simmons", "There is not a -- we haven't, at least publicly, defined a specific target for that for this year other than low 60s. I mean, you have to put this in the context of where we started a couple of years ago. There's been a lot of progress. But it is not a -- it's a factor that is taken into consideration in these plans but not with a specific on-off switch around a particular number.", "Scott McLean", "And so this year is directionally consistent with what we did in '16 and the second half of '15, but -- it's directionally consistent but slightly different in the sense that we had very specific dollar amount targets and ratio targets in '16 and the second half of '15, and they were very much constraining variables on incentive comp. And we think about that this way this year, except we've described it as low 60s, and it is quite different.", "Harris Simmons", "Yes, there's a little more flexibility around it this year than was the case say last year.", "Christopher Spahr", "And the quarter-over-quarter increase in salaries, that was all related to healthcare?", "Paul Burdiss", "There was -- as we highlighted in the -- I think in the press release and certainly the slides, there was a health care benefit component of that increase.", "Christopher Spahr", "Okay. And then finally, last question, on the year-over-year expense number for 2018, slightly higher. I don't know if I've seen that language for expense guidance before. Is that like 0% to 1%?", "Paul Burdiss", "We haven't defined sort of the -- through a Rosetta Stone what exactly that means yet, although I expect we will. If you go back to June of 2015, what we said was that expenses would be modestly higher in '17 than '16. And we ultimately defined that as 2% to 3%. And so I would expect maybe a little more definition around that. As you can imagine, we're getting through our budgeting process and planning process right now. So as we get into the fourth quarter earnings call in January, my expectation is we'll provide a little bit more guidance around what that -- how to interpret that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations, for closing comments and remarks.", "James Abbott", "Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We really appreciate your attendance. And if you have further follow-up questions, I'll be around this evening for a couple more hours and then we'll be available throughout the quarter to respond to e-mails or phone calls. Thank you so much for your participation, and thank you for your interest in Zions.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference.

And thank you for your patience. You joined Zions Bancorporation's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.", "James Abbott", "Thanks Latif, appreciate it. And I would clarify that the conference call is being recorded. And good evening to all of you. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2017 fourth quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide brief overview of key strategic and financial objectives. After which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook for the next four quarters.", "Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; and other Zions executives who are available to address your questions during the question-and-answer session.", "I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although, actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.", "The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call, contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services' analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures, are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.", "We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour. During the question-and-answer session of the call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.", "With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.", "Harris Simmons", "Thank you, James. And we welcome all of you to our call today to talk about our fourth quarter and full year results. I am going to go through a few of the slides, beginning with the deck we\u2019ve provided to you. On slide three are some highlights for the quarter.", "At a high level, we were really pleased with the performance of both quarter and the year. We established some very specific financial targets back in early 2015 that included some goals for 2017. We achieved those goals and today the Company is substantially more profitable. We eliminated considerable amount of inefficiency, and we've transformed a lot of our operations to be simpler and easier for both our employees and customers. But we are not finished. Our culture of identifying ways to simplify and streamline is firmly established around the company, and we plan to deliver continuous improvement in operational and financial efficiency in quarters and years to come, while investing in areas that we expect should result in a healthy rate of revenue and earnings growth.", "Looking specifically at the quarter, we experienced continued strong growth in earnings per share, up about 33% from the year ago period, if adjusted to exclude a couple of items that were directly related to the change in the federal tax law. We were pleased with loan growth, which increased 5% over the year ago period, which compares to about 2.2% for large domestic commercial banks. We were able to push the efficiency ratio down to 61.6%. But is excluding the larger charitable contribution that we detail on slide three, it would have been actually just under 60% for the quarter.", "For the full year, efficiency ratio was 61.7%. Again, is excluding the larger charitable contribution and the expense associated with the Hurricane Harvey, which we detailed last quarter.", "A quick note about the contribution, the charitable contribution. We contribute several million dollars per year as part of our contribution to our communities. And we expect to make additional contributions in 2018 and beyond, outside of this unusually large contribution. And this large contribution and fourth quarter will displace some of the expenditures that we would otherwise be making in 2018 in succeeding year. So we\u2019ll be doing portions through our income statement and a portion through the foundation. But in combination, we don\u2019t expect to be ramping up our charitable contribution spending, we simply front-end loaded some of that back into 2017.", "We remained disciplined with the pricing of funding. Our so called deposit beta or the increase in the cost of deposits expressed as a percentage of the increase and the cost of federal funds rate, was only 3% during the quarter. And our funding beta, which includes the cost of borrowings, was 14%; the combination of those two factors led to healthy increase in sustainable net interest income, up approximately 10% over the prior year fourth quarter.", "With regard to credit quality, we've remained pleased with continued strong improvement, including a 9% linked quarter decline in classified loans and 12% linked quarter decline in non-performing assets, including loans that are 90 days or more past due, and only 11 basis points of annualized net charge-offs.", "Loans outside of the oil and gas loan portfolio experienced another remarkably good year with only two 100s of a percent or 2 basis points of loan losses as a percentage of average loans if you exclude the single commercial credit that was subject to a department of justice investigation in the first quarter, or 9 basis points if you include that credit.", "On slide four, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue reflect steady improvement, up 19% from the year-ago quarter. And it's a previously referenced larger charitable contributions excluded pretax pre-provision net revenue, increased 25% from a year-ago quarter. Some of the growth is due to the benefits of securities purchases, which we do not expect to be as significant contributor to growth over the foreseeable future. However, we do expect continued moderate loan growth and customer related fee income growth, combined with continued expense discipline, which should contribute to further positive operating leverage. And if the Federal Open Market Committee continues to raise the federal funds rate, we would expect further improvement in our pretax pre-provision net revenue. Although, that benefit is not included in our guidance or outlook.", "As we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, the rate of growth seems likely the slow. Although, we still expect the strong rate of growth.", "Turning to slide five, I've already highlighted the efficiency ratio in my earlier comments. But visually, this represents all the work we've done since 2014 to improve the profitability of the Company. We expect to push to achieve an efficiency ratio below 60% for the full year 2019, excluding the possible benefits of rate increases.", "Slide six depicts two key profitability metrics, return on assets and return on tangible common equity. Return on assets was 74 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 88 basis points a year ago. However, excluding the larger charitable contribution and revaluation of the deferred tax asset, return on assets increased to 1.07%. Return on tangible common equity was 7.4%, but again excluding those two items, it would have been approximately 10.9%. We\u2019re encouraged by the continued improvement and remained focused on achieving competitive returns on our assets relative to peers.", "Moving to slide seven. We experienced 5% year-over-year growth in loans held for investment despite continued attrition in the national real estate portfolio, as well as the term commercial real estate, the oil and gas portfolios. All told attrition was about $550 million or more than a percent of loan growth. ", "We are comfortable with our loan concentrations. The economy is generally strong. We're optimistic that the new tax policy will be helpful to generate growth and we made some improvements in origination process, all of which should contribute to continued moderate loan growth.", "Deposits declined slightly, about 1% over the past year, which is almost entirely due to large dollar deposits rather than middle market or small business to personal accounts. Loan growth outpaced deposit growth over the past year by $2.7 billion, which we funded with incremental wholesale borrowings. We expect to remain disciplined around deposit pricing. We've experienced some pressure on larger dollar deposits, but the majority of our deposits are smaller accounts, both for personal and for business accounts. And therefore, not likely to be as price sensitive in our opinion, as the larger deposit customers are.", "We sweep several billion of customer funds off the balance sheet to asset managers over the course of next few months and quarters, we expect that some of that will return to our balance sheet should be source of funding for earning asset growth.", "With that overview, I'll turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financials in additional detail. Paul?", "Paul Burdiss", "Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide eight. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.54 per diluted share. Here is detail of the couple of key items, so I won\u2019t repeat them here. I will add that we are pleased with the financial performance of 2017, and note that we've successfully delivered on our financial commitment made to you on June 1, 2015.", "Let me make a few comments about revenue. Nearly 80% of our revenue comes from net interest income. Slide nine depicts the recent trend in net interest income, which continue to demonstrate substantial growth in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year period. Net interest income increased $46 million or nearly 10%. Interest income increased approximately $60 million, of which approximately two-thirds came from loans and one-third resulted from the investment portfolio.", "With respect to revenue drivers, I'll discuss earning asset volume first then transition to rates. Although, we don't have a slide on this, as we discussed in the recent past, we do not expect investment portfolio growth, which has been a meaningful contributor to pre-provision net revenue growth over the past several years to contribute significantly to growth in net interest income. The investment portfolio has now grown to the appropriate size relative to the size of our balance sheet.", "Slide 10 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year ago period. The size of the circles represent the relative size of the loan portfolios and the circles are ordered by size, left to right, from smallest to largest portfolios respectively. Total loan growth, including the effects of the declining oil and gas portfolio and the national real estate loan portfolio, was 5%. The key take away from this chart is relatively balanced growth across the loan portfolio. Commercial and industrial owner occupied and home equity loans all increased in the mid single digit range, while we experienced strong growth in one to four family and municipal loans.", "We experienced general stability in construction and land development and term commercial real estate loans. As expected, we experienced declines in oil and gas loans and national real estate loans.", "Shown at the bottom right is our expectation for loan growth by product type. We are comfortable with our commercial real estate concentrations and plan to grow commercial real estate loans at rates which are generally consistent with the overall mid single digit loan growth rates.", "We expect oil and gas loans to stabilize or possibly increase somewhat. And although, we don't expect national real estate portfolio to increase in 2018, we do expect the decline to be relatively minimal compared to prior years.", "Slide 11 breaks down key rate and cost components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which increased three basis points from the prior quarter to 4.30%, and increased 11 basis points over the year ago period. Meanwhile, relative to the year ago quarter, we experienced about two basis points of deal headwind due to reduced benefit from loans purchased from the FDIC.", "New loan production for the fourth quarter was up two basis points higher than the yield on our portfolio. Without future rate hikes, we expect the yield on the loan portfolio to remain generally stable from the current level. Favorable factors include the December rate hike and new loan production, while adverse factors include the tax effect on municipal loans and income from loans purchased from the FDIC back in 2009.", "Harris touched on our deposit and funding costs earlier. But to expand a bit on his comments, the average cost of total deposit increased to 13 basis points from 10 basis points a year ago. During which time, the average federal funds rate has increased 75 basis points, or a so called deposit beta of about 4%. Interest expense, which includes both deposits and borrowings expressed as a percentage of total deposits and borrowings rose 26 basis points from 15 basis points or a 14% funding beta.", "Reflected in the lower left is the change in the mix of earning assets. As a result of this mix shift, we experienced about 3 basis points of margin headwind during the past year due to 2 percentage point lower concentration of loans relative to earning assets.", "The security deal declined slightly. This was primarily due to higher premium amortization on the SBA or small business association loans, administration securities. For those of you who have followed the Company for some time, you've heard us discuss that the SBA securities have a high premium relatively associated with them; and that as the economy improves, we would expect a higher rate of premium amortization due to higher prepayments, which did occur during this past quarter.", "More broadly, we have been reinvesting cash flow from our investment portfolio into securities with a marginally higher yield than the average portfolio yield. Therefore, all else equal, we would expect yield and securities portfolio to increase slightly over the longer term.", "On the right side of the page is a table depicting the percentage of loans that have a shorter term, medium term and longer term interest rate reset base. We have detailed the effective interest rate swaps and floors on the loan portfolio so that you may better understand the possible reaction and timing of yield on the loan portfolio to rising short term rates versus rising longer term rates.", "Overall, our net interest margin should be relatively stable in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter as we expect some benefit from the December 2017 increase and the Fed funds target rate to help. However, this will be offset by the effect of tax reform and its impact on the municipal loan and securities portfolio yield, which we estimate to be about 3 basis points of headwind to net interest margin.", "On slide 12, we show the model effect on net interest income in a rate environment that is 200 basis points immediately higher across the curve relative to the current level. This would generate 5% increase in net interest income, which assumes a 36% deposit beta.", "On the right shows the comparison of this rate rising environment versus the last time we experienced that tightening where the beginning of the ten lines on a quarter immediately before the Fed began to raise rates. For Zions, deposits have been less sensitive so far this cycle as compared to the last, up only 3 basis points relative to the 150 basis points move by the Federal Reserve, as compared to about 25 basis points of higher deposit costs at a comparable point in the prior cycle for a similar move by the Federal Reserve.", "We have a very granular deposit base with a very high ratio of small balance accounts from small and medium sized businesses and a very granular portfolio of consumer deposits. We expect that the increase in our cost of deposits may remain low for the near term.", "Turning to slide 13 and non-interest income. Total non-interest income was $139 million, up from $128 million a year ago. Beginning with customer related fees shown on this slide, we experienced a 9% increase to $127 million from $118 million a year ago. Most lines experienced a favorable improvement relative to the year ago period. Treasury management fees, which are included in deposit service charges, increased about 6% from a year ago period with card and loan fees increasing each about 4%.", "However, retail deposit service charges declined slightly due in part to lower non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees. We've experienced strong performance in wealth management, which includes trust businesses and certain capital markets products.", "Non-interest expense on slide 14 increased to $417 million from $404 million in the year ago quarter. If adjusted for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments and other similar items, non-interest expense increased to $450 million from $395 million in the year-ago period. Furthermore, if one excludes the $12 million incremental contribution for the charitable foundation, as Harris discussed, the adjusted non-interest expense would have been up by only about 2% from the year ago period.", "A few notable points; salaries and employee benefits increased $13 million from the year ago period; this is mostly explained by the substantial improvement in profitability this year versus the last year; and this results in higher profit sharing and incentive compensation pay to employees; relative to the prior quarter, occupancy declined about $6 million; you may recall in the third quarter of 2017, we accrued for estimated property damage associated with Hurricane Harvey in Houston; and as mentioned in the press release, other non-interest expense increased from the prior quarter and year ago quarter due to the larger contribution to the charitable foundation.", "Slide 15 depicts the overall credit quality metrics of our loan portfolio. Harris provided some high level comments earlier, and so I will echo his remarks. We are encouraged with the meaningful improvement in classified loan, non-performing assets and net charge-offs. Much of the improvement came from the oil and gas portfolio and we remain optimistic that we will continue to see further favorable changes due to oil and gas credit measures. Although, not shown in this slide, we have materially and substantially improved the weighted average risk rate on both the commercial real-estate and the commercial loan portfolios during the past five years. And we remain disciplined on our commercial and on our consumer loan underwriting criteria. As such, we expect the manageable credit costs, while much of the provision for credit losses will cover these incremental loan growth.", "Slide 16 is a visual representation of the former tax structure with the federal statutory rate of 35% and our state's statutory rate of about 4.8% pretax or about 3% after tax. And this is presented alongside on our effective tax rate. And the third bar for 2017 excludes items such as the expense associated with the revaluation of the deferred tax assets taken in the fourth quarter and benefits to state tax expense in the first half of the year and reduced tax expenses due to the exercise investing of stock based compensation, which is known as ASU 2016-09.", "On the right side is a representation of what we expect will be the statutory and effective tax rate for 2018 and beyond, with one important caveat. Some of the states in which we do business maybe evaluating their tax structure in reaction to the change in the federal tax law. And thus, we may experience a change to the state tax rate. Nonetheless, we feel comfortable giving an outlook that the 2018 effective tax rate is likely to be between 24% and 25%.", "On slide 17 is a list of our key objectives for 2018 and 2019 and our commitment to shareholders. We are fully committed to continuing to achieve positive operating leverage. We have three years behind us in our effort to materially improve profitability and grow earnings. We remain committed to further improvement and simplification of our operational processes. We expect to continue to experience improvement in the efficiency ratio and that pre-provision net revenue will increase at a rate in the high single-digits.", "This outlook assumes the impact from the change in the tax law on municipal loans and securities and at the higher salaries and bonuses paid to many of our employees. And also contemplates the effect of the December 2017 increase and the Fed funds rate. Although, it does not assume any further increases in net or other benchmark interest rates.", "We expect to continue to invest significantly in technology improvements, which includes the substantial overhaul to our core systems. Back in 2015, we indicated that we are going to be targeting much more substantial returns on capital that could be seen then and we are tracking well towards those goals, although there is still room for improvement.", "Regarding returns of capital, we have increased that amount to a level above the peer median and we view a moderate increase of balance sheet leverage as appropriate, particularly given the reduction of the risk profile of the company. Unless it is often enquire as to the appropriate level of capital and we have responded that the stress testing results are the primary driver and you can see our company run media stress test result on our Web site.", "But to highlight a single number, our post stress common equity tier one ratio was 9.9%, and well above the 4.5% minimum regulatory threshold. A second consideration is where we rank within our peer group. For various reasons, we believe it is important to remain somewhat stronger than the peer median with respect to capital. We recognize that the peer median is likely to decline over time. And so while the peer-median analysis is a relative threshold for us, the stress test is an absolute threshold.", "Now moving to slide 18 and our outlook. We are maintaining an outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which is to be interpreted as an annual growth in the mid-single digits. We expect net interest income to increase moderately over the next 12 months. We assume no additional rate hikes in this outlook. Although, we do incorporate into our view, the December 2017 rate hike. Additional increases in short-term rates are expected to improve net interest income.", "We posted a net provision for credit loss, which includes both funded and unfunded commitments of minus $12 million in the fourth quarter. Asset quality continued to outperform our expectations and that credit costs have been lower than expected, a trend which may continue. However, our base case scenario calls for a modest provision for credit losses over the next several quarters that is greater than zero. In other words, we may experience reserve release as credit quality continues to improve, which may be offset by reserves for new loans and off course ongoing net charge offs.", "Customer-related fees, we expect, which are defined in our press release and exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, should increase slightly from the level reported in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, fee income remains the key focus for the company. Although, the outlook recognized is that the fourth quarter 2017 level was relatively strong.", "Excluding the effect of the $12 million contribution to the Company's charitable foundation, we expect adjusted non-interest expense for 2017 to be slightly higher than the 2017 level. To be clear as shown on page 21 of the earnings release, adjusted non-interest expense was $1.640 billion, less the $12 million contribution, one would arrive at a base rate of $1.628 billion. From which we would expect an increase in the low single digit rate of growth for the full year 2018.", "Excluding stock based compensation, the effective tax rate for full year 2018 is expected to be between 24% and 25% as stated earlier. Preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $34 million over the next four quarters, and diluted shares may fluctuate due to both share repurchases and the dilutive effect from the outstanding warrants. The dilutive effect of the warrants is predominantly dependent upon the future price of the stock. You may see in the appendix further sensitivities on the effected warrants on diluted shares outstanding.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Barker, Piper Jaffray. Your question please.", "Kevin Barker", "You made a quick comment about the securities yield bouncing back higher. Could you walk through that again and some of the reasons why you're starting to see securities yields go back up given we saw quite a bit of decline in the fourth quarter?", "Paul Burdiss", "The decline in the fourth quarter was really related to prepayments we're experiencing on our SBA securities. And as noted in my prepared remarks and as you know, those have a relatively high premium attached to them. So relatively minor changes in prepayments can lead to, I will say relative to the other types of securities, disproportionate changes in yield. So all other things equal, the point that I was trying to make was that the securities that we're buying today actually have a higher yield than the securities that are coming off.", "And so over time, my point was again with similar duration and extension risk kind of characteristics, the yield on the securities that we're buying today have a higher yield than the yield the securities are coming off. And so therefore over time, again all other things equal, we would expect the securities portfolio yield to creep up over time.", "Kevin Barker", "And then also in your guidance for fee income, I noticed you're seeing slightly increasing for customer facing fees. Now, fee income as a whole, has been growing at roughly a 5% clip over the last couple of years. Was there a reason why you're seeing maybe a slight decline there? Or is it just related to the customer fees, in particular.", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, the item there was really related to core fees. And as I tried to say in my prepared comments, the fourth quarter came in pretty strong. And so because specifically that page is a fourth quarter to fourth quarter view, that's really I think what that comment reflects. I will say over time, we are clearly continued to target mid single digit growth in our core fee income.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss of B. Riley. Your line is open.", "Steve Moss", "I was wondering, you just discussed that commercial real estate growth we saw this quarter. Where are you seeing that from here?", "Harris Simmons", "Could you repeat that?", "Scott McLean", "Commercial real estate growth this quarter\u2026", "Harris Simmons", "Where you see it going from here you're saying?", "Steve Moss", "Where you seeing it from here, where are you seeing those sources of growth and where do you know -- or should we expect similar trends in the future here?", "Scott McLean", "This is Scott McLean. I would just say that the portfolio, commercial real estate portfolio in general last year declined as you can see. But we did start to see a pick-up in the fourth quarter and we anticipate growth that should be consistent with the rest of the portfolio throughout 2018. And really we're seeing it across the franchise. And it\u2019s predominantly CRE term as opposed to construction, which is consistent with the mix of our portfolio currently.", "Steve Moss", "And if we were to get another rate hike in March, what would you expect the benefit to the margins to be?", "Scott McLean", "Well, we provide a lot of disclosures around this. So that I can't answer that so that I don't have to answer that question directly, because the answer is because of the effect on the margin is dependent somewhat on also the shape of the curve. And so you can see on the slides that I referenced -- we\u2019ve got about, if I remember right, 40% of our loans in the near term are impacted by the change in rate. Obviously, changes in deposit rates are going to be heavily influenced on the change in the net interest margin. So all that together net-net, you're looking at probably a couple of basis points improvement in the margin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Brad Milsaps", "Harris, I was just curious in 2015 you guys laid out the multiyear efficiency goals, and now it's kind of the primary targets for management and kind of how your incentives are structured. Just kind of curious obviously you still have those efficiency targets out there in the out years [indiscernible], what else is kind of the big driver for you guys? And as a follow-up to that, you've commented in the past that given where rates have been and the amount of capital banks that had have to hold maybe the old measures of returns for banks shouldn't apply anymore. Just kind of curious now what you might be thinking about kind of returns for the industry you guys are now above 1% ROA, still have a lot of capital, but just any additional color in that regard would be helpful?", "Harris Simmons", "Sure. Well, I think in terms of the kind of measures that we're going to be looking at, and I think when we -- if you go back two to three years ago, we -- it was important to focus on something like efficiency ratio. We were way out of the middle to third way in terms of where we should have been probably in -- we've made a lot of progress as we've demonstrated in \u2013 we\u2019ve shown some of the slides here. I think as we get little closer to where the industry is, our focus internally is very much on continuing to work at reducing costs, making -- really making everything we do as efficient as we possibly can.", "I expect that in terms of the efficiency ratio, we will in 2018 see incremental improvement over 2017. It will be at a slower pace as you can -- the obvious. We can't continue the same kind of trend that we earlier -- the same of pace of improvement, but we'll see further improvement. I am quite confident. And internally I think our focus is shifting more towards, how can we grow pretax pre-provision net revenue, which I expect that growth rate to be in the high single digits, somewhere thereabouts. And it's a focus on operating leverage and growth of PPNR, and we're working on a lot of internal initiatives that I think will help us continue the trajectory that we've been on. And again not at same pace we \u2013 there was a lot of low hanging fruit and that becomes tougher as time goes on, but there's still a lot of opportunity.", "As far as capital goes, as Paul mentioned, we've continued to ramp up the payout. And when we announced the merger -- our intent to merge the holding company into the bank, it triggered some questions from some investors as to whether that was going to create a sort of a one-time major adjustment in capital. And we I think communicated to everybody that wasn't our intent. It's really continued to work towards rightsizing capital in a disciplined and orderly way. And certainly looking at what's happening in terms of the economic environment and what's happening to capital levels in the industry generally.", "And with the focus on our own risk profile, I do expect that it will be more focused on our own stress test results that will be a big driver, and we are doing a lot of things internally to produce this sort of - to incorporate those results into how we incentivize structure and pricing and other things and like I expect it will be really good for shareholders. We want to be sure that out on the frontlines that everybody's incentives are aligned in terms of trying to create the best possible structure that protects the bank while also providing pricing that generates adequate return.", "So I guess I'm giving a little just a window into how we are thinking about it, we don\u2019t have any specific goals that we are going to communicate today in terms of what's going to happen our capital levels except that I expect that will continue kind of right size as the balance sheet grows and we continue to pay out capital at somewhat accelerated pace.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Ken Usdin", "Paul, I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of expense growth. First I guess how would you define low single, you help us kind of understand the ranges for the mid you were talking about, but in terms of off of that 16 to 28 days? How would you just help us understand what you consider low single?", "Paul Burdiss", "Ken, we are publicly not super specific there; however, if you and kind of open up the Zions Bancorp or another story, you can see the last year we used a similar return where we are talking about slightly increase and you may recall that expenses increased kind of depending higher measuring it kind of 2% to 3% once you factor in that charitable contribution we discussed. So Ken I'd say it's kind of the net ballpark hopefully that's helpful.", "Ken Usdin", "Yes, and in that 2% to 3% issuing a ballpark. I guess how are you weighing just ongoing programs in terms of the tax spend and then anything incremental on top of what you did in the fourth quarter? And do you have any thought about do you accelerate some of the tech projects? Or do you just keep everything on that long-term seven year plan than you\u2019ve had it on for a long while?", "Scott McLean", "Ken, it's Scott McLean. Let me respond to that part of it. When you look at the expense growth which Paul has just described qualitatively, you described a bit more quantitatively. We -- there are lot of moving parts, we are finding ways to save money all the time based on our simplification initiatives and Harris described, but clearly employment cost is primary driver of the number. And I would just say that we are adding bankers and growth areas particularly number of our strong fee income areas like municipal finance, mortgage, wealth and just to mention a few.", "So, we are adding bankers in our faster growing and fee income areas and we are adding just basic commercial bankers and small business bankers across the franchise so that would be the primary driver there and then the secondary driver would be on a technology cost as you noted and our future core project the replacement of our long systems it's very long system, our three long systems and two deposit systems.", "It's just one of numerous technology projects its probably been the one we talked about most but we're quite spending 20% to 25% of our tax spend this year on advancing our digital capabilities and so there is technology in general is a fundamental driver of the expense number as well. And I would say the comparative 5 or 6 years ago, the investments we're making on the technology side are much more offensive and forward leaning, we're five to six years ago there were much more defensive just trying to keep the shop running appropriately.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open.", "Marty Mosby", "Paul, wanted to ask you about how -- when you look at that by 20, dilutive impact of the warrant, it looks like you kind curve into there is may be diminishing increase as the stock price goes higher. And over the last year share count even though you accelerated share repurchase over last two quarters is still going up because of the impact of these warrants. Is that the goal and expectation that that share count can start now that go down as the impact from higher stock prices becomes a little less?", "Paul Burdiss", "Well, I know your first point you got a very sharp eye Marty although I would say that that curve is probably not overly pronounced. I would describe there is more linear then curve but it is slightly curved. So as I said in my prepared remarks depending upon the kind of continued reaction of our share price to again some pretty significantly improved fundamentals you have over the last couple of years. All other things equal obviously, if the share price doesn\u2019t move from here then we would expect the share repurchases to have much more direct impact on diluted shares outstanding. It's just what we have been experiencing off course is a share price increase that has been -- that is exceeded our ability under our capital plan to go out and buy back stock.", "Marty Mosby", "And then the other thing that\u2019s really just much more of a suggestion as we -- you were highlighting Investor Day coming up here shortly. That with the technology spend that you're talked about, there has been such a significant project. They've really been able to talk about because you don\u2019t see those expenses in the short run, they really get capitalized and then they kind run out overtime. But to really kind outline, one, what are the benefits that you're beginning to see and how that they start to really kick in? And then two how much we kind behind the scene capitalizing eventually is going to start amortize as the systems going to play?", "Scott McLean", "Marty, it's Scott. It\u2019s a great point and we do plan on focusing on that as well as our simplification initiatives is well on Investor Day. Thanks to many subjects we will talk about.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "The decision to move away from the holding company structure to something simpler, could you talk a bit about how you made that decision and in particular on timing why announced when there is a legislative process underway that could result in significantly reduced regulation one a way until you see the outcome of that and then decided dropping the whole curve as the bank think to do?", "Harris Simmons", "Sure. I would say that the process began about a year and a half ago, and as we were made the decision to consolidate the various charters that we had -- we had I think we call seven different banking subsidiaries and that required a holding company. Once we consolidated the charters I guess I sort of asking myself the question in the name of simplifying life. I ask myself what was the benefit in having a bank holding company. And particularly as we look at our presence and perspective mix of businesses and operations, what can be done in a bank? What can\u2019t be done in a bank? And frankly, virtually everything we're doing operationally in terms of business lines of business can be done in a bank.", "Now in times past there were some things that you could do some of which are now prohibited by the Walter rule for example and also we've been winding down some of those investments and but you know the likelihood that we're going to find ourselves underwriting the equities and we're engaging in merchant banking and you know there's a domestic commercial bank. There's precious little in my view that you can really do with a holding company that you can't do in a bank, and that small set of things that you can do in a holding company are probably best left to very-very large companies.", "And so that was the mindset as we set about investigating the opportunity, I can that I probably spent more time working on this legislation than any banker in America and so I mean I talked to a lots of Congressmen I think I know business landscape pretty well. And I'm highly in favor of the legislation and I think that I hoped that the Crapo bill will pass. But it's sort of dawn on us that it couldn't deliver one thing that merging a holding company into the bank could deliver and that was eliminating duplicate regulator altogether so the Crapo bill, they set the threshold at $250 billion will certainly be helpful to a lot of banks in terms of you know being subject to the Fed's stress test their models etc, but should still have in our case the OCC and the federal reserve coming in and performing examinations.", "And I think most anyway you cut it, we said there's a lot of overlap in what they're doing and so that's fundamentally where we said we think that this is ultimately what the you know the right thing to do because it will give us good supervision, regulation, but it won't give us duplicate regulation every time we turnaround, which we've been seeing increasingly in recent years. So, that's fundamentally the reason behind it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JP Morgan. Your question please.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "I'd like to start regarding the corporate tax rate coming down for your commercial customers. I'd imagine that as cash flows improve on a net basis, you might see upgrades and the need for reserve. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and if that could have a material impact on credit quality?", "Harris Simmons", "Yes, the jury out on that, obviously, and there's also speculation among some of our -- some of the larger borrowers in the economy which as you know we don't generally lend to our clients particularly on the commercial side are some kind of small business and smaller and middle markets. There's some of those may take extra cash either coming from offshore otherwise to use that to pay down debt. I am not personally -- I don't think we're expecting a big effect of that on our core client base, nor are we expecting because again our clients look different than the much larger clients, nor are we expecting a material change in the credit quality. Although there's a lot yet to be seen I think as the effect of the tax legislation shakes through the economy.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Then an unrelated question on C&I loan growth, Zions Bank saw a $200 million decline quarter-over-quarter but you had nice growth in CB&T. Can you give a little color on each of those?", "Paul Burdiss", "Yes, there was a lot of activity at quarter end and I just -- in fact I don't have the details. I don't know that we could give you that color at the moment. We may be able to at our Investor Day give you a little more insight.", "James Abbott", "Steven, this is James, I'll just jump in with a little bit though as it, there've been some loans that have been maturing or being rebooked as they mature from some of our large scale part utility type of deals that are being rebooked in the geographies in which they exist. So, historically for example some alternative energy lending and types of things have been booked within Utah Bank. And that those some of that's being moved to California where it is actually based geographically but -- so there would be some of it.", "Harris Simmons", "There would be a piece of it, but not a great big piece in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ken Zerbe", "Just going back to the efficiency ratio. In the press release, you mentioned the 60% for 2019 as well. Can you just give us a little background -- just remind us, is there any fundamental reason why your efficiency ratio should be sustainably higher than a lot of the other sort of similar sized peers, because a lot of the banks of around your size are coming out with target somewhere like the mid -- call it mid to low 50s give or take just as a technology piece? Does it go down after all of your the future core spending slows? Just trying to understand the farther long term look?", "Harris Simmons", "I guess I -- listen I'd say that, it's hard to speak to where they think they are going to get that kind of additional boost to get some down and to the low 50. So I think as we look at the peer group, which we measure I think which we measure our progress, we're getting to a point where we are closing in on sort of the median. We are at 61.6% for 2017 going into 2018, there are couple of headwinds as noted the lower tax benefit on the legacy municipal, securities and loans portfolio combined with that the bonuses and salary growth that we announced about the end of the year combines throughout 90 basis points that's about 90 basis points of efficiency ratio.", "So that's some out of the headwind and we think despite that we're going to get a challenge to somewhere closer to 60 basis points. And I guess it gets incrementally more difficult but I think we get down I think very much within the kind of at least the middle of the pack it's not better overtime than our peer group. I do think but there are couple of things that our headwinds one is the technology stand that we've talked about that's about $35 million roughly going through the income statement annually on replacing core systems off course as Scott mentioned were also spending money on digital etcetera.", "The other is that we have a the profile of our commercial loan portfolio is decidedly different from a lot of our peers it is smaller to the medium size of any commercial loan here is decidedly smaller than what you would see in the most of our peers and that's a little more expensive model I think to run but I think it also produces some benefits in terms of that kind of deposit base and we have and traditionally the kinds of loan yields that at the end we will achieve. So I don\u2019t know exactly how to measure that against peers, but I think that's probably a factor. But I think nevertheless we're going to find ourselves very close to where peers are already here within the next 24 months.", "Paul Burdiss", "If I can just jump in there Ken, I've just as of Friday the peer consensus efficiency ratio for 2019 was about 58.5% so were our goals are not substantially different from that I would tell you and that's consistent with what Harris just said. The top cortile is about 57% so there is not a huge range between the peer groups that we said is planned today.", "Harris Simmons", "And just to continue within that topic I know that couple of other things one is the effective tax while change is going to be about a 90% and that was 90 basis points increase in our efficiency ratio that's number one. And then you refer back to the press release which is Page 4 where we talk about inefficiency ratio that kind of near is 60%. I would note that could be higher or lower and so I would ask you to keep that in mind also and reference to what just what James just said kind of peer group relative.", "And it sounds like the peers I think have not been doing necessarily a near-term, but more of our medium and longer term efficiency ratio outlook and just to be really clear that\u2019s not what we provided here. What we're trying to express is that to a continued growth and pro provision of that revenue our efficiency ratio is going to continue to decline and improve.", "Ken Zerbe", "And just as a follow up. After you really -- your slide deck on provision expense obviously has negative this quarter. The way of it reads I know you say modest there, but is it possible you could have either quarter or several quarters where between further oil and gas reserve release and Hurricane Harvey again, you could actually have sort of persistently negative provision at least for some short period during the year?", "Paul Burdiss", "This is Paul. I would say as frankly its possible, as we said, as we noted here there may be some releases as credit quality continues to improve and we had seen a fairly long line of continued credit quality improvement and charge offs would have been very good until we provide incremental growth, to the extent we have charge offs even that recoveries in some cases that\u2019s absolutely possible.", "Ken Zerbe", "Okay thank you.", "James Abbott", "And so this is James. We're at the end of about an hour, so we do have few questions to go so its lighting round variety here and we will just pick one primary question and one. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thanks. So the next question comes from Emlen Harmon of JMP Securities. Your line is open.", "Emlen Harmon", "More I've got queued for you as a couple of parts, so we can do a quick follow up from that. Just in terms of bringing the money market balances on to the balance sheet, how much of that do you plan to relay to drive deposit growth and just what's the potential impact on deposit yields?", "Harris Simmons", "Well, we haven't been very specific about that and it is identified as an opportunity. And we expected to be a significant part of our funding strategy over the course of next several quarters, as we said. But we now had provided specifics with respect to how that may affect over our yields, though I would say, I mean you can kind look at our wholesale borrowings and what is yield is on that, you can see that I think Page 17 in the press release and recognize that we would be bringing these on at a rate which is better than where we borrowing in the wholesale market.", "Operator", "Next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open.", "John Pancari", "On the tax benefit just wanted to get your thought on how much of this benefit is likely to accrete to the bottom line and stay there? Or how much would you say that you're putting back in the business or ultimately going to get more competitive with?", "Paul Burdiss", "I'll take a stab otherwise. I find myself thinking about pretty much like deposit basis I guess. Whole like you can go on to, we're not deliberately going out and using it to try and buy market share. I think overtime the way markets work is that, it will -- a major portion of it probably dissipate end of way. But I think that will take a little bit of time. And so I think will capture most of that benefit 2018 incrementally less as we go along its markets just. This is one of these high class problems that corporate America haven't have the rest of which for very long-time so.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Dave Rochester", "Just one quick one on expenses. I know you guys mentioned giving some more detail later on the simplification effort. But can you just give an update on whether you still see that as a multiyear opportunity to control expense growth? And are you expecting any rate sensitivity in that expense growth guidance, meaning, if we were to see a bunch of rate hikes? Could that possibly allow for some expense growth for you?", "Scott McLean", "Dave, this is Scott McLean. I just think as we talk more at the Investor Day about the, what simplification is look like in our company. I happen to believe that the -- we're just getting started, we made a lot of really good progress in big areas, but we have a lot of other areas and now there's a lot of energy around this subject has been. And I think we're getting more effective in executing more quickly on creating change, and everyone of those simplification processes -- in many cases, it reduces cost but in some cases it increases revenue, certainly has an impact on customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. So I think as we talk more about that story and tell that story more appropriately I think you'll -- think most investors will be encouraged by it.", "Dave Rochester", "Great. Thanks and then.", "Scott McLean", "I'm sorry you mentioned the expense growth -- sorry, you know we would have to see really solid core revenue growth coming from things other than just interest rate changes. I think we're driven by a loan deposit pre-income growth, as long as those fundamentals are increasing we'll probably lean into those businesses and in terms of supporting people and technologies. But just getting increased rate benefit I think we'll be very conscious of not spending that away inappropriately.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Chris Spahr of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Chris Spahr", "My question is regard to your fee income and this seems to be one of the best core fee income numbers that you put up and I guess in the history of the firm, at least you've been a customer related fee income yet your guidance for next year really hasn't changed that much, and almost implied like a lower level of run rate that you posted in the fourth quarter. So what happened in the fourth quarter that was better than expected? And what can you do to kind of kick start fee income to kind of at least change your outlook on that line?", "Scott McLean", "Sure, thank you. This is Scott. This is where quarter-over-quarter comparisons to get a little out of whack. We felt great about the fourth quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of last year, but it's really 12 months run rates as we look at and that mid single digit growth rate is what we're still guiding to. But this fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of '16, we just saw you know really strong numbers in those two quarterly comparisons related to our normal workhorse fee income categories like treasury management, bank card. But we saw some really unusual increases in municipal finance, foreign exchange and a number of others that our wealth business that just happened to have really strong 4Q versus 4Q comparisons. Having said all that, I think if we can put up 5% mid single digit growth rate numbers in fee income, these are very basic products. We are not selling investment banking or exotic capital markets activities, and so these are generally businesses that grow kind of mid single digit growth rates.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Abbott for any closing remarks. Sir?", "James Abbott", "Thank you very much. Appreciate that, everyone joining the call today. We -- as it's been mentioned a couple of times in the call today, we do have an Investor Day coming up on March 1st. It is mentioned on Page 7 of the earnings release. The event is expected to begin at 8 AM Mountain Time, 10 AM Eastern Time.

And so please contact investor@zionsbancorp.com or myself directly, or via the phone numbers listed in press release.", "Thank you so much for joining us for the call today. And please -- we look forward to seeing you in March if possible or at our next earnings call, next quarter. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.
