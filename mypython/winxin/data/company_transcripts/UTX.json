(NYSE:UTX) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2017  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Greg Hayes - Chairman and CEO", "Akhil Johri - EVP and CFO", "Carroll Lane - VP, IR", "Analysts", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital", "Lucy Guo - Cowen and Company", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities", "David Strauss - UBS Securities", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Jason Gursky - Citi", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Doug Harned - Bernstein", "Steve Tusa - JP Morgan", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Fourth Quarter 2016 Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there's a presentation available for download on the UTC's website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results for continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of non-reoccurring and/or non-operational nature often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings include its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. Thank you, Brian and good morning, everyone. So 2016 a solid year for UTC we delivered on the commitments that we set back in December 2015 and today we reported adjusted EPS of $6.61 just a $0.01 above the high end of the outlook range that we provided. I think importantly sales $57.2 billion at organic growth of 2% and free cash flow to net income was 93% even with the continued investments in the Aerospace ramp. Hopefully with this course within our expectations with the range for the year and of course we continue to be disciplined with our capital deployment in 2016. We returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends on top of the $10 billion from 2015.", "Looking forward to 2017 we remain confident in our full year targets. Adjusted EPS again in the $6.30 to $6.60 range and sales of $57.5 billion to $59 billion again with organic growth rate projected to be somewhere between 2% and 4% of course it\u2019s on top of the 2% organic growth we reported in 2016.", "2016 we saw a number of significant accomplishments across all the business units. Well Pratt & Whitney and our Aerospace Systems business had impressive years in the area of innovation and they achieved some noteworthy program milestones. We feel good about the GTF accomplishments that engine is now in service powering 46 A320neo and CSeries aircraft with more than 82,000 revenue hours.", "We are also adjusting some variability issues on the GTF. We have some fixes identified and of course we\u2019re supporting our customers in the field. With that though we remained very excited about the value proposition of the engine since we\u2019re meeting or exceeding both the fuel and noise and the emission targets right out of the gate.", "Pratt was also awarded the engine contract last year for the B-21 Raider. With that, Pratt has added another program to the already impressive military portfolio including the Joint Strike Fighter and the refueling tanker. Pratt\u2019s military business was truly set up for a very bright future. Aerospace systems last year we supported 15 critical program milestones including first flights, entering the service and aircraft certification across the multitude of commercial, military and business jet platforms.", "At Otis, 2016 marked the year of market segment gain for new equipment orders globally and most impressively in China. These gains were driven by higher engineering developments investments that was up almost 30% in the year. It was also helped by better market segmentation and improved sales coverage. But we\u2019re not just investing in new products we\u2019re also investing in service transformation including new IT platforms and digital tools for our 31,000 service technicians. All of this to increase our productivity and improve the customer experience.", "As you know driving cost out of the business is part of DNA. As the example CCS expanded their margins by another 60 basis points in 2016. Over the last four years since 2012 Climate, Controls and Securities have achieved 400 basis points of margin expansion all along continue to increase R&D and spending. The investments of course drive new product introduction and last year CCS introduced over 100 new products into the market.", "Aerospace Systems another great story; last year they had about $300 million of adverse impact from declines in their high margin legacy products and they were able to offset almost all of that through product cost reductions, lower E&D and lower SG&A really solid performance by Mr. Gitlin and team. So I\u2019m pleased with the progress being made in each of the businesses and despite the continued macro uncertainties we\u2019re confident in the UTC\u2019s 2017 outlook. Our continued focus on the key priorities around innovation, execution, cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation were a major factor in achieving 2016 results and they will continue to help us meet our 2020 goals of delivering a long term sustainable growth at UTC.", "With that let me hand it over and Akhil and Carroll to take you guys through the results. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks Greg. So let\u2019s talk a little about Q4. We reported good performance in line with expectations and what we had said in December. Adjusted EPS of $1.56 was up 2% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis the earnings were $1.26 so that had $0.30 of restructuring and other significant items about $90 million from restructuring. We talked about some pension liability reduction initiatives that we had taken in October that we run out in October that came with a one-time non-cash charge of $423 million or about $0.32. We also redeemed some high coupon debt about $2.25 billion of that in November and that gave rise to $164 million or $0.13 charge also in the quarter partially offsetting that on the positive side, we had additional tax settlements within the US IRS and that gave us a benefit collectively between that and some French tax law changes of about $0.23 below the line that also we have pulled out of our adjusted EPS.", "Overall cash flow came in strong 116% for fourth quarter, 93% of net income for the full year slightly above expectation, so pleased with that performance. If you look at the organic growth on Slide 3, no major changes in the trends that we were seeing throughout the year, just some minor puts and takes here. Americas for the commercial businesses had continued with a strong growth. Otis particularly up 4% in the quarter year-over-year that was on top of 10% growth that they had in Q4, 2015 over 2014 so again strong performance. CCS was up 2% largely on both residential and commercial HVAC showing decent growth.", "Within EMEA actually the change the data decline that you see on the page it\u2019s entirely a function of Middle East. Middle East sales saw the pressure from the order reduction that we\u2019ve seen in prior quarter than were actually down 35% year-over-year for commercial HVAC and nearly 40% down year-over-year for the Otis new equipment business. Excluding that Europe was actually up low single-digit for Otis largely on the strength of new equipment business and CCS was down low single-digit. Asia was flat continued pressure from Otis. China new equipment which was down low double-digit 12% and both the CCS and Otis were both up in rest of Asia nicely.", "Now Aerospace the quarter is not really meaningful because you\u2019ll recall we had some volatility last year between third and fourth quarter as a result of the new logistic center that we had launched last year in Q3, so what is more meaningful certainly from my perspective is looking at the second half in totality and if you do that, we were up 4% to 5% for UTAS and Pratt combined in the second half which is more in line with what we expect in 2017 and going forward through our 2020 target, so in line with that so the fourth quarter numbers is not that meaningful there.", "The interesting thing and encouraging thing frankly for me was being orders we saw pockets of improvements in some of our commercial businesses. Firstly for the first time this year on a quarterly basis CCS equipment orders were up. They were up 2% in fact if you include services they were up 6% year-over-year so an encouraging sign as we go into next year. Otis China new equipment orders were also flat on a dollar basis. Now we all know one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but this is still encouraging.", "And as I said in December obviously Q1, 2017 we will see probably the lowest organic growth at CCS in terms of their full year outlook. We also expect EPS for first quarter to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 largely driven by two facts I think, if you look at our bridge for the full year that we shared with you in December. We expect $0.32 of good news from share buybacks or lower share counts. First quarter will have a smaller portion of that, so it\u2019s only $0.04 to $0.05 good news in the first quarter. Secondly for the commercial business both Otis and CCS we expect to see better year-over-year profit performance in the second half than in the first half and so that\u2019s impacting the first quarter to some extent, but overall pretty good start.", "And with that let me hand it over to Carroll to walk through the BU detail. Carroll?", "Carroll Lane", "Thanks Akhil. I\u2019m on Slide 4 and I\u2019ll be speaking to the segment at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder there\u2019s an appendix on Slide 14 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. So Otis; in the quarter sales were flat to the prior year at constant currency while profit was down 4%, foreign exchange translation was a 1 point headwind to sales and earnings. Profit in the quarter benefited from higher service volume, productivity and mark-to-market FX tailwind. These benefits were more than offset by continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA as well as additional E&D investments.", "New equipment sales were down 2% driven by low double-digit decline in China and close to 40% decline in the Middle East offsetting these headwinds we continue to see strong growth in North America with new equipment sales of 13% as well as solid growth in Europe. Europe was up 7%. Otis service sales were up 3% with continued growth in modernization and repair. Maintenance sales were up slightly. New equipment orders were up 3% in the quarter and saw a mid-teen growth in EMEA and low double-digit growth in Asia excluding China and this is partially offset by North America down about 20% of tough compares. You recall last year North America orders were up over 50% in the fourth quarter.", "New equipment orders in China were flat on a dollar basis but up 5% in units and that\u2019s despite a market estimated to be down mid-single-digit. For the full year operating profit was down about 6% in constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Organic sales excluding China were up 4%. FX translation for the year had a 2 point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit.", "Turning to Slide 5, Climate, Controls and Security sales were up 5% in constant currency in the quarter that was all due to acquisitions. Profits were up 5% driven by acquisitions and lower cost partially offset by around $15 million of impact from the devaluation of the Egyptian Pound. FX translation was a 2 point headwind to sales in earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter with strength in North America residential HVAC offset by declines in Global, Fire and Security and Middle East commercial HVAC.", "Transport refrigeration was down 1% with container down slightly and that was a sequential improvement after being down almost 30% through the third quarter. Commercial refrigeration was up 9%. Total equipment orders in CCS were up 2% for the quarter and up for the first time this year, if you all noted. Strong growth in commercial refrigeration up nearly 20% combined with high single-digit growth in fire and security products more than offset continued pressure in North America truck trailer.", "Global commercial HVAC equipment orders declined 5% and that was primarily driven by the Middle East which was down over 50%. For the full year CCS grew operating profits by $130 million at actual FX with organic sales down 1%. FX translation for the year had an unfavourable 1 point impact to sales and profit. Operating profit growth was driven by continued productivity, restructuring gains and tailwinds from commodities.", "Shifting to Aerospace on Slide 6. Pratt & Whitney\u2019s sales were flat organically in the quarter. The military business saw low single-digit growth driven by OEM, development programs and aftermarket. We also saw growth in commercial OEM driven by favorable mix and development revenues. For the year, we delivered a total of 138 GTF engines and now support 13 operators in service. In the quarter we delivered 62 GTF engines supporting customer requirements and that was in the highest output for a quarter to-date on the GTF for Pratt.", "Commercial aftermarket was down 6% in the quarter. In the large engine business the transactional aftermarket was up 3% and above tough prior year compares. However this strength was more than offset by unfavorable long-term contract adjustments for fleet management program. Pratt Canada aftermarket saw a growth in the quarter up 6%. Pratt operating profit was down $80 million driven by the unfavorable contract adjustments in the commercial aftermarket, additional ramp related costs and unfavorable mix in military engines and that did included the absence of F117. This was partially offset by tailwind from pension, FX and lower negative engine margin. For the full year organic sales were up 6% and operating profit was down $162 million. Higher negative engine margin E&D and ramp related investments were partially offset by drop through from the double-digit sales growth in the commercial aftermarket as well as tailwind from pension and FX.", "Turning to Slide 7, Aerospace Systems operating profit was up 4% in the quarter on flat organic sales. Commercial OEM sales were down 1%. Continued growth on next generation platforms was more than offset by decline in legacy volumes. Commercial aftermarket was up 3% with 4% growth in parts and repair combined and a slight decline in provisioning. As we\u2019ve seen throughout the year military sales declined in the quarter down 4% and that included the continued headwind from the completion of the C5 Nacelle retrofit program that wrapped up earlier in the year.", "Operating profit growth was driven by drop through on higher commercial aftermarket sales. Continued cost reduction and pension tailwind partially offset by unfavorable commercial OEM mix and lower military volumes. In line with expectations full year operating profit was essentially flat on 2% organic growth. Strong performance in cost reduction offset new program mix in military volume headwinds.", "And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Greg.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay, thanks Carroll. So overall 2016 no drama, at the end of the day. Lot of challenges throughout the year but good execution by the entire team as a result we were able to meet all the commitments that we laid out for the year, so that\u2019s 2016. Let\u2019s focus now on 2017 for just a second. Lot of challenges ahead of us. I think all of us recognized we\u2019ve got a new administration in Washington which has an agenda to be friendly to business and I think, we\u2019re anxious to see how all of that will play out certainly tax reform is the biggest single item that we\u2019re focused on this year.", "On top of that, however there is always the issue of FX. We recall we\u2019ve pegged the Euro at 1.05 to the $1, we\u2019re little bit better than that today. I think it\u2019s 107 but FX remains a watch item for the year especially with the impacts of tax reform potentially impacting the exchange rates. We are also of course closely watching the economic environments on both China and Europe our second and third largest markets. Also of course what happens with BREXIT and also the elections in France and Germany will create some uncertainty as we move through the year.", "Despite all of this, I\u2019m very confident we have a portfolio industry leading businesses. We\u2019ve got a global footprint, we got a global scale, we got a strong balance sheet as well as an experienced management team. All of those things give me a high confidence in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we wait out of month ago. We, of course, remain committed to the key priorities, we\u2019re going to continue to innovate for growth. We\u2019re increasing R&D investments in both Otis and CCS and we\u2019re going to continue to drive cost out through restructuring and product cost reduction.", "We also remained disciplined in our capital allocation. We recalled last year we had to place over $1 billion to $2 billion for M&A, we ended up only doing about $700 million but again trying to be disciplined with your money. This year we\u2019ve got a place over $3.5 billion for share buyback and $1 billion to $2 billion for M&A again. High confidence that we\u2019ll continue to buy back stock as we continue to see intrinsic value of UTC significantly in excess of the current share price.", "In total we remain on track to return $22 billion to shareowners from 2015 to 2017. Entire organization is focused on execution and meeting these commitments. These include commitments to both our customers, our shareowners and our employees. We\u2019ve never been better positioned for growth. We get strong backlog and these great four global franchises that all provide recurring revenues and resilient business model. UTC is uniquely positioned to deliver shareholder value well into the future.", "So with that let me stop and open it up for questions. Brian?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] our first question will come from the line Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Can you talk a little bit more about the Pratt and Whitney aftermarket? You mentioned a long-term contract impact, I'm trying to - I guess can you size it? Is it one time; is it something that is ongoing? And is there any way to read into that how you were able to get price in terms of the fourth quarter because that's usually when we would see the pull forward in terms of - that\u2019s probably more the parts side.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, Sam I think you\u2019re exactly right. The contract adjustments we typically see these on a quarterly basis at Pratt. We go through all of our - I think we got some 80 long-term contracts out there with the airlines and we look at each one of these every quarter because there\u2019s some issues that we\u2019ve seen in the V2500, we went back and we had some negative adjustments on some long-term contracts specifically related to the V program. Again I would say it\u2019s not a one-off it\u2019s just something we look at every quarter. We recall, we get good news, some quarters we get bad news, some quarters. This year I think net probably $200 million of bad news on these contract adjustments, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it. The good news of course is, we\u2019re selling more spare parts and you saw that I think first spare parts were up 3% or so in the fourth quarter and that was off of a really difficult compare for the 2015 where I think we were about 19%. So wouldn\u2019t read anything into it, I think it was just kind of one off thing at Pratt clearly something we had anticipated as we started looking at this. And the reason Pratt\u2019s got at the low end of the guidance range for the year.", "Akhil Johri", "Keeping mind Sam that for the full year, Pratt commercial aftermarket was 10% up which is exactly what I think we had said sometime middle of the year. So we\u2019ve seen some good strength on the transactional side as Greg side. Some of it was driven by some of these issues that we\u2019ve seen unfortunately the reverse side of that shows up in our FMP contracts and so the net-net is still a pretty good solid story.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.", "Carter Copeland", "Greg, I wanted to ask about the GTF and just what you guys have been seeing in terms of in-service reliability. Clearly you\u2019ve been swapping out some engines there\u2019ve been some to come off wing. I just wondered if you could speak to, how that\u2019s trending and what you guys are seeing in terms of delivery to spare engines and how that trended versus your original expectations and just sort of what the implications are for how that engine is performing given it\u2019s got such a high level of FMP\u2019s.", "Greg Hayes", "Carter, that\u2019s a good question. As we exited the year, we saw really two issues around the durability I would say with engine. We\u2019ve got 82,000 hours now in service on the engine and we\u2019re starting to see some issues out there but it\u2019s really related to two specific things and one we\u2019ve been talking about since probably the middle of last year which is the combustor liner is not having in some harsh environments like India. We\u2019re not getting the light bottom that combustor liner that we had expected so there is a redesign that\u2019s being implemented we\u2019ll get those out there in service later this year. Second issue is, oil seal or a carbon seal where we\u2019re seeing again some premature failures on that. We\u2019re working with the supplier on that to correct that, again we\u2019ve got a fix in place it should be delivered by about May I think of this year.", "So these are annoying things for the airlines, they obviously closed them some disruption. We\u2019ve got a lot of spares out there to try to keep the fleet runnier than the fact, we\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job with supporting them. It is still a pain for the airline so a little bit of noise in the system but I would characterize it as typical of a new program introduction and we exited the year on a good trajectory for production. I think we built 62 engines in the fourth quarter. This year we\u2019re going to build 350 to 400 big chunk of those, over 50 off those engines will be spares to again to support the fleet going up there to make sure when we do have these issues the customers are not impacted too much so, just normal growing pains in any new engine. But I would say nothing causing us to lose a lot of sleep.", "Akhil Johri", "And Carter just to put in perspective, you know this industry better than I do but certainly to put in perspective historically when we introduced engines in addition to some teething pains, we also struggled with fuel burn and some of the other commitments and the good news is that, this time at least those key performance characteristic are being met right out of the box and that\u2019s unusual and so that makes us feel good. The gear architecture is holding up very well and so the fundamentals of the engines are still very sound and it delivers the fuel performance. So some teething issues will get through this is always part of what happens and the good news is, we\u2019re catching these early and we will fix these as soon as we can.", "Greg Hayes", "Thank you. To Akhil\u2019s point too, Carter I would just say I think the gear system has performed flawlessly and this oil seal issue that we talk about has nothing to do with the gear system. So medium [ph] fuel burn we\u2019re doing everything, there is been no order cancelations. It really just normal new product introduction issues that everybody goes through.", "Carter Copeland", "And just as a clarification on that topic, do you build in cushion into the long-term service agreement to account for this sort of stuff?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, absolutely. We take a look at all of these contracts. You build in a warranty cushion if you will in terms of but, you\u2019re going to have to get away for the first couple of years. So we don\u2019t see any big drama on the long-term FMP\u2019s as a result of this. Again we\u2019ve got fixes identified, we get them in the fleet this year. These contracts less or run over 10 plus year, so there is not flying the hours which is the good news.", "Carter Copeland", "Great. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Lucy Guo with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.", "Lucy Guo", "This is Lucy on for Cai. Can you talk about the moving parts of the Trump administration policies in terms of any tax cuts or the border adjustments and whatever manufacturing implications maybe?", "Greg Hayes", "Sure, Lucy. Well first of all, we obviously have been following the Trump administration closely in terms of what you\u2019re talking about on tax reform and it looks like we\u2019re going to be following the Chairman Brady blueprint out of Ways of Means which would lower the top rate to somewhere around 20% eliminate the deductibility of interest but also provide for immediate expensing of capital, also provide for a territorial system which is really good news for us because as you know we\u2019ve got about $6 billion of cash sitting overseas that we can\u2019t bring back to the US, very cost effectively, so we look at this as a huge opportunity to again drive growth in the business and growth here in the US by being able to bring cash back.", "There is still some question mark around border adjustability and we are net exporter, so if that were to remain in place probably a positive for us, but again there is a lot of moving pieces in tax reform and we will be actively involved in the debate. Again the good news is, if it does happen this year it\u2019s going to be a net positive for the US economy.", "Lucy Guo", "Great and can you just say, is it net positive or favorable or not?", "Greg Hayes", "Well I would like to say it\u2019s going to be a net positive but as you know Lucy, the devil is always in the detail around taxes. Our reflective tax rate is about 28%, if they drop the rate to 20% or even 15% obviously that would be helpful. Lose the deductibility on interest which you know we\u2019ve got about $1 billion of interest expense a year so that would hurt. Again it will all be what happens in the transition rules too and how do you transition in the lower rate, how do you transition in the border adjustability. But net-net I think it\u2019s positive even if our effective tax rate doesn\u2019t drop all the way down to 20% just having access to foreign in cash to territorial system is a very, very positive net for the US economy.", "Lucy Guo", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Howard Rubel", "Greg, you\u2019ve talked a lot about innovation and focus on new products R&D is up a little bit and in 2016, where are you initiatives for 2017 and what will see the spending on other than obviously improving GTF?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, so if you think about we spent about $2.3 billion. We saw probably the biggest increase percentage wise at Otis and then I think it\u2019s just some deferred maintenance where we haven\u2019t been spending enough on new product introduction. So you\u2019ll see Otis, E&D go up a little bit again this year as we look both to introduce new products as well as to help on the service side as under the service tools. As far as the Aerospace businesses go, Pratt ought to start coming down the E&D curve here relatively soon, I think we\u2019ve got one more big, first we have got the MRJ certification I think that happens in the first quarter. We got Embraer out there. I think once those get behind us, we should start to see E&D tail off and trying to deal these reliability problems has caused a little bit of additional E&D but that\u2019s not really significant.", "I\u2019m saying that Aerospace Systems I think we ought to see that numbers start to tail off as you get some of these new program introductions behind us.", "Howard Rubel", "And then just as a follow-up on Otis. You very much called out the change in trajectory with orders and it sounds like there is a lot of organizational items that went into this. Could you elaborate a little bit on this customer touch or what is it in the organization that made for this change?", "Greg Hayes", "So a couple of things I would say, Howard. One thing is, Philippe is putting a management team we still have the typical Otis structure which is really based on branch offices and regions but we now have a President of Service Business, we also have a President globally of the new Equipment business and the idea here is to drive commonality and to drive best practices across all of the Otis organization and sometimes you should know when a decentralized organization like Otis things might not always be as easy to change as you would like. And so I think Philippe with this new organization is really encouraging the collaboration and trying to again push best practices throughout the entire organization.", "For instance we look at our business in Japan, we\u2019ve got cancelation rate of less than 2%, globally it\u2019s north of 5%. So I think we can learn in Japan. Similarly what we\u2019re doing with new products coming out of France and coming out of Spain. I think we can do some things and use some of that knowledge to help us in our businesses here in North America and South America. So a lot of things to do from the organizational standpoint but the key is focus. The new equipment market again very competitive. It\u2019s about driving cost on the service side. It\u2019s about including the customer experience.", "We talk about these 31,000 service mechanics at Otis. Those are the touch points for our customers. Those are the people that represent Otis to the customer and giving those folks the right tools is imperative. We are starting rolling out some of these digital tools in Hong Kong here in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll roll out digital tools to about half of the service technicians this year that will cover about 75% of our total service sales so, a lot of things to do, a lot of best practices and it starts at the top of having the right organization, but I think Philippe and team are on track.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, on the new equipment side Howard I think some of the more encouraging things I have seen is really thorough segmentation of the market looking specifically targeted sales force additions. So seeing markets where maybe it\u2019s a tier 3 city in China or Bangalore in India where we are underrepresented vis-\u00e0-vis some of the other sales people from other companies and adding selectively sales force in those markets to provide better coverage, so it\u2019s really a very deep down analysis with targeted investments beyond just the new products staff and other things that Greg talked about. So really happy with the projects we\u2019ve seen on the equipment side there.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Julian Mitchell", "My question was on Otis. You talked back in December about maybe a slightly narrowing or at least leveling out of the price mix headwind in 2017 for Otis. I was just wondering in China it does like as if the price and mix declines are kind of narrowing in your order book at least, maybe just give some color around that?", "Akhil Johri", "Julian I would say differently because it did narrow. If you think about it, our orders were up in units 5% and dollars were flat, right so the gap was only 5 points this time compared to a larger gap that we\u2019ve seen in the earlier quarters. On the pricing side, we did see pricing pressure go down to 6% to 7% range from the 9% range that we\u2019ve seen before and if you recall from our December conversation that is what our plan is for next year. Now obviously one quarter does not make a trend and the local team would still say it\u2019s very competitive out there in China, a lot depends on what happens with the policies on the real estate side and the housing markets in China. But certainly Q4 was a little more encouraging than what we\u2019ve seen for the first three quarters.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thanks and just a quick follow-up, did you see the same in Europe, how\u2019s the pricing in the EMEA sort of particularly aftermarket business right now.", "Akhil Johri", "Unfortunately not much of a change there, so Europe service business has seen similar level of pricing pressure that we\u2019ve seen historically. The real thing there that will change that as you know is two things. One is inflation because most of our contracts have built in price increases related to customer price inflations etc. and we\u2019ve seen virtually no sign of that, so that starts to change that will automatically ease some of the pricing pressure. The second thing that will probably change that dynamic will be greater strength in the new equipment business because that will better conversion and it will also drive a little easing of the comparative pressure on some of the people.", "So there at least we saw some signs, the new equipment orders in Europe excluding Middle East were up 13% for the year. Right. That\u2019s a pretty strong sign of new equipment project, the modernization side is also up strongly. The backlog for modernization in Europe was up over 30%, so when you look at those data points it\u2019s encouraging but really not much change in the service pressure yet. It is a long-term story it will probably take another year or two before we will see that.", "Julian Mitchell", "Understood. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.", "David Strauss", "Greg, F35 obviously the new administration have taken a lot of interest in that pushing on the cost side, given you\u2019re the engine provider can you talk about how you might be participating in that as well?", "Greg Hayes", "Just to be clear, we negotiate separately from Lockheed on the engine, we negotiate directly with the Joint Program Office, the JPO. As we\u2019ve said for number of years we remain committed to a cost curve that we establish back in 2010, which is essentially an 88% learning curve meaning that every time we double production we\u2019ll take the price or the cost down by about 12% and we remain on that 88% learning curve. I think we\u2019re just on lot - LRIP 11 negotiations right now [indiscernible] drama with us and JPO on cost as we continue to meet the commitments we have there. Obviously Lockheed has got some work to do, but I think even Mrs. Houston [ph] said yesterday they\u2019re coming down to cost to curb nicely as well, they\u2019ll have a JSF out there next a lot less than $90 million from over $100 million today. So there is cost reduction coming, volumes are picking up and it\u2019s a great aircraft. I think if you ask the Marines, they like the aircraft in service and certainly the Israelis and some of the other foreign buyers are very happy with the aircraft. So there\u2019s always going to be pressure on price what is the biggest DOD procurement program in history. But I think Lockheed is committed to continue cost reduction as Pratt & Whitney.", "David Strauss", "Okay, thanks and as a quick follow-up on the outlook call Greg I think you talked about the idea that, we could see share repurchase come down significantly in 2018 relative to 2017 more of a focus on M&A and dividend. Could you just expand a little bit on that and your thinking there? Thanks.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, so as we think about, we\u2019ll do about $3.5 billion of additional share buyback this year. Which is a little bit above the historical norm, so remember back in late 2015 we committed to this $22 billion of capital redeployment or capital returning to shareholders, we\u2019re on track to do that. As I think about when we get to 2018, 2019 we\u2019ll probably go back towards that $2 billion a year, $1 billion to $2 billion a year of share buyback. We need to do a little less than a $1 billion a year just to offset dilution so that\u2019s I would say the minimum number out there. But we\u2019ll continue to be judicious in terms of where we spend the capital. I\u2019m not looking to do big M&A, but again if you get cost or if you get tax reform this year you could actually see it a little bit different capital allocation because maybe you can take the dividend off if you know you can get access to your foreign cash. Well right now as you know about half of our cash is generated overseas and most of the cash is going out, it\u2019s for US purposes like the dividend, like debt repayment, etc. so happy to access to that foreign cash through tax returns I think it will be very beneficial to us and allow us to really look at this whole capital allocation strategy that we have.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Nigel Coe", "Greg, just turning back to the V mark that you took on the long-term contracts. I am sorry if maybe you provided more color, I was going back and forth on another call. But can you maybe just provide a bit more color on what drove those adjustments? And given that you review these contracts periodically, to what extent do you think there could be further contract adjustments over the next 12 months?", "Akhil Johri", "Nigel, as you know the way the process works is, we\u2019ve got about 80 contracts that Greg mentioned earlier and we look at them on a quarterly basis and as we have more data on cost performance or the product performance that factors into re-estimating the overall cost, it\u2019s also a function of what time period the contract is in and if it\u2019s eight years out of 10 already done, there may be a [indiscernible] catch up for which has a larger impact than normal and I think some of what you saw in this quarter was a function of that. Again no surprises here we kind of knew as we saw the transactional spares come in stronger as a result of couple of these technical issues we\u2019ve talked about. There the impact on the FMP\u2019s was going to be adverse and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve factored into our guidance and was affected as well as in Q3, so I think periodically as we do these things, we catch up. But I think it\u2019s behind us I don\u2019t expect that.", "Greg Hayes", "I think the issue that\u2019s caused the re-estimation bad news a specific durability issue that we saw on V related to a part that supplied from one of our partners. We\u2019re in the process of campaigning the fleet because we had to the campaign the fleet, it\u2019s been a little bit more expensive when we do the overhauls in the shops, but to Akhil\u2019s point that means we are also selling a lot more spare parts and to those non-FMP customers. This is not a flight safety issue, this is just kind of one of those things that you encounter with an engine that been out there for a while, not a big surprise we knew this was coming but there shouldn\u2019t be, to Akhil\u2019s point more bad news related to this issue. I think we\u2019ve gone through all the contracts and done all the catch up that we need to do.", "Nigel Coe", "Great, thanks that\u2019s great color. And then just switching back to Otis pricing. Obviously good news directionally on that. Do you think that the pricing umbrella in China is getting, do you think that\u2019s reflective of just the broad pricing in China or is this, do you think this is Otis specific and any color on market share trends would be helpful too?", "Akhil Johri", "Clearly on the market share that\u2019s an easy question to answer right now because we\u2019ve seen 4% to 5% growth in our unit orders and we know that the market is declined by about 5%, so I think that clear demonstration of a share gain and this is just China I\u2019m talking about. I think if you do the similar analysis in most parts of the world, you will see the Otis new equipment business in orders has done really well and gain share for being on a global basis, this year that\u2019s really encouraging. On the pricing side, Nigel I think while pricing pressure has always been in China it used to be in the 3% to 5% range. It escalated a little bit to the 8%, 9% type of level early in 2016 and that was partly a function of the fact that the market declined in unit terms for the first time in many years and therefore people were responding to it through price reduction. I think that is not something that can sustain forever, so we\u2019re seeing a little reduction on that. But on the other hand, you also see commodity prices going up so I think that may have some impact on pricing as well. we\u2019ll see how it all plays out, but as you know our guidance is for 5% to 6% decline in pricing next year for Otis new equipment business and similarly on the CCS business we expect slight decline in pricing there, low single-digit which are both better than we have experienced in 2016.", "Nigel Coe", "That\u2019s great color. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.", "Jason Gursky", "Sorry, if this is already been covered. Actually been having a bout between a couple of different calls. But on Geared Turbofan I think you said 64 units delivered in the quarter, you confirm that and then just talk about the ramp as we move into 2017 and 2018, some updated thoughts on that.", "Akhil Johri", "Sure. 62 Jason to just correct that data point, 62 units in fourth quarter. And the good news is that the run rate in December was exactly lined with what we need in the first quarter and January so far has been trending okay as well and this is largely on the translate side, which is what we\u2019ve talked about a lot. There is key data points that we track, that Greg looks at almost on a weekly basis. If the yield and the throughput from the fan blade facility and that\u2019s trended up, so we\u2019re at about 80% yield on the fan blade facility and a throughput down to 45 days. Both those are significant improvement from where we were in June of last year, so feel a lot better about our plans there. As you know IHI our partner had certified their facility in fourth quarter and now are going to start producing parts fan blade in first quarter this year, plus we\u2019re making excellent progress on the second facility in Michigan which will add capacity in the second quarter of this year.", "So given all those actions, we feel a lot better about the fan blade situation and overall industrial plan for Pratt, GTF production capabilities and feel very good about being able to deliver the 350 to 400 that is our goal for this year.", "Greg Hayes", "Just to add some color there, Jason we reviewed this in detail yesterday with the Pratt team. There\u2019s about 1,200 engineered components out of GTF and Pratt is engineering responsibility for about 1,000 of those. Off that 1,000 in Pratt has responsibility for there is literally six parts where we have some concern about availability to MRP and there is a plan for each one of those parts as well as the other 1,000 parts that are out there. So this, there will always be challenges as we\u2019re ramping up new engines. There\u2019s always learning that you\u2019re going to see out there. But I feel very good about what the Pratt team has put in place in terms of leadership and in terms of the analytics around understanding what\u2019s going on the supply and understanding where the shortages might and working aggressively to address those things.", "Jason Gursky", "Okay, great. One last clarification question here. You suggested second half profit in the commercial business and I couldn't hear whether you said CCS or in Otis, second-half profitability is better than the first half. Can you confirm which business it was? And then what are the major drivers of that ramp and kind of what are the risks there?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure. So in the case of CCS, Jason it\u2019s just a function of the organic growth because as you saw the order rates in Q4 came up but we still expect the trend would be relatively low organic growth in first quarter for CCS and then that order rate will continue to drive better organic growth in the second half. So it\u2019s more a function of superior organic growth later in the year driving better profitability at CCS. In the case of Otis, as you know we are still in the process of making strategic investment as Greg described a little bit about, so there will be more cost upfront before we start to see the returns on that. The second point is pricing pressure in China is more intense in the first half because of what we saw in the order book in the third and second quarter this year which gets translated into sales in the first half. So I think Otis similarly will see better profit in the second half on a year-over-year basis than in the first half.", "Jason Gursky", "That\u2019s great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Ron Epstein", "Maybe a little more detailed question on the GTF. Just kind of surveying around some of the folks looking at it closer. It seems like you guys are on the fifth generation of combustor for the engine. Does that fall in the realm of normal for a new engine, five combustors? It seems like a lot to me. I don't know. Any thoughts?", "Greg Hayes", "So I think your math is little off to - let me, so the first 17 engines went out what we would say was the first combustor, we knew that had to be upgraded and in fact, so the B combustor is the current configuration that\u2019s out there in the fleet field. As I talked about some of the durability issues that we\u2019re having the combustors, the B version of combustor is not having the life that we would hold it to have in these very harsh environment so like India and so we\u2019ve actually got one more combustor redesign on the way, we\u2019ll have that in place later this year. So I\u2019m not sure where you got five, but we\u2019re clearly working on the third version which we think will give us the expected life that we had committed to airlines and again it\u2019s one of those things where you don\u2019t know until you get out there in the service and not all operators are having issues with the combustors, but the ones that are it certainly painful and so we\u2019re working aggressively with spares to make sure that they\u2019ve got the right level spares out there to be able to deal with this lower than expected life on the engine.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay, cool. And maybe one more follow-on kind of along the same lines. One management team ago the goal was set forth that maybe one day you guys would be able to sell engines at breakeven OE. And given that the GTF compared to its closest competitor has what, 30% fewer parts, right? So there is less and it. Is that still a goal that one day you could sell these things at breakeven as opposed to losing money every time you ship one?", "Greg Hayes", "You know I had a dream just like Akhil had a dream that one day we would be able to sell these and breakeven but the fact to the matter is, just with the market dynamics out there and a very competitive marketplace pricing just does not allow us or the market doesn\u2019t allow us to sell these new engines at anything other than a loss. The good news is, I think longer term value is still there, the IRR and the GTF program still north, well north of our cost to capital and we continue to see opportunities to improve that. So this is a game not for the faint of heart, Ron you know that and these are long-term programs, returns come in the later years. The good news is, most of the investment is behind us, we\u2019re going to continue invest in negative engine margin for the foreseeable future. But three, four years from now we start seeing the first overalls on these engines is going to be very profitable with Pratt & Whitney. So again we all dreamed about breaking even and getting real value upfront, but unfortunately the market did not allow us to do that.", "Akhil Johri", "The other thing, Ron. I think is we\u2019re being very disciplined and selective with regard to the campaigns as well. I think if you look at and some of that shows up in our market share, we\u2019re not chasing market share here, but we\u2019re chasing more profitable part of the engine portfolio and trying to make sure that we are being disciplined and at least tilt that windmill a little bit. So that\u2019s part of what we need to do.", "Ron Epstein", "Got you, got you. And then maybe one last one. A while back there was some talk about maybe doing a big sister to the GTF, right, a higher thrust engine. If an aircraft OE were to do a middle of the market airplane, and there is some speculation that one based in Seattle may. Would you guys want to do an engine for that? I mean, what\u2019s your thought on doing a wide body version of the GTF?", "Greg Hayes", "Would we want to do an engine, of course we would want to do an engine, Ron. I think the question always goes back to the business case and you have to make sure that the economics for a single point aircraft and that goes to how big is the market, that goes to what pricing looks like, that goes to as well, whether or not it\u2019s going to be one or two engines offered on the aircraft. So all of those things will go into our decisions were obviously working with that company in Seattle on trade studies on the engine, just like they\u2019re not committing to, I\u2019ll say we\u2019re not going to commit to it and we\u2019ll see what happens with the economics. As you know in the airline business it\u2019s all about cost, cost and cost and we\u2019re trying to make sure that whatever product that we have out there can meet the very stringent guidelines around cost, while also delivering on the fuel burn and other key parameters for this new engine, so we\u2019ll see.", "Ron Epstein", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed.", "Doug Harned", "On Otis in China, if I go back a while ago, you used to talk about margins, OE margins in China as running kind of at the same level as Otis overall back in those days it was kind of a 20% type level. But recently, since we have seen these price declines and they may be slowing some but if we are down 6% now, we were down 9% before. When you think about Otis margins in China, where are they headed now for OE? I mean are we looking at something that has a lot more pressure on it than we have seen in the past? Or have you been able to get cost down in a commensurate way?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, so I think the answer is yes and yes. The team in China has been very good at getting cost out of the supply base that\u2019s step number one and then they have also been consolidating the operations within China to make sure that we have a common supply chain, we have a common management team, managing the supply chain, factories have been shut down and consolidated. So I think the team\u2019s very active at ensuring that we can offset and thus far they have been successful although you\u2019re right that there is increasing pressure, pricing pressure is greater, commodity prices are starting to become more of a problem now but we still remain committed to trying to keep the margin that are pretty good level on the OE side in China.", "Doug Harned", "And then on the service side, I mean a big part of this is trying to get the attachment rates up. And you saw the regulatory reform, it has been about two years now in terms of meeting service contracts for elevators that have been installed. What does the attachment rate look like now and how are you seeing the trends both in your service volume as well as service margins?", "Greg Hayes", "As we look at the attachment rates, they\u2019re still around 35-ish percent.", "Akhil Johri", "Improved slightly.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, which improved slightly over the last couple of years. The problem in China on service from a profitability standpoint is still lack of density in many of the routes. It\u2019s fine in the tier 1 cities, but we\u2019re still struggling on the profitability side. So service margins are pretty close to what you see on the new equipment side, you don\u2019t see the big differentiation that should change overtime, but part of this too regulation in China which requires two service mechanics when we visit an elevator as oppose to one, so that\u2019s driving cost up. We expect I think service this year will probably grow another 10% in China, feel very comfortable with that. The key for us that was actually getting the service technicians, we need to hire over 1,000 people again this coming year to meet the demand for these higher levels of service.", "So again it\u2019s a very long-term gain for service in China. Service didn\u2019t start, the market is still new relatively speaking. So we\u2019ll get there eventually, but it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work and more investment I would say on the Otis side, but that is ultimate price as the service portfolio. There\u2019s over 2.5 million elevators in service in China today. There is lot of opportunity there.", "Akhil Johri", "The conversion rates Doug within the Otis business in China as you know and we talked about this before, the higher end the conversion rates are even closer to the western markets which you would expect because they are people, the customers are more reliant on and they\u2019re more careful about making sure they have the right people doing the maintenance work. But on the lower end, it is significant the regulation hasn\u2019t quite kicked in yet.", "Doug Harned", "But is there a point where we should expect this to really take off? In other words, do you have goals for volume, market share those sorts of things that would give you the kind of density you want at a certain point in time? I am trying to understand when we can see this as an important contributor, if it is 10 years away or if it is three years away.", "Greg Hayes", "It\u2019s probably five year away, Doug. I think about we got about 165,000 under current maintenance contracts, maybe 175,000 through December. We\u2019ve got another probably 50,000 out there under current this like one year service warranty that we give. So I think once you get north of 250,000 to 300,000 elevators again to big country, you need density, once you get to that level, I mean we should start to see profitability increase. Again this is, it\u2019s still new business and there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to get the workforce trained and to get the efficiency and the service technicians up to the efficiency levels that we see in the rest of the world.", "Doug Harned", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steve Tusa - JP Morgan. Please proceed.", "Steve Tusa", "On the GTF, just to make sure that we are kind of reading the comments right. You are still saying that the 2018 peak loss is intact and there is not risk that there is extra cost on top of that just to make that clear, right?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes. No change to the outlook of a $1 billion of negative engine margin in 2018.", "Steve Tusa", "Right, okay. And then on CC&S [ph] for the year I think it is kind of like a mid-single-digit type of increase in profit you said it is going to start a little slow. Will it still grow here in kind of both quarters here in the first half? Just trying to judge the magnitude of the ramp expected in the second half of the year.", "Akhil Johri", "I would say, I think the CCS team would be very disappointed if they don\u2019t go there. So use to delivering profit growth every quarter that they would be disappointed if they don\u2019t grow. Now the magnitude of that is, can be questioned and that\u2019s what I was referring to more than their ability to grow earnings there, a very determined team and they know that - shareholder value that\u2019s created by growing on.", "Steve Tusa", "Okay. And that's for the first half, right? Growing profits?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, but at very low rate, probably compared to the second half.", "Steve Tusa", "Okay. And any change on the price cost dynamics there given a bit of a move up and kind of a bit of a backup recently in commodities?", "Akhil Johri", "Certainly CCS will not see the kind of commodity tailwind they saw in 2016 and that pressure has been there a little bit. The pricing side still has to play out, as you know the biggest pricing plays out in the residential market and for that the list prices are up, I think all competitors have done that. We\u2019ll have to just see how it plays out as the market goes into the cooling season.", "Steve Tusa", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Akhil Johri", "Thank you, Steve.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. This is all the time we have for questions today. So now it is my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for closing comments and remarks. Sir.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay, thanks Brian. Thank you all for listening in. I would just remind everybody 2017 has lot of challenges out there, but we remain highly confident in the guidance that we\u2019ve got. And again for us it\u2019s about execution this year, execution, execution and we\u2019re confident we got the right team to do that. So Carroll and his team will be around through the rest of the day [indiscernible] answer any questions you guys might have. Thank you guys all for listening and have a great day.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com. Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted.

", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue, and we will answer as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory Hayes", "Okay, thanks Kevin, and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release today, UTC reported second quarter earnings per share of $1.84. That\u2019s up 12% excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. Adjusted segment operating margins expanded by 90 basis points to 17.1% in the quarter. That concludes a solid first half with 4% organic sales growth and earnings per share up 11%, excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. All that gives us confidence to increase the bottom end of our EPS range, so we now expect 2014 earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.85 \u2013 that\u2019s growth of 9 to 10% versus our previous guidance of $6.65 to $6.85.", "Okay, turning to Slide 2, organic sales \u2013 organic sales grew 3% in the quarter, led by strong growth at aerospace systems and Otis. In the commercial businesses, we saw 3% growth in the Americas led by 15% growth in Otis. In Europe where the economic recovery remains tepid, organic sales were down 1% in the quarter; however, Asia saw 5% growth. In China specifically, commercial sales grew by 10% led by Otis, which was up 15%. ", "Looking at aerospace, continued weakness in defense where sales were down 4% was more than offset by strong growth in commercial OE and the aftermarket, where overall sales increased 7%. ", "Moving to Slide 3, order trends \u2013 overall trends remain positive for a majority of our portfolio; and just a reminder, we\u2019ll talk to the commercial businesses on a constant currency basis, as we usually do. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see traction in North America. U.S. consumer confidence hit a six-year high in June, and the outlook for commercial construction remains encouraging. ABI trends are positive and we continue to see that coming through in our orders at Otis, where North American new equipment orders were up 44%. Commercial HVAC orders were up 3% in the quarter. North American residential HVAC orders were down slightly versus last year, and you\u2019ll recall we had a very strong first quarter as distributors ordered ahead of the summer cooling season; but residential orders year-to-date are essentially in line with our expectations for the year. ", "In Europe, as I said before, the economic recovery remains slow. Euro zone PMI and economic sentiment eased some in June on concerns over rising oil prices and the situations in the Middle East and Ukraine, but both indicators remain in positive territory and growth is expected to pick up in the second half. We saw that reflected in UTC\u2019s order rates in the region. Otis\u2019 new equipment orders were up 10% led by strong growth in eastern Europe, where orders were up more than 20%, while in developed Europe orders grew at a 4% rate. CCS fire and security product orders grew 18% and commercial refrigeration orders were up 5%, and commercial HVAC grew at 2%.", "In China, as you know, the government has recently stepped up spending on infrastructure projects and eased banks\u2019 reserve requirements to shore up growth. In the second quarter, orders for CCS commercial HVAC were up 7% and fire products were up 10%. Otis new equipment orders were flat on a tough compare from last year. You\u2019ll recall that last year, Otis saw orders up 39% in China in the second quarter partly due to a large order for the Goldin Finance 117 Tower in Tianjin. China new equipment backlog is up 20% versus the prior year, and on a unit basis new equipment orders were up 12% in the quarter, so our building and industrial systems businesses continue to be well positioned as we head into the back half of the year.", "Moving to aerospace, with airline profits projected to be almost $18 billion this year and ongoing growth in air traffic, we continue to see solid conversion of new equipment backlogs and growth in our commercial aftermarket businesses. At Pratt & Whitney, commercial spares orders were down 6% due in part to a strong first quarter. Total large commercial engine aftermarket sales were up 10% in the quarter on the back of a continued trend of heavy overhauls going through our shops, and this continues to support our expectations for full-year aftermarket growth of about 5%.", "At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial spares orders were up 28% driven primarily by strength in provisioning. While some uncertainty still exists in the global economic outlook, order rates and macroeconomic trends continue to support our assumptions for organic growth of about 4% for the full year. ", "On Slide 4, taking a closer look at the second quarter, total reported sales increased 7% as 3% organic growth and the $830 million cumulative sales adjustment for the Canadian Maritime program were partially offset by net headwinds from net divestitures. Segment operating profit grew 8% and operating margins increased by 90 basis points, including the benefit from pension. CCS saw the benefit of restructuring and product cost reduction initiatives where operating profit grew 9%, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points. Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems expanded margins by 150 and 70 basis points respectively, each on the benefits from cost reduction actions and lower pension expense.", "Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.84 \u2013 that\u2019s up 8%. Restructuring costs and other one-time items, which include the CMHP charge in the quarter, were fully offset by favorable tax-related items. You\u2019ll recall the second quarter of 2013 had $0.05 of net gains. Absent the impact of the prior year net gains, earnings per share were up 12%.", "Free cash flow in the quarter was 80% of net income. Capital expenditures were $406 million \u2013 that\u2019s up 10% versus last year as we continue to invest for the ramp-up in commercial aero, and working capital grew by more than $400 million in the quarter. We acquired $335 million of our stock under our share repurchase programs, and we expect to buy back a similar amount in the third quarter. ", "Let me stop there for now. I\u2019ll be back to talk more about full-year, but first let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the business unit results.", "Jay Malave", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 5, Otis sales improved 7% in the quarter with new equipment sales up mid teens, including solid growth from all areas, most notably in China, the Americas, and the Middle East. Service sales were up slightly. Operating profit was up 3% constant currency. Strong new equipment volume, most notably in Asia and the Americas, drove the increase in operating profit moderated by continued pricing pressure. New equipment orders were up 3% with double-digit growth in the Americas and Europe. As Greg mentioned earlier, orders in China were flat for the quarter against a tough compare to last year, which included the Goldin Finance 117 in Tianjin project. While new equipment activity in China is normalizing to levels in line with our expectations for the year, we were encouraged in the quarter with solid growth in new equipment unit bookings. Based on year-to-date trends, we now expect operating profit for the full year to increase $100 million to $125 million from a prior expectation of $100 million to $150 million on mid-single digit sales growth. Otis expects to see improving performance in the second half from strong new equipment sales growth and continued improvement in factory performance in North America. ", "On Slide 6, Climate Controls and Security increased profit 9% in the quarter on 3% lower sales, resulting in margin expansion of 210 basis points to 19%. Organic sales were down 1% with mixed results across regions. Organic sales in Asia were down low single digits, including slower backlog conversions in the commercial HVAC business, Transicold was flattish, and Europe was up slightly. U.S. residential HVAC was flat for the quarter following a solid first quarter which included the benefit of early distributor stocking. For the first half, the residential HVAC business reported high single digit sales growth, in line with the full-year expectation.", "Profit growth in the quarter was driven by restructuring and integration savings, lower commodity costs, as well as continuing product cost reduction effort. Equipment orders were up 2% with global commercial HVAC equipment up low single digits, led by China. Orders for global fire and security products were up mid-single digits, more than offsetting the decline in the fire and security field businesses. Transicold equipment orders were up mid-single digits. Based on first half results, we continue to expect profit growth of $225 million to $250 million for the full year at CCS, now on low single-digit organic sales growth from our previous expectation of mid-single digit. ", "Turning to aerospace on Slide 7, at Pratt & Whitney operating profit was up 11% on 1% lower sales, resulting in margin expansion of 150 basis points. Organic sales were up 1% as 10% growth in large commercial aftermarket more than offset declines in commercial OE and military. The operating profit growth was mainly driven by lower pension costs and restructuring savings, and the absence of last year\u2019s contract closeout benefit was partially offset by a gain on the sale of product line this quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney\u2019s operating profit to be up $175 million to $200 million on low single-digit sales growth.", "UTC Aerospace Systems delivered another solid quarter with 14% operating profit growth on 9% higher sales. Sales growth was driven by higher commercial OE and aftermarket volume up a combined 16%, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in military sales. Year-on-year profit growth was driven by higher commercial aftermarket volume, the favorable impact from a customer contract settlement, continued synergy traction and pension tailwind partially offset by higher engineering spend on new OE programs. Operating margins increased 70 basis points to 16.7%. ", "Orders for commercial spares grew 28% on a year-over-year basis led by strength in provisioning. Commercial spares in the first half of the year are up 18% on a year-over-year basis with year-to-date book-to-build just north of 1.0. For the year, we continue to expect profit growth of $300 million to $350 million on mid to high-single digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.", "Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 9, operating profit decreased by 10% on 1% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 63 aircraft, including 46 based on military platforms and 17 commercial. The sales decrease was driven by lower U.S. government, OE and aftermarket volumes partially offset by higher international military and commercial OE sales. On profit, the headwinds from net unfavorable contract performance adjustments primarily in the military business more than offset benefits from restructuring, pension, and other cost reduction actions. ", "During the second quarter, Sikorsky was awarded two significant contracts for the development of the VXX Marine 1 replacement aircraft for the U.S. Navy and a combat search-and-rescue helicopter for the U.S. Air Force. These contracts in total exceed $2.5 billion with follow-on production orders expected to exceed $10 billion. Based on the CMHP contract amendments and other contract performance adjustments as well as aftermarket trends through the first half, we now expect higher year-over-year operating profit of about $25 million on low single-digit sales growth from a prior expectation of flattish profit on high single-digit sales growth.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.", "Gregory Hayes", "Okay, thanks Jay. So overall, another solid quarter for UTC and we continue to achieve important program milestones and secure key wins for the future. Some highlights in the quarter: we announced several significant wins at the Farnborough Air Show last week. At Pratt & Whitney, we continue to see strong demand for the GTF engine across platforms, including recent wins on the A320 Neo, C-series, Embraer E2, and MRJ. Customers clearly see the advantage of the GTF product and have placed firm and option orders for 6,000 engines. In May, Pratt delivered the first chipset of geared turbofan engines to Airbus and is ready to support the first flight of the Neo later this year.", "As you\u2019ve no doubt heard, we\u2019ve had a couple of engine-related development issues in the quarter. While certainly disappointing, these things do happen in development programs, which is why we put the engines through such a rigorous test process. The good news is that the issues are unrelated and in the big picture, the fixes will be relatively minor. We\u2019re pleased that the Pentagon has approved the JSF for resumed flying on a limited basis. The F135 engine has accumulated more than 26,000 ground and flight test hours, but we continue to learn and develop the technology to provide our customers with the capability and reliability they require. On the C-series, we understand the root cause of the incident and we\u2019re working closely with Bombardier to resume flight testing as soon as possible. The fundamental architecture of the geared turbofan engine remains sound, and with nearly 10,000 hours of ground and flight testing it\u2019s the most mature of the new generation of advanced commercial engines entering the market. With significant testing behind us, we look forward to bringing the GTF engine family into service in 2015.", "Also in the quarter on the Aerospace Systems segment, we were selected to provide wheels and carbon brakes for both the Boeing 737 Max and the Airbus A320 Neo platform. They also secured new long-term MRO contracts from several airlines and they celebrated the delivery of the 10,000th Boeing 737 nacelle. ", "At Sikorsky, they were selected on two key U.S. DoD programs in the quarter. It was awarded the engineering and manufacturing development contracts to build the next generation Marine 1 Presidential helicopter and to develop new combat search-and-rescue helicopters for the U.S. Air Force. Combined, these two programs represent over $12 billion of future sales opportunity. On the commercial side, the Civilian Aviation Administration of China recently issued a type certificate for the S76B, which allows Sikorsky to begin delivering the helicopter to customers in China. We\u2019re also pleased that Sikorsky and the Canadian government concluded contract amendments in the second quarter which define a final configuration for the CMH aircraft and a phased delivery schedule allowing for the retirement of Canadian Sea King helicopters beginning next year.", "We recorded sales of $830 million and a charge of $438 million in the quarter, reflecting the cumulative effect of progress to date towards completion of the modified program. This puts the CMHP OE losses largely behind us. Under percentage of completion accounting, we will have some small charges as we progress on the program, but they are manageable within the Sikorsky numbers going forward.", "The building and industrial systems businesses had a solid second quarter with a combined 7% profit growth. Integration activities continue to progress well with Otis and CCS teams finding a way to serve our customers more efficiently. A recent example of this was in Hong Kong where UTC Building and Industrial Systems was selected to provide building systems for the i-Square shopping and entertainment complex. This project will include intelligent building management systems, chiller plant optimization, and remote monitoring. i-Square is also equipped with Otis escalators.", "So each of the businesses is well positioned in our core markets and we\u2019re delivering real value to our customers and securing key orders that will drive top line growth well into the future. ", "Taking a look at the rest of the year, not much really changed from the last time we spoke. As you know, the compares get tougher as we move through the year, but first half order rates and end market trends continue to be broadly in line with our expectations, and we\u2019re confident in the revised guidance range of $6.75 to $6.85 with a path towards the higher end on sales of about $65 billion, up from our prior expectation of about $64 billion primarily on the Q2 CMHP sales adjustment. We now expect quarterly earnings per share growth of about 7% to 10% in the last two quarters of the year, absent the impact of gains and restructuring.", "On restructuring, we\u2019re investing about $375 million for the year and we spent $180 million in the first half, so you can expect to see about $100 million of restructuring spend in each of the next two quarters. As we committed, we expect the restructuring and one-time charges, including the second quarter CMHP charge, will be offset by gains during the course of the year. We also continue to anticipate pay down of about a billion dollars this year, and we now expect share repurchase of $1.25 billion for the year \u2013 that\u2019s an increase of $250 million from our prior expectations. On the M&A side, we expect spend will now be a little bit less than a billion dollars.", "As you know, at UTC we typically deliver free cash flow greater than or equal to net income. Through the first half, free cash flow is 81% of net income and cash flow is generally stronger in the second half; but as I sit here today, I think 90% to 100% for 2014 is more realistic based on the continued investments we\u2019re making on the aerospace side to deal with the aerospace cycle. Looking forward, we remain focused on growth and execution in 2014. We\u2019re well positioned in our segments and will continue to capitalize on our industry-leading franchises and global scale. The UTC portfolio is poised to take advantage of the commercial aerospace growth and urbanization megatrends over the next decade.", "So with that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Kevin?", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]", "Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "Morning everyone. Greg, I was wondering if you could address a little bit cash flow into next year, at least at a high level. Obviously the working capital burden may remain heavy, but you still feel that you\u2019re at kind of a peak level for capex, and how might those items trend in the next year?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yeah, I think as we\u2019ve said before, Jeff, I think capex definitely peaks this year just shy of $2 billion \u2013 that\u2019s up from about $1.7 billion last year, and then next year we\u2019ll see that come down $200 million, $300 million again as the ramp, or the facilitization for the ramp is pretty much complete by next year. Again, we\u2019re going to start delivering these engines at the end of next year and we have to be ready, so the money is going out now. It\u2019s part of the working capital build as well. We\u2019ll continue to target 100% of free cash flow to net income both this year and next year. I think we\u2019re just acknowledging now that it\u2019s going to be really difficult to do it this year, just given the big capex ramp and the working capital ramp associated with the GTF launch. ", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on U.S. commercial HVAC trends, both around the applied and unitary markets.", "Jay Malave", "Jeff, total commercial HVAC orders were up low single digits. The applied was actually up higher, mid to high single digits, and the light commercial was up a little bit, low single digits.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "Those are order numbers, or--?", "Jay Malave", "Those are orders.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "And do you have sales?", "Jay Malave", "Sales \u2013 I do not have sales in front of me. I\u2019ll have to get back to you on that, Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "Great, thanks. I\u2019ll pass the floor.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JP Morgan.", "Joe Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks, good morning. On the UTAS spare side, obviously some pretty good numbers, and I know it\u2019s provisioning but does that give you more confidence in your profit guidance for the year for UTAS, or how is all that flowing through?", "Gregory Hayes", "There\u2019s a lot of elements to the profit growth at the Aerospace Systems group in the back of the year. There\u2019s a big chunk of synergies coming through. Obviously the aftermarket is supportive of the guidance. Clearly it\u2019s a big number for UTAS, and back half is going to be big; but generally, I think we\u2019ve guided to about high single digits, I think Jay, for Aerospace Systems aftermarket growth. This is obviously a little bit better than that, so yeah, I think it all just goes through the back half of the year and everything should be pretty much in line.", "Joe Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, and then over at CCS, you brought the mid-single digits down to low single digits for expected organic growth. Can you give some color on not in the quarter but just in terms of the guidance for the year which end markets that\u2019s lower in?", "Gregory Hayes", "So first half of the year, organic growth at CCS was about 1%. Back half of the year, we\u2019re expecting about 4%, so we\u2019ve got a little bit of a hill here in the back half of the year. Again, still confident we\u2019re going to hit that guidance number out there \u2013 225 to 250 \u2013 even on the lower sales expectations.", "I think generally things are in line with what we expected. Resi was a little soft in the second quarter, but that really just relates to the big pre-buy we saw in Q1, so I think it\u2019s about up 9% year-to-date. We expect it to be up kind of high single digits in that range in the back half of the year as well. Order rates on the commercial HVAC has improved. Order rates at Transicold have pretty much stabilized; so again, I think all the pieces are in place to get to that 4% growth, and obviously there\u2019s cost reduction initiatives and other things that give us confidence to hit that number. But generally speaking, I think (indiscernible) we\u2019re pretty well on track to deliver that back half growth.", "Joe Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. If I look at the Pratt EBIT guidance for the year, I think it implies growth of about $120 million in the second half. You did about plus-70 in the first half, and I guess if you look at what\u2019s gone on in Q2, you\u2019ve had weaker commercial spares orders but also you mentioned maybe there might be some extra E&D needed for the engine fixes. So what gives you the confidence that you\u2019ll see a big step up in year-on-year EBIT growth in Pratt in the second half?", "Jay Malave", "Well Julian, what we have\u2014for the year for Pratt, a substantial part of their profit growth is restructuring savings, which is pretty much baked \u2013 a lot of that was taken last year \u2013 as well pension benefit. Again, that\u2019s pretty much going to be reflected in their results. Aftermarket, as Greg said, is up 10% year-to-date. That will moderate a little bit in the back half.", "The other piece of it is that we\u2019ll actually get a little bit better performance out of the military business, a little bit lighter on shipments on the military engines, particularly in the JSF. We\u2019ll see that ramp up in the second half of the year, and we\u2019ll also get a little bit of lift out of Pratt & Whitney Canada, who is off to a pretty reasonable start year-to-date. So those two businesses will help offset some moderation, I\u2019d say, in the large commercial aftermarket.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I\u2019d also just point out we\u2019re in the process of definitizing the lot for LRIP 7 with the JSF, so there were a number of engines that could have or should have gone out the door here in the second quarter. There is more than 12 of them that will go out here in the third quarter, so you\u2019re going to see a bump in military OE coming into the third quarter, which is going to help as well.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. My follow-up is in BIS, your China sales in the first half were up about 12%, I think in total. What do you expect that second half revenue growth number to be?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think on Otis, what we\u2019ve guided to is mid-teens \u2013 about 15%, which is exactly what we saw here in the second quarter. The CCS side, a little bit lighter than that, just a little less than 10% in the back half. And again, order rates as we look at the GST business and the other businesses, commercial HVAC, are all supportive of that back half.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.", "Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Morning. On Otis, what was it that lowered your guidance outlook for profit for the year? Has the outlook changed at all in terms of pricing or demand?", "Gregory Hayes", "It was small tweak \u2013 I think we took down the top end by about 25 million. We\u2019ve grown earnings just under $30 million in the first half of the year. We saw a nice return to profitability, profitability growth in the second quarter, but it\u2019s just the realization that we\u2019re probably not going to get to the top end of the range. We continue to make investments in new products \u2013 I think we saw that when we were in China a couple of weeks ago. But you know, we\u2019re going to get that factory transformation. It\u2019s pretty well complete, you\u2019re going to get some tailwind from that. It\u2019s probably not going to get to the top end \u2013 in Europe, pricing is still a little choppy, and it\u2019s just the realization that we\u2019re more likely towards the middle of that range.", "Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Then on UTAS, when you look at how the 787 program is going, can you comment on progress there? And as you look forward, presumably the program will become a bigger contributor to UTAS margins. How should we think about the trajectory for the 787 in terms of profitability?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well clearly, 787, we\u2019re still in a negative margin situation across all of 787. I think we talked last year, we mentioned we were losing about $3 million a ship set. That number is coming down significantly. Within, I think, 2015 or 2016, we\u2019ll be close to a breakeven point on 787, so we are coming down the learning curve as we expected. Still a lot of work to do. Reliability is improving on the aircraft systems that are out there. We\u2019re close to our contractual goals that we\u2019ve got with the Boeing company, continuing to work with Boeing on product improvement opportunities. So the program is going well, and there\u2019s really no surprises there. ", "Jay Malave", "", "Yes, also Doug, we\u2019ve got the Dash 9 coming on line here, too; and don\u2019t forget, part of the growth and provisioning this quarter was on the back of 787, so you\u2019re seeing nice profitability and provisioning, which helps offset at least a portion of the negative margin associated with the OE.", "Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And is the Dash 9 leading to some significant change activity for you in this that sort of pushes the trajectory back a little?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, it was a few of the systems that are different on the Dash 9 \u2013 the environmental controls, the ECS system was upgraded, but most of the other systems are the same so it\u2019s actually helping in terms of the learning curve on the product.", "Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.", "Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Yes, good morning, Greg. First, a clarification \u2013 on the GTF engine fix, I assume that\u2019s applying out to all the models. Is that going to affect the certification timeline?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, in fact really this particular fix we think is just related to the C-series engine itself. Each of the architecture is a little bit different, and we have not seen a similar issue on any of the other models that are out there.", "Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay, and then just a quick one on Pratt & Whitney Canada, are you seeing any ready change regarding the lower end of the business jet market? Just\u2014I think that\u2019s 40% of your mix up there.", "Gregory Hayes", "No, it\u2019s\u2014I guess the best way to describe it is it\u2019s still a little choppy. Deliveries are picking up a little bit, but there\u2019s still a lot of used inventory out there. Orders have really not picked up. I think the best news there is flying hours have picked up a little bit, and as you know, most of that business is on power by the hour so we\u2019re still seeing a decent cash inflow, but really not seeing a bit step change in terms of the growth of the market.", "Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning. Greg, I was wondering if you could kick off on China, on the orders trends you\u2019ve seen there. Have you seen any shift in market share in your various products?", "Gregory Hayes", "Nothing dramatic, I would say. I think again, Otis has regained its\u2014or is regaining, I guess I should say, the share that we had lost in previous years, which is really a trend that started last year, it\u2019s continuing into this year, getting a little bit more traction on the commercial HVAC side, and GST continues to gain a little bit of share. But again, generally everything is improving about as we had expected in China there.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And secondly on the Aerospace Systems aftermarket, did you actually say what the aftermarket revenue growth was in the quarter? It would be helpful if you could spell out how much was provisioning.", "Jay Malave", "Total aftermarket revenue growth was up around 10% in the quarter. It was led by\u2014again, spares were up low teens\u2014spare sales were up low teens in the quarter.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And the amount that was provisioning?", "Jay Malave", "Provisioning sales \u2013 let\u2019s see. Those\u2014I have orders, Robert. I\u2019ll have to get back to you on the sales element of provisioning versus parts.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, but I imagine this could be quite lumpy, this provisioning.", "Jay Malave", "Yes.", "Gregory Hayes", "Provisioning is very lumpy, so that 28% growth that we saw here in Q2, don\u2019t look for that to repeat. But again, it\u2019s primarily 787 related, which is good news. A lot of airlines out there are taking new aircraft, which leads to all of this provisioning. The trend will continue, but just not at that 28% rate.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "So you had a flat compare in orders in Otis China against a very stiff compare, but if you look at the monthly data on residential housing prices, it looks like it\u2019s rolling over. What\u2019s your expectation for orders in the third and fourth quarter, and for growth in China Otis next year?", "Gregory Hayes", "I wish I had a crystal ball, Cai, to answer that question. Generally I think the thing to think about in the back half of the year is backlog, which is up about 20%, so we\u2019re expecting about 15% sales growth. So we\u2019ve got, I would say, the backlog to carry us through, at least through this year and even into next year. Orders have continued to be good. Last year, orders in the second quarter were up 39%, obviously on the back of that one large order, but when you take out the Tianjin 117 order last year, orders were up about 14 or 15% this year on an apples-to-apples basis, so the trends have remained positive in the business.", "Back half of the year, is it going to slow? Probably. I think again, is it going to be somewhere between 5 and 10%? Perhaps. We\u2019ve seen the Chinese economy is cooling a little bit, but we still expect growth of 7.5%. Residential prices, we know have been moderating and even coming down in some markets, and that\u2019s a big piece of our business; but infrastructure has more than taken up the slack where we\u2019re seeing the drop on the residential side.", "Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Terrific. Then kind of getting back to spares, Boeing is saying they\u2019re going to have about 16 to 18 new customer introductions this year and the same next year; and next year, we also have the A350 coming online, so maybe give us some color on the expectation for continuing vigor in provisioning \u2013 I mean, maybe not at 28% this year and next year.", "Gregory Hayes", "Look, that\u2019s all baked into what we consider to be the guidance for this year, which was high single digits \u2013 you know, 9% kind of growth in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket. Clearly the introduction of the 787 to all these new customers is what\u2019s driving the provisioning growth this quarter and will continue to drive it into next quarter, so it\u2019s great that this plane is going to so many new customers. It really does support a lot more provisioning, although not everybody gets provisioning \u2013 some people go on our total care package, where we\u2019re actually providing the spares for them. ", "But again, I think the trends that we\u2019re seeing this year, there\u2019s nothing out there that would tell me those trends should not continue into next year, but I think it\u2019s a little early to start talking about \u201915 guidance.", "Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Greg, you\u2019ve had a lot of restructuring items, and I appreciate some of the walk; but could you talk a little bit about tax rates for the second half of the year? I mean, we know a 16% rate in this quarter is not sustainable, and then I\u2019ll have a follow up.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yeah, I would ignore the ETR \u2013 the effective tax rate \u2013 in this quarter because, again, all these one-time tax-related items that we had \u2013 you know, the settlement of the \u201909 and \u201910 tax years, a couple of other minor adjustments \u2013 the rate wanted to be about 31% in the quarter on an operating basis. Back half of the year, we\u2019re expecting about 29%, so again a little bit of better news in taxes coming up but not a lot. The wild card out there, of course, is extenders, which we still don\u2019t have in the guidance; and whether that happens this year or not, I think nobody knows, but obviously it still gives us upside if it does.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "To follow up, that 29 does not include some of the benefits that you\u2019ve outlined that you\u2019re likely to recoup or record as gains during the balance of the year, right?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yeah, there\u2019s about $0.25 of additional gains we\u2019re going to see in the back half of the year on top of the $0.28 that we picked up in Q2 on the tax rate. So when I\u2019m talking about that 29% rate, that is operational \u2013 that\u2019s not, I would say, the reported rate. We will pull all those gains out of the math for you so that we can try and keep it clean in terms of operating result.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "So those gains also include the Watsco benefit that will show up in the third quarter?", "Gregory Hayes", "The Watsco benefit \u2013 you\u2019re talking about the option exercise?", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Yes sir.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, it\u2019s small. It\u2019s not very big at all.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Then the last thing is, just to go to Pratt, we\u2019ve had these collaboration intangible benefits for some time that have helped the numbers. How do you sort of see that playing out, and doesn\u2019t that sort of help the reported results at Pratt over the intermediate term before you transition to the GTF?", "Gregory Hayes", "So you\u2019re talking about the collaboration benefits associated with the IAE transaction, Cai\u2014or I\u2019m sorry, Howard?", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Usually I get confused with George!", "Gregory Hayes", "Sorry, Howard.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "That\u2019s all right \u2013 thanks, Greg. Yes, I am. I mean, some of them, I know, are installment payments in effect to Rolls, but the balance reflects, I think, pricing of engines. Doesn\u2019t that sort of help the Pratt numbers?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well in fact, you really need to go back to the original IAE transaction where as part of the consideration for Rolls transferring its share of IAE to Pratt, we agreed to give them higher pricing on the OE side, so that was really part of the purchase consideration. So the losses on the engines actually go up as a result of that, but under the purchase accounting rules, that becomes an intangible. As we ship those engines, those losses go into intangible asset, really part of the purchase price. ", "And also, it starts to shrink dramatically because those are only engines that were in backlog as of the day that we closed on the IAE transaction. All the new orders for these that we\u2019ve had don\u2019t reflect any of that benefit, although they do reflect the higher price we pay to Rolls Royce on their share of the engine. So yeah, it\u2019s out there. It was all contemplated, at least the collaboration piece, all contemplated as part of the overall consideration, just like the flight hour payments.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Just two quick ones for you. Your prior guidance, I believe, had $0.05 in it for the Canadian Maritime helicopter. Now that that\u2019s out of the guidance, how come you guys didn\u2019t take up the higher end of your range by a nickel or so, which had the previous guidance for the Canadian Maritime in it? Make sense?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yeah, your precision exceeds our accuracy, though. The fact is you\u2019re right \u2013 we did have $120 million baked in for the CMH. The back half of the year, there will still be about $50 million of CMH-related costs in addition to the charge, so nominally we could have picked up a little bit. We did take Sikorsky\u2019s guidance up about $25 million, but they\u2019ve had some much slower military aftermarket sales than what they had expected and they had some EACs that have gone against them in the first half of the year, so they\u2019ve consumed about $50 million of the good news associated with what should have been guidance on the CMHP. ", "So really, we\u2019ve only increased by $25 million, which is a couple of pennies, and we just didn\u2019t feel like we were going to take up the top end of the range for two cents.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then switching over to Climate Controls and Security, in the quarter the margins were really good, right \u2013 19% before the one-time stuff. How should we think about that for the remainder of the year? That\u2019s a pretty darn good trend, right?", "Jay Malave", "Yes, it\u2019s a great trend, Rob, but don\u2019t forget the second quarter is typically the heaviest, particularly on the U.S. residential side, so you\u2019ll always see a stronger margin percentage in the second and third quarters. That will come down sequentially. There will still be margin expansion over last year, but you\u2019re talking probably on average in the range of, say, 17% in the back half of the year.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Was there any one-time positive things in there, big sales or something that\u2014", "Gregory Hayes", "No, it was a very clean quarter, no one-timers or anything like that. Everything got pulled out that would have been a one-timer, so a very clean quarter. Just, again, good performance on the cost side, good traction really around the whole business from a cross standpoint.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning everyone. Greg, I wondered if you might be able to just actually provide more detail on what the C-series engine fix and resolution is and how the implementation of that is going to play out, because what we can see in the press has been fairly high level and it sounds simple, but I guess the aircraft has now been grounded almost two months, so any more detail there would be really helpful.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I didn\u2019t get my engineering degree, unfortunately, so I\u2019m not going to be able to give you probably the technical answer that you\u2019re looking for. We do know\u2014I mean, we identified a root cause of the engine oil seal leak early on in the investigation. We have a fix in place. We\u2019re continuing to work with the customer \u2013 Bombardier \u2013 to work with the Canadian airworthiness authorities to get the plane flying again. We expect it will be a couple of weeks.", "Again, this is not a big, big deal in terms of the architecture. It\u2019s happened back in the turbine section and has nothing to do with the gear up front, and really a relatively minor fix. It\u2019s unfortunate that it happened when it did in the testing program; but again, not a big fix in terms of engineering development costs.", "Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, but it\u2019s seeming like another couple of weeks before the aircraft are back in the air, it sounds like?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yeah, I can\u2019t give you anything better than that. I think that\u2019s what we heard earlier this week, and I know the folks at Pratt and Bombardier are working as hard as they can to get that thing flying again.", "Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Jay, you were about to give the Aerospace Systems spares order provisioning versus parts breakout. Can you actually just provide those numbers in the quarter?", "Jay Malave", "Yes, the provisioning was quite high \u2013 you\u2019re talking in the range of 80%, and the parts were flat.", "Gregory Hayes", "Sales or orders?", "Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Orders.", "Jay Malave", "Parts were flat\u2014I\u2019m sorry. ", "Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Deane Dray with Citi Research.", "Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research", "Morning everyone. I might have missed this, but for Otis China orders, what was the attachment rate, and maybe some broader context of where you expect to see that trend over the next year or so with the new regulations.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think the conversion rates, or the attachment rates as you\u2019re referring to them, I think are pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen where we\u2019re getting somewhere around 60% or so on the Otis China brand, and a much lower conversion rate on the XOEC and the Sigma brands. Again, you\u2019ll recall we sell direct at the Otis China Limited and we\u2019re selling through distribution, so attachment rates in total are still around 25%, I think, across the portfolio, nudging upwards a little bit as we\u2019re trying to make a big push towards the aftermarket. I think aftermarket there, or service there, grew 20% last year. We expect it to grow another 20% this year, and we added 50 branches last year and are in the process of adding another 50 branches this year. So we\u2019re putting the infrastructure in place to support the continued growth in the service, and the real key will be for us to work with our distributors through the distribution model to make sure that we can capture more of the aftermarket or conversion from the XOEC brand.", "Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research", "Great, and then on capital allocation, just the update that you\u2019ve given us this morning, boosting buybacks and maybe cutting back on that placeholder on M&A, just put this in context for us. And also, how are you funding the buybacks? Most of your cash is offshore, so what\u2019s the expectation in terms of funding those?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well again, we\u2019re working to get some of that cash back as tax efficiently as we can, but as I sit here today, I think we spent less than $90 million on M&A through the first half of the year, and it\u2019s just a realization as we\u2019re sitting in July, we\u2019ve got a couple of smaller deals in the pipeline, but you\u2019re talking less than $250 million or $300 million each, so hard to imagine we\u2019re going to get towards that billion-dollar placeholder. So we just took it down directionally, and we\u2019ll give you more guidance at the end of September.", "Again, we\u2019re taking up the share buyback, and looking at the price over the last month or so, we\u2019ve obviously been trading down. It\u2019s a very attractive investment in terms of our M&A dollars, so we\u2019re going to put more there and we\u2019re going to be patient on the M&A side. ", "Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays", "Morning guys. Just a couple of quick ones. Greg, you said the CMH, the charges going forward would be manageable, but I think last quarter you said the charge you were going to take was going to be about 70 to 75% of the total loss, which would imply if that didn\u2019t change kind of $125 million or so to go. Is that still the right order of magnitude, and how should we think about the phasing of that over that next two years?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, so just to be clear, when we took the charge for the $438 million, that included all the losses going forward on the program and included an extension of the initial in-service aftermarket training and support, which actually drove the loss higher because instead of putting these aircraft in service in \u201915 and \u201916, it\u2019s going to take it out through 2021 before we\u2019re done, so that drove about another $100 million of losses that we\u2019re going to recognize as part of this whole charge.", "If you think about it, back half of the year we\u2019ll probably see, as I said, $50 million, about $25 million a quarter. Next year, the total number goes\u2014it\u2019s around $20 million a quarter, not quite, and then really after that it becomes noise because the aftermarket starts\u2014they start to accumulate hours on the aftermarket, which more than offsets any of the losses that we\u2019re going to have as we complete.", "So we\u2019re about 70% done. We\u2019ve incurred about $700 million of losses on that program, so you can nominally think there\u2019s about $300 million to go between now and 2021; but the real headwind is third and fourth quarter this year and then next year, and then it\u2019s really behind us.", "Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays", "Okay, great. That\u2019s great color. Thanks. Then just as a quick follow-up, Jay, you mentioned in you remarks the difference in unit order growth versus dollar bookings at China Otis. Could you give us those numbers?", "Jay Malave", "Yes, the unit bookings were up \u2013 I think Greg mentioned it in his remarks \u2013 were up 12%.", "Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays", "Okay, thank you very much, guys.", "Gregory Hayes", "Thanks Carter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Good morning. Greg, in terms of organic growth in the second half, you mentioned the comps get a lot tougher yet you\u2019re forecasting organic growth for the most part in line with what we saw in the first half. Can you just talk about kind of at a high level what\u2019s going to drive that?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, there\u2019s a couple of things. I mentioned before we didn\u2019t get a bunch of the JFS engines out the door at Pratt. That contract should be done here in another month or so, LRIP 7, so that\u2019s going to help on the military side at Pratt. We continue to see a ramp on the Aerospace Systems side, aftermarket is going to continue to grow. I think again, as I look at the backlog today, it really supports the back half sales forecast. Orders down 6% at Pratt in the aftermarket, but total aftermarket was still up 10%. We\u2019re seeing heavy overhauls going through the shops. It looks like it should be pretty achievable to get to that 4% growth. I think clearly Otis has the backlog, not just in China but around the world \u2013 you see new equipment orders continue to grow. CCS has good backlog in its businesses and really no\u2014again, could bad things happen? Absolutely, but really as we sit here today, I feel pretty good about the overall economic growth in our markets.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Okay. On GTF, you mentioned some of the wins at Farnborough, but looking at versus your competitor, it looked like your competitor actually announced more orders and it looks like market share has kind of shifted a couple points in favor of the Leap. So could you just talk about how you think GTF is doing overall in the market and what kind of pricing you\u2019re seeing on GTF relative to what you\u2019re realizing on B2500s? Thanks.", "Gregory Hayes", "I think again it was a big air show. I think GE announced a lot of orders in conjunction with G-cast. We\u2019ve got right now about 6,200 engines, I think, on order \u2013 we said 6,000, I think right now it\u2019s about 6,200, and we\u2019ve got just about 50% market share. It\u2019s lumpy \u2013 I mean, these campaigns happen sporadically where you\u2019ll be 100 or 200 engines that get awarded at a time. GE has been successful in the last couple of weeks.", "At the end of the day, I think the market will decide which technology is best, and we still think the GTF architecture in terms of what it does for fuel efficiency, from a noise, from an emission standpoint, is going to outperform the Leap in the marketplace, and that will ultimately be the determinant of what the market share is. ", "In terms of pricing, pricing is tough, but it\u2019s always tough in this entry into the service space, so I would say there\u2019s not much difference that we have seen in terms of market pricing dynamics, but it\u2019s a tough market out there.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just a couple of clean-ups. The order rates at Pratt in particular, can you just help us with the split between the Vs and maybe the 2000 and 4000, 4000 in particular?", "Jay Malave", "Yes, the order rates, the Vs were up high teens. The 2000s were down substantially \u2013 70%-plus, again on that tough compared. The 4000s were down around 10%, in that range, and again a little bit of just timing of shop visits there. We actually saw\u2014on some of the older models, we\u2019re seeing nice content per visit and we actually saw nice growth on the older models, so it was actually some of the newer models that showed a little bit more weakness, and that again is more of a function of just timing.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "As you look out to \u201915, can you give a rough proportional mix \u2013 is it still about 50/50 between Vs and other, or is it going to be 60/40 by that point in time?", "Gregory Hayes", "The Vs are essentially growing at 10 to 15%, and I would say the older engines would be flattish going forward so you\u2019re going to see that mix shift continue to where it\u2019d probably be 55% and going towards 60%.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Then the other clean-up \u2013 Jay, the contract benefit size on UTAS, can you size that?", "Jay Malave", "Yes, it\u2019s about $0.03.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, all right. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Yes, good morning. The aero margin looked weak to me, particularly with what you size as the gain. I mean, you were down sequentially from the first quarter and revenues were up a couple hundred million, so can you just tell me what was going on there?", "Jay Malave", "George, it was basically the E&D. They were up\u2014in E&D, this was the highest quarter of E&D at UTC Aerospace Systems, and we expect that to come back down in the back half of the year.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yeah, they accounted for all of the increase in E&D in the quarter.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Okay. Then how much was the gain at aero in the quarter?", "Jay Malave", "That was\u2014", "Gregory Hayes", "You\u2019re talking about the contract settlement?", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Yes.", "Gregory Hayes", "Three cents.", "Jay Malave", "Three cents.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Okay. I meant to ask this \u2013 Pratt, you had also mentioned there was some gain. How big was that one?", "Jay Malave", "Oh, less than $20 million.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Jay Malave", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to our hosts for closing remarks.", "Gregory Hayes", "Okay, thanks Kevin, and thank you everyone for listening in. A solid quarter and we\u2019re on our way to a solid year at UTX, and look forward to taking your calls this afternoon. Thanks again.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Akhil Johri, Vice President, Financial Planning and Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's home page at www.utc.com.", "The company reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statement. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay. Thank you, Gevan, and good morning, everyone. As you guys saw in the press release this morning, another solid quarter. 6% organic sales growth and orders generally in line with expectations despite an uneven macroeconomic environment. ", "Earnings per share were $1.47 in the quarter and that's up 13% and free cash flow was robust at 132% of net income.", "There's a lot of uncertainty and things to worry about in the world economy, and things like continued high unemployment in the U.S. and Europe, a weak U.S. housing sector, the banking crisis in Europe, the political impasse in D.C. to name just a few. But importantly, order rates across most of our businesses remain generally in line with our expectation for the year, sustained by continued strength in emerging markets and a resilient commercial aerospace aftermarket. The developed economies have certainly slowed a bit over the past few months and commercial construction markets remain particularly weak in the U.S. and Europe. But the economies in China, India and Brazil, while slowing slightly, are still delivering growth rates well above developed economies.", "Also, airline traffic continues to hold up and capacity discipline is expected to result in another profitable year for the airlines. In addition, Boeing and Airbus, holding a large backlogs, have both announced increases in their build rates, buoyed by emerging market demand and replacement of older, less fuel-efficient fleets. So uncertainty, clearly, but we've operated in this kind of uneven and uncertain economic environment before and we know how to respond. ", "With a slower macro growth outlook, we're taking preemptive steps to position the business to grow earnings next year by taking out even more costs as we -- even as we continue to invest in growth areas and in bringing new technologies to market. So we're increasing our restructuring estimate this year from $200 million previously to $300 million plus, while keeping to our commitment of restructuring equal to onetime items for the year.", "We still see sales for this year at around $58 billion, that's up about 7% from 2010. And with better than expected third quarter results and only one quarter to go, we're once again increasing our EPS guidance. We now expect 2011 EPS to be up 15% to $5.47 a share. That's up from our previous guidance of $5.35 to $5.45.", "The higher EPS outlook reflects benefits from lower interest costs, lower taxes and higher profits at Sikorsky, partially offset by lower profit expectations at Fire & Security, and around $0.05 of deal costs related to the pending Goodrich acquisition.", "On Slide 2 now, turning to third quarter results, as I mentioned, sales grew organically at 6%. Carrier had another strong quarter with 9% organic growth driven largely by continued strength in the Transicold business and growth in emerging markets. And Sikorsky grew 21% organically, with higher aftermarket sales and more military aircraft shipments. ", "Earnings per share were $1.47, that's up 13%.  Restructuring expenses of $0.06 in the quarter were partially offset by $0.04 of net positive onetime items. In comparison, restructuring and onetime items in last year's third quarter was a charge of $0.09. So excluding restructuring and onetime items in both third quarters, earnings per share increased this year by 7%. Lastly, FX was a benefit of about $0.04 in the quarter.", "Now just the usual reminder that we're going to talk to our segment results excluding restructuring and onetime items. And on that basis, the segment operating margins of 16.3% in the quarter was 10 basis points lower than last year. These benefits from cost reduction and operating leverage from higher sales across the businesses were more than offset by higher E&D investments. E&D was higher by $62 million versus last year's third quarter. All of that increase was at Pratt & Whitney as they continued to develop 4 separate Geared Turbofan platforms. ", "As I mentioned earlier, free cash flow in the quarter was 132% of net income. That's great performance, even as we contributed $156 million in cash to our domestic venture plans. In addition, we also contributed $450 million of stock to the plans this past quarter. Even at the current low interest rates, our domestic pension plans are now nearly 90% funded, and we don't see the need to make additional contributions to our domestic pension plans through at least the end of next year. ", "With year-to-date free cash flow at 109% of net income, we now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed net income. We spent $675 million on share repurchase in the quarter and this concludes our share buyback for the year with a total spend at $2.2 billion. You'll recall that we decided to suspend share buyback for the next 12 months as a result of the Goodrich transaction.", "Okay, Slide 3. As you can see from these order trends, order trends are generally in line with expectations, with the exception of some weakness at Fire & Security. Commercial aerospace aftermarket remains solid, with Pratt & Whitney's large commercial engine spare orders up 3% for the quarter, and that's on top of 35% growth in the last year's third quarter. Hamilton Sundstrand commercial spares were up 24%. That's after 13% growth last year. Carrier's U.S. residential HVAC orders increased mid-single-digits in the quarter. However, we did see a shift in consumer buying patterns with more and more customers opting for lower featured, lower efficiency products. At Otis new equipment orders were up 12% at constant currency, driven by emerging market growth. And we continue to see strong growth in the emerging markets with a combined BRIC orders for the Commercial businesses up a strong 23% this quarter.", "So despite a slowing world economy, we saw another good quarter with strong organic sales growth, solid earnings growth and robust cash flows, all while we continued to invest in these game-changing technologies. ", "I'll come back in a minute to talk about the remainder of '11 and our outlook for 2012. But for now let me turn it over to Akhil to take you to the business unit detail.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. At Otis, both sales and profits in the third quarter grew by 12%, with operating margin of 23.7%, in line with the prior year. Foreign currency accounted for approximately 8 points of profit growth and 7 points of sales growth. ", "New equipment sales in the quarter were up 9% at constant currency, led by strong growth in China and Russia. Service sales were also up, with continued growth in contractual maintenance and repair. The positive impact in operating profit from higher sales volume and some real estate gains was partially offset by new equipment pricing and commodity headwind. ", "As Greg said, new equipment orders increased 12% at constant currency, with continued strong growth in emerging markets, led by China. Their orders were up over 30%. Orders in North America were flat, and were down low single-digit in Europe. Otis closed the quarter with a strong new equipment backlog, up 9% versus prior year at constant currency. We remain confident in full year profit growth of about $225 million at Otis on high-single-digit sales growth. ", "On Slide 5, Carrier profits increased 13% on 8% higher sales. Organic sales growth was 9%. As expected, Transicold's first half organic growth rate of about 50% has moderated to high teens. ", "Similar to the second quarter, North America residential shipments were mixed, with split system units up mid-teens and gas furnaces down mid-single digit. Profit growth was driven by solid conversion on volume and continued good performance in our joint ventures, partially offset by commodity headwind. Carrier posted a record Q3 operating margin of 12.7%, even as we saw a significant movement in the U.S. Residential business towards low-margin, entry-level units.  Carrier remains on track with our prior guidance of profit growth of about $325 million on 10% organic sales growth. ", "UTC Fire & Security delivered profit growth of 8% in the quarter on 5% higher sales. Organic sales were up 2%. Product businesses were up high single-digit and service and install businesses were down low single-digit due to continuing softness in the U.K. and Americas businesses. Third quarter orders were flat year-over-year organically. Backlog continues to be strong, and is up approximately 15% organically, both year-over-year and from the beginning of the year. Operating profit in the quarter grew 3% at constant currency. Benefits from higher overall volumes and a favorable litigation resolution were partially offset by continuing productivity challenges and a very soft market in the U.K. ", "With a slowdown in the order rates and continuing productivity issues, we now expect full year sales at Fire & Security to be up mid-single digits on 3% organic growth and operating profit to be up approximately $100 million instead of $150 million.", "Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up slightly from the third quarter last year. Sales from higher aftermarket and increased large commercial engine deliveries were partially offset as expected by fewer military engine deliveries, lower Rocketdyne and power system sales and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Large commercial engine spares sales were up about 10%. Operating profit in the quarter was down 11%. The benefits from net higher sales were more than offset by high E&D and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. These structuring savings offset higher pension costs. Excluding E&D, operating margin was about flat. We continue to expect Pratt's full year operating profit to be down around $100 million as we continue to invest in next-generation product platforms.", "Hamilton Sundstrand posted another solid quarter with profit growth of 11% on 8% higher sales. Sales growth continues to be led by the Aerospace aftermarket and industrials businesses. Notably, commercial spares were up more than 30% versus last year. Aero OEM sales were flattish as commercial aero growth was offset by lower space and defense volumes. Profit growth in the quarter reflects the benefit of higher aftermarket and industrial sales and lower E&D, partially offset by lower military vehicle sales and higher new program warranty costs. Operating margin was up 60 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%.", "As Greg said, commercial spares orders increased 24% year-over-year, with book to bill slightly above 1. Industrial orders were up about 10% at constant currency. Based on Hamilton Sundstrand's strong year-to-date performance, we now expect operating profit for the full year to be up more than $100 million on high single-digit sales growth.", "Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 9. Operating profit increased 34% on 21% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 73 large aircraft, 9 more than the third quarter of 2010. 66 aircraft is on military platforms and 7 commercial. There were no deliveries of Canadian Maritime Helicopters in the third quarter. The contract requirement is for 4 additional aircraft in the fourth quarter, but customer discussions indicate that need may be only for 2 or 3 more. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by higher international military aircraft deliveries and increased aftermarket volumes. Solid conversion on net higher sales resulted in margin expansion of 110 basis points to 12.1%. Of note, during the quarter, Sikorsky delivered 3 S-70i aircraft to its launch customer in the Middle East. These deliveries marked the first for Sikorsky's international variant of the BLACK HAWK. For the full year at Sikorsky, we now expect profit growth of approximately $125 million on sales growth of high single digits. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thanks, Akhil. So it was another good quarter.  We have strong organic sales growth, earnings growth and cash flow, all of that in the face of a slowing worldwide economy. We're very confident in our increased EPS guidance of $5.47, and $58 billion of sales for the year. That's up 15% earnings on 7% sales growth. That's the kind of performance you come to expect from UTC. ", "As you know, we've announced some transformational news recently. First of all, of course, the largest acquisition in our history, in fact, one of the largest aerospace acquisitions ever, Goodrich Corporation. It's a strategic transaction that will boost UTC's position in the Aerospace Systems sector, and will generate significant customer and share owner value. As you know, Goodrich products are complementary to UTC's and our combined technologies will provide more intelligent, more electric and more integrated products that customers are increasingly looking for. Also, Goodrich has a stable and strong aftermarket, with higher content on newer platforms, similar to Hamilton Sundstrand. We're bringing together 2 great companies. As we said earlier, we expect this deal to close in mid-2012, and we would expect it will be accretive to EPS in 2013.", "Last week, I'm sure you all saw we also announced agreements with Rolls Royce to acquire their share in the IAE joint venture, as well as to partner on future engines for mid-size aircraft. Most significantly, utilizing Geared Turbofan technologies. When this transaction closes, we'll likely consolidate IAE, which will result in incremental sales at Pratt & Whitney in 2013 of over $1.5 billion, representing the remaining 2/3 of IAE. We also expect an operating profit benefit in 2013 of $75 million to $100 million, which is largely Rolls Royce's 1/3 share of IAE's profits, partially offset by the amortization of intangibles. This deal will also streamline support for the A320 family of engines, enable a smoother transition of V2500s to the GTF platform, and provide significant long-term benefits to Pratt & Whitney's aftermarket business from the increasing installed base.", "The new partnership agreement with Rolls Royce is further validation of the game-changing GTF technologies. In the meantime, the GTF development programs at Pratt remain on track, meeting all the key milestones and performance benefits of fuel efficiency, noise and emissions.", "Also, you'll see -- you probably saw we announced 2 key organizational changes. These changes will allow us to continue to drive growth and margin expansion on both the aerospace and commercial side of the business. Our seasoned management team will build on the same agenda that's made us successful: portfolio transformation, offering integrated systems and solution to our customers and continued cost reduction. ", "So we talked about our increased guidance this year and some transformational news, but I'm sure what most of your are interested in, of course, is what about 2012? So let's look at 2012. This is on now Slide 11. As always, a lot of puts and takes at this time of the year. The outlook for some of our end markets certainly feels weaker today than just a few weeks back, and we're certainly looking at tighter DOD budgets. Although longer term, we will benefit from being on the right platforms such as the JSF, the 53K and the BLACK HAWK programs. And international military markets still offer significant opportunities despite the DOD budget cuts.", "Yields on 10-year corporates have come down. Of course that puts pressure on our pension expense. At a discount rate of 5%, we'll see around $0.15 of headwind next year. Not much we can do about interest rates, but we have done the tough things in sunsetting the U.S. pension plan. So a little time and a small rise in interest rates, this problem is going to go away. It will be in the rearview mirror. ", "And we talked in the past about E&D at Pratt peaking in 2012. Again, that will be a headwind for us next year. Again, more detail on that in December. Also, assuming a mid-2012 close, the Goodrich transaction will be dilutive to earnings next year by about $0.30 to $0.40 from financing and other deal costs, accounting conformity, amortization of intangibles and restructuring costs. Of course, we expect this deal to be solidly accretive in 2013 and beyond as we start to realize the synergies and get some of the onetime costs behind us.", "On FX, that remains a big unknown. Just within the past few weeks, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most currencies. The euro, as you know, went from $1.45 in late August to $1.32 in early October, and now it's back at $1.38. Given this volatility, we'll make a call on FX rates for 2012 as we get closer to our outlook meeting in December. And of course, you all know the impact FX can have on UTC earnings, both positive and negative. But really too early to make a call.", "Of course, we know how to operate in uncertain times. We're increasing restructuring in 2011 and this will generate additional savings in 2012, and our companies are better positioned than ever to grow earnings with a strong aftermarket, significant presence in emerging market and high content in the growing Commercial Aerospace segment. So in spite of all the headwinds, the uncertain economic environment and the Goodrich-related dilution, we still expect earnings growth in 2012. As is our normal practice, Louis will provide detailed guidance on 2012  at the December 15 Investor Meeting in New York.", "So, solid results year-to-date, and we're confident on delivering our increased outlook of $5.47 a share, 15% earnings growth on 7% sales growth. We see a strong trend in emerging market orders even as developed markets have shown signs of weakness recently. We've stepped up our cost reduction efforts and continue to drive margin expansion, not just this year, but into 2012 and beyond. And as always, we're committed to grow earnings even in a difficult environment. We have a seasoned management team, and we're focused on what we can control: that's cost and operational excellence. ", "So with that, let's stop and open up the call for questions. Gevan?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And first in line, we have David Strauss with UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Greg, you talked about ratcheting up restructuring this year. Can you give us a sense, any quantification of what kind of tailwind that would provide next year, not only the additional restructuring you're doing this year, but also the benefit of 2009, 2010 restructuring.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. So again, we're going to take up restructuring from $200 million to $300 million plus. We've got some good news coming out on the tax line that we see. We've got visibility to a gain on a disposition. So restructuring equals gains for the year. I think that's first and foremost. As I think about next year, we're going to see at least $200 million of tailwind from restructuring into 2011 -- I'm sorry, into 2012. We're going to do some additional restructuring at Sikorsky as we size the business for what's happening in the marketplace. I think, as you're always also looking along with Scott Buckhout, at some additional reductions on the commercial side as they bring those 2 businesses together. So there's lots of things to do and some of that's actually going to be good short-term payback.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, again thinking about next year, I know FX is a moving target but I think for Pratt Canada, that should be locked in at this point. Can you talk about the headwind there? And then from a commodity standpoint, given the moving copper and steel, what kind of tailwind that could provide next year?", "Akhil Johri", "David, this is Akhil. For Pratt Canada, you're right, most of it is locked in. We expect about $50 million headwind next year as the Canadian dollar was still stronger than the U.S. dollar versus what we had hedged before. On the commodities, we deliberately put it on a question mark column right now because the copper goes down to close to $3 then wants to start to go back up. We'll see how it all shakes out, and Louis will give a greater guidance, more detail, in December.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think it's important to note though, I mean, commodities, we have seen pricing is stuck on the Carrier side. And we have moved prices up on Otis as well in response to some of these commodities. So for the year, although it's still going to be a headwind of about $150 million, I think we've got about what? 50% of our copper locked in for next year already. So again, I think, as these prices that Carrier announced, they take effect October 1, those stick, it shouldn't be a huge headwind.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And last one, on the interest expense line, you had talked about, first it was going to be relatively flat, then $50 million lower. It looks like it's going to be a lot lower now than 2010?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, it is David. And some of it, if you'll recall we talked about having an issuance of about $1.5 billion early fourth quarter, and now we are moving that out because we've cut back our share buyback, our cash flow is coming in stronger than we expected. So that's all good news. And that's what we're reflecting in this increased guidance.", "Operator", "Next online, we have Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Just first on Goodrich, Greg, can you give us a little more granularity on the $0.30 to $0.40? Certainly applaud you for taking it all in and not ignoring it, if you will, but how much of it is actually kind of deal-type noise versus kind of true kind of economic restructuring?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, let me try and give you the pieces here as best that we can do it today. And I just want to stress here that we're still -- these are preliminary numbers because there's some big moving pieces, like on the accounting conformity side. But you're going to pick up about half of your Goodrich earnings assuming a late June close. Then you've got about $200 million of actual deal costs. And that includes the integration teams. So that's a cost -- most of that goes away in year 2. You're probably down to $25 million or so of just continuing integration teams. You've also got interest on the new debt which is about $200 million. I think they've got about $70 million of interest on their old debt. Accounting conformity, we're guessing, on a full year basis, that will be about $300 million in the first year so a half year is $150 million. But again, that's -- remember, excess over average is going to go away down there. The preproduction E&D is going to go away. We still need to work through the details, but let's say that's $150 million. Intangible amortization is about $300 million. $200 million of that's for inventory write-up. We've got to write up their inventory, amortize their inventory turns. So that happens relatively quickly. And then there's the customer intangibles, another $100 million. And that gets spread out over the next, I don't know, 10 or 15 years. And of course, you've got the equity issuance. We've assumed in the math here, you're going to do a $4 billion equity issuance, about 50 million shares. That costs about $0.15. So those are all the pieces. I think by the time we get to December with Louis, we'll have a little better feel for that, we'll have some of this stuff nailed down, determine the timing of the debt and all that. But kind of broadly where we are.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And are there any substantial deal costs with closing the IAE deal? Will that deal be modestly accretive post-closing or is it dilutive in 2012?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, it should be modestly. And I say modestly accretive. The fact is we're not borrowing any money, we're not using any bankers. And I tell you, issuing debt and using bankers is very expensive. So we're not going to do that with the IAE transaction. We're going to use foreign cash, and we'll see just a little bit of good news at Pratt & Whitney next year. But again, probably a mid-year close there and maybe just a $0.01 or so of accretion.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Okay. And finally for me and I'll pass it on, could you just speak to China demand, kind of step back larger across all UTC? I mean, obviously the Otis orders look pretty good. It sounds like HVAC is decent. Just the whole state of play there, kind of the tensions in the country on potential of slowing demand versus the reality of the fact that there's still quite a bit of activity, and how you see things playing out over, say, the next 2 to 4 quarters there?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "You know, it's interesting. We all read, of course, we saw the GDP slowed down all the way to 9.1% here. We haven't really seen it. I told the guys yesterday, we haven't seen a stop sign or even a yield sign in terms of the growth. We're continuing to make very good traction. Otis orders were up like north of 30%. I think Carrier was almost 20% up. The only place where we've seen any sign of weakness was really at Fire & Security and a little bit at our Sullair, which is the Hamilton Industrial business, that Compressor business, and those are really infrastructure projects where we've seen a little bit of a slide to the right. But in terms of the commercial construction, the social housing and the effects of the urbanization trends, those all continue apace. So we feel very good really for the next year on China. It will no doubt slow down if the world economy slows down, but these macro trends that have existed for the last 10 years around urbanization continue. All right? I mean, the West is still growing, if not on the East, and we're participating in all those markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So maybe give us a little bit more color on Rolls. I mean, they talk of this deal adding USD $220 million of converted. You talk of it adding, what was it, $80 million to $100 million in op profit. Maybe walk us through the pieces there. And is that number a full year number? Is it before amortization? How much is amortization?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Again, the deal here is a little bit of complex, and it's unfortunately the accounting makes it even more so. But if you think about this, Cai, we paid $1.5 billion for the collaboration rights associated with Pratt's -- or I'm sorry, with Rolls' investment in IAE. So we get that 33%, and we're going to pay them $1.5 billion at close. The second piece of the deal is we're going to pay flight hour payments over the next 15 years, and in return for those flight hour payments, we're going to get the intellectual property and the engine designs and the right to produce all of those parts that Rolls is currently producing. All of that gets hung up on the balance sheet as an intangible that we'll build up and we'll amortize that over the life of the program. So we'll see, as I said, very modest, next year, accretion of about $0.01. The following year we get about 75 to 100. Again, that's all in after amortization. So -- and it gets more and more accretive every year. And again, as you stop the engine deliveries on the V2500 in 2015, 2016, it becomes even more accretive because then all you have is an aftermarket stream for the next 30 years. So I think -- we paid a fair price, but there's a greater return on this. And it really is just about monetizing what's going to be a great aftermarket stream on the V. Importantly, I think, what really set this deal apart from us is Rolls Royce has validated the GTF technology. The fact is the next mid-size aircraft, whatever that will be, we're going to be in a partnership with Rolls and we're going to use the GTF as a baseline configuration. And that, of course, is a big turnaround from where we were just a few years ago. I think it's important -- I think the IAE joint venture, our relationship with Rolls has certainly morphed over time. It's much better today, and I think this deal is just a further personification of that.", "Akhil Johri", "One of the benefits, Cai, is the smooth transition, as Greg mentioned, for moving the customers from the classic 320s today to these neos. And I think that's another big positive to this whole transaction.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Now clearly with the growth in the aftermarket annuity, it's a great deal. But maybe help us understand, roughly how much is the amortization likely to be on an annual basis. Is it straight line? Roughly how much is the cost of the OEM engines to Rolls? Those kind of questions, so we get a sense of the leverage in the out years.", "Akhil Johri", "Cai, I don't think we want to get into those details. It was a private transaction and I can probably help you a little bit more afterwards, but that's...", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I'll tell you we're still, of course, working through all this with regulatory authorities, too, Cai. I think as we get closer to the deal close and everything is done, we'll have a better view of all this. We still have to value all the intangibles. But you can think about we're going to be building that intangible over 15 years and amortizing it out. It'll build up. So you're not going to see straight-line amortization. But we can get you those details as we get closer to the deal close.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then the last one, you talked about kind of issuing 50 million shares, but really kind of going through your cash flow, it would look like you could get away with less. Tell us kind of what's the range in terms of the size of the equity offering and kind of flexibility you have if the stock price is a little lower, as it is today.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "As part of this whole transaction with the rating agencies, we've modeled in the 25% equity issuance of some form, be that a straight equity issuance or be it some combination of mandatory converts or equity. The fact is we're not going to issue stock at $75 a share. That's significantly undervalued. That's why we didn't use stock in the pricing of the deal. We're going to be opportunistic about this in terms of when we issue the equity and how much equity and what form that takes. In terms of using foreign cash, clearly, if we can bring cash back from overseas, if we see a change in the tax law that makes it more efficient, it reduces the need for equity. And If you think about it, at the end of the deal, we're going to have debt to cap is going to move from 32% to call it 48%. That was the ratio that we agreed to with the rating agencies. That's why I think Moody's reaffirmed our rating. Why we continued to have the A1, P1 on the commercial paper. Now, if we bring cash back from overseas, it reduces the amount of debt. It will also proportionally reduce the amount of equity so that we can keep in line. It's not dollar for dollar, but it's just proportionate, trying to keep that debt to equity. What's really important though is if the law changes, and we're able to tap into that foreign cash, 60% of our cash is overseas. It allows us to do a lot more investing here in the U.S.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "You're -- on the Goodrich deal. Obviously, we recognize you're paying for technology, but also, for people. Can you -- the concern, of course, is that people can walk out the door. Can you talk about how you're handling the potential loss of talent with Goodrich, given this 9-month period of uncertainty where, obviously, Goodrich talent is susceptible to being poached. How are you and Goodrich management kind of help -- working together to kind of prevent that and keep people steady as she goes while we go through this kind of 9-month period of question mark?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It's a great question, Heidi, and I think it's something that I know that Marshall Larsen and Elaine are working on. We're going to have -- bring 2 great companies together, as I said, and we've got great people at both companies. And the key here is to retain the great people in those businesses. And I think, again, we're going to work -- I know Tom Bowler, the HR guys are working with their HR folks to make sure that we've got the right incentives in place so that we don't lose the talent. Elaine and Marshall are going through identifying what the new organizational structure is going to look like. And the sooner we get this deal closed, the easier that it's going to be. And it's all really about the people. Great technology, but without the people, it doesn't mean anything. They've got a performance culture. We've got a performance culture. We're going to merge the 2 of them together.", "Akhil Johri", "Heidi, the best example I gave to this question is Greg Hayes himself. He came through an acquisition and look where he is at UTC. So UTC offers great opportunities for people who perform.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "But are you guys able to get in front of these guys and talk about retention guarantees or things that -- again, obviously, when we see large deals like that, one of the worst things that we've seen commonly happen is the poaching of kind of the best talent during that period.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Heidi, all I can tell you is we think UTC is a great place to work, and I think -- it's Elaine and Marshall's job in the coming months to make sure we convince the Goodrich folks and the Hamilton folks that there's a great future here. And look, it's always a risk, but it's certainly on the radar screen and we're working with people. We can't do very much. We just filed Hart-Scott-Rodino this past week, we're just doing the regulatory filings. But as much as we can, we're reaching out to the people and making sure they know that they're an important part of the future of these great businesses.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Are you getting any color on whether this deal could potentially close sooner or can you make that case, that it helps make sure that you retain more of the company if you could close sooner?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Look, it's really -- we just filed Hart-Scott, so we'll see. In 30 days, we'll hear back from Justice, and then we've got the European and Asian filings to do. I think it's -- we're going to stick to the kind of June closing time frame here, and if it's better -- sooner is better, no doubt, for many, many reasons. People being one of the big things. But we'll work through this as quickly as we can.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then one final question on it, and it's just a nit, but are there any terms and conditions in the deal concerning how Goodrich does, kind of better or worse, during this period? Because obviously, management had kind of a high sense of how they were going to do. You've done your best due diligence, but if they don't do quite as well, is there any repricing potential?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No. Look, they're a public company. They've got share owners that they've got to satisfy. They've got a performance culture there, as I said. They're going to make their numbers that they've committed to. We feel very confident in the forecasts that they showed us, both for this year and the next. And I think they'll release earnings here in the coming week or so, and I think it'll probably be just about in line with what everybody expects.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And I think I know the answer to this question, Greg, but one last final on my part. The CSeries is obviously -- we see what's happening in the news there. Can you talk about what this means in terms of any additional headwind this might portend for GTF on the neo? Does R&D change on that?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I'm sorry, Heidi. Were you talking about the CSeries in terms of the schedule or...", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Well, just in terms of there may be a question as to its future, obviously. But I think that there was some leveraging that you were expecting to happen on what you were doing on CSeries that could translate into neo, and that may not necessarily be intact.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Look, they are different engines, although they have the same essential core. It's just scaled up from the CSeries to the neo. But that's really the extent of the synergies in terms of the testing and in terms of the design. So look, we think the CSeries is still going to be successful. We haven't seen a lot of orders recently, but we still think long-term this is going to be a great airplane in its niche, which is 105 to 130 seats. It's fuel efficient, it's got great technology and it's going to be successful. And really there -- it's going to be out there. We're on time with the engine. We expect to -- I think to have it certified by the end of next year, for entry into service in 2013 still. So we're still going full speed ahead.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about what the order trends were in the Transcold business on the container and the reefer side?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure. Shannon, I think the truck trailer side has seen some reduction in orders, which is not surprising. I think some of the fleets, large fleets in the U.S, booked big orders early in the year, and have now slowed down. So we've seen significant reduction in the North America truck trailer orders on a year-over-year basis, although year-to-date, still very strong. At Europe, truck trailers slightly down year-over-year as well, although containers continued to remain very strong and we're almost 2x what the orders were last year in the third quarter. Now compares there are likely to get tougher in Q4, but so far so good.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe a little bit more about what's going on at Fire & Security, and also what you kind of hope to accomplish with the consolidation of Fire & Security and Carrier?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "The combo with Carrier and Fire & Security is going to create an $18 billion business. It's going to be headed up by Geraud. I think the key for that combination was really this focus on building controls. You guys will recall the IBS integrated building system strategy that Louis has been talking about for a couple of years? This is really the endgame of that strategy, how it's going to play out. We've created a Controls business under Mark Berry, I believe, at Carrier -- or what are we calling it? The Climate, Controls & Security Systems, CCSS. And I think that the controls is the linchpin to this whole thing. At the same time, we're going to run the playbook that we've run at Carrier for the last 3 years. There's going to be portfolio transformation opportunities, there's going to be cost synergies, and it's going to be a great business on a consolidated basis. I mean, 2 very good businesses and we put them together. Importantly, we're still on track, I think, for the margin targets that Louis laid out. It was 12% for Carrier and 15% for F&S. We're still going to get there next year on a consolidated basis.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I mean kind of looks like Carrier is running ahead and Fire & Security behind. I mean is it fair to say that the consolidated comes a little bit more from Carrier beating and Fire & Security missing?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Look, I think -- we have an opportunity next year for F&S to get to the 15% on a standalone basis. Part of that was work through portfolio rationalization. Part of it is also from a recovery in some of our markets. If you think about the $50 million drop we've just taken in the guidance at F&S, really, the key there was our market in the U.K. I think that business is down earnings about $60 million year-over-year. We've seen some big market issues as the government in the U.K. has contracted spending. We've seen some margin, we've seen some productivity issues. That's really the problem. I think, again, we'll get that issue behind us. Once we do that, and we focus on some of the portfolio transformation issues at F&S in terms of culling out some of the underperformers, we still feel confident we can get to the 15% on F&S.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And final one, is transforming that portfolio going to be some additional divestitures or I mean -- or is there going to be an acquisition component to this, given your desire to build more into the building automation side of things?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think yes to both sides. I think, obviously, there's some opportunities there to cull the portfolio at F&S. Geraud and team have just started working with Scott and his team on that. I think they've got some ideas already. We'll hear more about that in the coming months. But also, Mark Berry's Controls business is an opportunity for acquisition over the medium term here. So again, I think it's both things we'll be doing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Greg, I was wondering if you could talk about the Aerospace aftermarket. Clearly, contrasting results on the orders between Sundstrand and Pratt. I was wondering if you talk about what the underlying drivers are here, and whether it is just comps year-on-year?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, comps is a big thing. Pratt was up 35% in orders last year in the third quarter, up 3% this year. Hamilton was up, I think, 13% last year, up 24% this year. If you dissect the Hamilton orders, though, what you see is that the Parts business, kind of that ongoing, recurring spare parts, was up about 10%. So pretty -- not nearly the robust 24% that we talk about. It was really provisioning on 787 that drove the order growth at Hamilton. And again, this is the long-awaited payback for that big investment we made in the 787. And that's going to drive growth at Hamilton next year as well. This is really just the start of the provisioning cycle on the 787.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And do you expect the sort of numbers between these 2 divisions to maybe converge going forward because they are so big at the moment?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Unfortunately, I think the businesses are just fundamentally different. Hamilton is on every platform out there and they -- obviously, as you see the new aircraft come to market, they're going to see provisioning orders, they're going to see parts for every aircraft, commercial aircraft out there. Pratt is a little bit more limited. I'm mean you'll see growth, obviously, from the V2500 fleet. You got the 4000s out there, you got some 2000s. But you would expect, I think, stronger growth in the aftermarket at Hamilton in the coming years as opposed to Pratt. We'll start to see again the V2500 pick up even more stronger now that we've got the Rolls Royce share and then the GTF at the end of this decade will pick up significantly.", "Akhil Johri", "The other thing to keep in mind is Pratt spares are also driven by the cycle time on the engines, and when they come in for overhauls. I think that does drive the timing of the spares a little differently based on the profile of the engines coming in for repair work.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the industrial side, Greg, it does look like some of your shorter cycle industries have weakened on the order front in the third quarter. Do you expect this deteriorating trend to continue into the fourth quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Actually, if you think about it, orders at the industrial businesses in the third quarter, I think were up about 11% at constant currency. Sullair was up 8%. I think Sundyne was up strongly, and Milton Roy was up nicely. So all of the businesses on the industrial side of Hamilton were good. On the commercial side of the business, I think you're going to see, again, fairly decent order trends from the emerging markets. The U.S., we're not seeing anything here, right? And on the commercial construction side. Europe, nothing much on the commercial construction side in the Euro zone. We are seeing strong growth, of course, from Russia, Poland and those markets, but Europe, not much. But again, all kind of in line with what we expected for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "To go back to something you talked about, Greg, earlier, in terms of repositioning and sort of a focus. You've done 2 large deals in a short order of time and you've hinted at some divestitures. Is this just going to be a different effort at reshaping United Technologies' portfolio?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "These deals, although they got announced within a couple of weeks ago, really have been in the works for well over a year. And I think Louis and the rest of the senior management team, we've been looking at the entire portfolio here, and this is really just part of the overall strategy at UTC, which we want to have growth businesses in growth markets. And I think -- and we're positioning the company to be exactly that. And this portfolio analysis is not a onetime event. It's something that we're going to continue to do, continue to look at opportunities, both on the acquisition and the divestitures side, to better position UTC for long-term growth.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's what I gather. And hence, also the management changes in terms of focus and emphasis. I guess that's all part of it.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It is indeed.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 small related items. One is, can you talk a little bit about the Maritime Patrol Helicopter and sort of what are the issues? I mean this has been an ongoing challenge to get it right. I mean they -- frankly. And then just one other item, if you can answer that. You had a small -- what's the size of the real estate gain at Otis?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Real estate gain at Otis was how much?", "Akhil Johri", "About $15 million, Howard, the real estate gains at Otis. So about a $0.01.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "About a $0.01. As far as the CMH, look, we have an agreement with the Canadian government, we were to deliver 6 interim configuration aircraft this year. The final configuration aircraft will be delivered starting at the middle of next year. We've had some issues with some software glitches. We've had some other issues, but the helicopters are ready to be delivered. I think it's just a question of aligning the customer requirements right now. And I know Jeff and the team have been working with our friends on this for quite some time. And we have the helicopters. They're being built down in Stratford, they're ready to ship. It's just a question of what the customer needs at this point.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I mean I still don't understand what that means. Is that -- I mean are we going to see larger losses because of the further delays? And that's the good news is we're going to get them behind us this year and next year more profitability?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No. I think, in fact, we lose, I don't know, $10 million, $12 million a copy on these helicopters, and that's not really changing in terms of the timing of the deliveries. You're still going to see headwind next year and into '13 as you deliver the remainder of the 28 helicopters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just had a question on your commercial businesses. I mean you mentioned that in Carrier, you'd seen some trading down. I just wondered more broadly, obviously, if the volume outlook in commercial for low level, it's managing to deteriorate further in developed economies? You mentioned pricing earlier, but if you see volumes weakening and you see a mix shift, are you worried that pricing generally -- when you look at what your competitors are saying and doing, are you worried that pricing generally may start to moderate in the coming months as you see volumes soften and commodities have leveled out?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "To be clear, I don't think we expect to see volumes softening any more than they already are. If you think about Carrier's Residential business here in the U.S., I think the total market for split systems is about 4.7. It's been kind of banging around the bottom there for the last 2 or 3 years. We haven't really seen any growth. At the same time, as commodities have increased, I think we have seen some pricing traction. But the real issue there in the business is voice to consumer sentiment. Last year, we had stimulus-related benefits, there were rebates that allowed customers to trade up to higher efficiency units. The stimulus is gone, those tax credits are gone. So because of the consumer sentiment here in the U.S., consumers are only buying what they need to buy and they're buying entry-level, lower-featured products. And so think about the business in the U.S., I think we were up about 8% in the quarter in terms of units, but total sales were flat because, again, you've traded down. So now 75% of what we're selling is entry-level series 13. So, look, it's hard to imagine it's going to get any worse than this, but there are still 93 million or 94 million air conditioners out there in service today that have to be replaced. There's not much going on in the housing market, we don't expect growth in the housing. At the same time, we've got a good position in terms of our cost. We continue to take cost out of the business, continue to drive margins in that business. And when the market recovers, and it will, we're going to be well positioned to get great operating leverage there.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then if I'm comparing the new equipment orders organically for Otis and Commercial HVAC, Otis has been outgrowing the HVAC orders for the last sort of 6 months or so. Do you think that's sustainable for any particular reason in terms of geographic weighting or new products or anything else?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. It's all about China. You think about where Otis is positioned in China. They saw 30% orders growth right there. Carrier saw about just under 20% growth in orders. And I think it -- the market position that Otis has is just phenomenal. We've got about just north of, I think, 22%, 23% market share. We go to market in 4 different price points in the China market, and they've got a very strong team in place in China. Carrier, good team. They've got good market position. But I think, again, just because of the weighting and the size of the Otis China business, it's going to drive higher growth there.", "Akhil Johri", "And then one other factor, Julian, is that in China, Otis benefits from social housing, which is more of residential type of air conditioning. So like-for-like, while Otis benefits from the residential sort of social housing, Carrier does not. So I think that is a part of the difference as well.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then just one final one. You mentioned some of the restructuring going into Sikorsky. On the commercial side though, both Bell this morning and Eurocopter last month have sounded very positive about what's going on there. So could you just give an update on the different trends in Sikorsky?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Again, I think what we're seeing on the military side, BLACK HAWK production has probably peaked this year and it will probably stay about flat into next year. What we are seeing growth on the military is on the international side. I think we shipped 3 of -- the first 3 S-70i's out of Mielec this quarter in fact. On the commercial side, order trends have not been great. Right now, again, we're transitioning from the S-76C++ to the 76D. I think we'll have that aircraft certified mid-year next year, we'd expect orders to pick up. But in the interim, I think we'll be done delivering S-76s here at the end of the year. S-92 continues to sell well for the oil and gas fleet. And again, I think it will be a good story, but it's not going to be a great high-growth story for next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's early, and we're not going to steal any thunder from December here, but just wondering if you could tie up all the changes to the 2012 puts and takes landscape and give us a sense whether you think 10% plus, excluding Goodrich and IAE, is still a reasonable place to be thinking at this point?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Look, we're targeting 10% earnings growth, Terry, for the businesses. I think, again, that the 2 big question marks we have right now really are around FX and pension and what happens there. But the base businesses, I think, we're going to continue to push them to get towards 10%. We're doing the restructuring now. We're doing whatever we can to try and make sure that, that happens. You've got these big kind of unknowns, though, around FX and what's going on in terms of the developed economies and the macro environment. I would tell you, x Goodrich dilution next year, we're going to outperform the peers. We've taken the hard action, we've done what we needed to do on the pension side. We've rightsized the business. And so I think, again, you'll be happy, I think, with the guidance that Louis provides in what is a very tough economic environment.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. It's helpful. And then in terms of you made a comment -- we talked a lot about different specifics. I just want to make sure we're clear on your earlier comment that just in the last few weeks, you've seen some incremental weakness in end markets. Are you talking about sort of the truck markets? Can you just be clear with us in terms of which end markets you're really thinking of in that particular comment?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think as I look at the Carrier and the Residential business in the U.S., and we had a very strong start to the third quarter. I think July was good and then August things started to slow down and even a little further in September. Truck trailer is the same kind of phenomenon. There was a lot of early ordering, and so we've seen orders pull back on the truck trailer in the North American market. And I think, again, as we're seeing consumer sentiment in U.S. and in Europe, given the banking crisis in Europe, consumers are pulling back and not spending.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, on the DOD spending outlook for 2012, has anything changed with your thinking there?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think it's all about as we had expected. I think we'll wait and see what the super committee comes up with here. We're hopeful that the folks in Washington are going to be able to come together and come up with a reasonable plan with the deficit and hold the defense spending in line. The worst thing that could happen is stalemate, of course, in the super committee because the DOD budget cuts would be huge. And I don't think anybody wants that to happen. I don't think anybody is going to let that happen.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It sounded like you're a little more optimistic on the international sales, defense sales next year, or am I reading too much into that?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think it's just a continuation of what Jeff's been talking about for the last couple of years. We've positioned the business to have a great product offering, that's the BLACK HAWK, at a low-cost manufacturing location. And it continues to get traction. There's orders out there for Turkey, there's orders out there for Singapore, for Saudi. I think there's lots of opportunities.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Back to the Rolls agreement for a second. Does the relationship essentially between you 2 remain stale until there's actually a platform to pursue? Or is Rolls going to start to share in the core R&D that you'd have ongoing for the next gen of the GTF?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think -- they'll continue to be a part of the IAE joint venture because they're going to continue to supply their share of the engine for some period of time until it transitions to us. In terms of investment in the next generation platform, we're both going to go down the path of making sure we've got the best possible technology when that platform becomes visible. We're going to be investing, of course, in the gear; they're going to be investing in other important parts of the engine. So when the thing does come together, we both have the latest and best technology to offer.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Are you pursuing dual architectures or similar architectures with split responsibility?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think -- it's going to be a GTF architecture. This is not going to be a 3-spool engine. This is going to be GTF, and it's going to be a single platform.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So they are sharing in the core R&D starting as soon as this agreement is done.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, as soon as we have visibility to what the next aircraft is going to be.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then on Sikorsky, the guidance of $25 million increase in EBIT, is that, from Akhil's comment, sounded like potentially a couple of CHPs were shifting out. Is that essentially what's causing that or is it better performance as well? And I guess, are you expecting the same number of CHPs or has that number slipped out?", "Akhil Johri", "No, I think, Myles, you're exactly right. It is the shifting of the 2 CMHPs, if you will. That's what we have taken into account in our forecast here. Their operating performance, even without that, is pretty good as is. So I think they are tracking well towards delivering on the margin expansion and the growth and the profit that we were expecting. This shift will probably not impact 2012 as such. It may move to 2013 in terms of the deliveries that we miss, if any, this year.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Got it. And the last one. Hamilton's spare book to bill, is it below 1?", "Akhil Johri", "Slightly above 1.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Slightly above.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Nadol.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-ups here. Just on Fire & Security, between productivity and demand, which has the bigger impact on your numbers? And could you just speak a bit more specifically, if possible, about what you're referring to with productivity? Is there one facility that's underperforming in the U.K., et cetera?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "If you think about the $50 million drop, about half of that is actually from lower volumes. Orders were essentially flat here in Q3. We had expected, I think, 5% or so organic growth for the year. We're not going to see that. So that's the biggest piece of this. You've also got a little bit of bad news on FX versus our last look. And then you've got the U.K. issue. I'll say, the productivity issue is not just U.K. It's really the field organization where we had expected significant productivity benefits from all of the restructuring actions. We just haven't seen any -- the traction we had expected to see in the field in the Installation and Service businesses. And the U.K. market is tough. We've recognized that for the year. It's worse than what we had expected. We're focused on it. These operational issues, they happen. We know how to fix these things. I think that's what Geraud and Scott and the team are focused on right now, is fixing the field productivity issues and fixing the issues that we've got in terms of performance because it happens. It's unfortunate. But we're on top of it, and we're going to get it fixed.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. In both of these businesses that are coming together, Carrier and F&S, you're looking at -- I'm sure there's going to be some integration from a top-level standpoint in terms of overhead. At the same time, you're looking at divestitures from within -- it seems to me, at least, within both businesses, certainly within Carrier still working on the International Residential, and with F&S you've implied there's some opportunities. So in terms of a chicken-egg situation, which is coming first? Are you really starting now and looking at divestitures or are you going to bring the whole thing together and then look at paring some of the businesses off?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think -- we have been looking at this portfolio transformation at F&S really for the last year or so. So we're closer on that than you might think. Timing-wise, Carrier is further down the pipe in terms of some of its divestiture opportunities, and they're continuing to work some of those things. And so I would expect you'll see fourth quarter this year, early into next year, hopefully the conclusion of that portfolio transformation. And then it will start to pick up, I would think, on the F&S side of the business in the second half of next year.", "Akhil Johri", "And Joe, you'll recall we have been doing stuff at F&S as well. The man-guiding [ph] business, which is the low margin, has been out of the portfolio pretty much now over the last few years. So it is something they've been focused on. But with Geraud's additional oversight, I think they'll probably get some more things done faster.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, you may have already given this, I may have missed it, but in terms of the pension for next year for the overall company, if current rates kind of stay where they are, what's the headwind?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It's about $0.15. And that's at a 5% discount rate. That assumes, I think, a 3% return on assets this year. So we'll see. For every 10 basis point change in the discount rate, that costs us about $20 million of expense. So you guys can do the math. We'll see where we are on December 31. Unfortunately, there's nothing to do until then.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Deane Dray from Citi Investment.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a couple of clean-up questions. The first is the Otis China escalator problem, has that all been resolved?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think in terms of the root cause, we certainly have understood that. We understood that right away with a supplier issue with a bolt that was undersized. I think, again, we're still working with the authorities in Beijing to make sure that they understand our quality control processes are intact and that it's never going to happen again. It's an unfortunate incident, but again, like any other problem that we find, we get to root cause, we get it solved and we make sure it doesn't happen again.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And then I might have missed this, but the expectations for fourth quarter in the price cost, how does that net out? You said that Carrier is facing some additional headwinds this quarter. What's the expectation?", "Akhil Johri", "I think next quarter, Carrier will see the benefit of pricing. The commodities are still a headwind. So I think net-net, we'll still see a little bit of headwind, but it is going to be a lot less than what we have seen in the third quarter.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one, back on Residential Carrier. Greg, you talked about the mix shift and the focus on buyers towards the lower end 13s here, but it also raises the question of whether you're at a disadvantage in not having a lower price point brand to begin with. Sort of the good, better, best, you're skewed towards the better best brands with Carrier.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "In fact, we do have 3 brands. If you think about it, Carrier is the premier brand out there and it's the higher efficiency products. You have Bryant and you have Payne at the entry-level. And I think Payne at that price point competes very, very effectively. In fact, that's where we've seen most of the growth is coming at that low entry line, Payne. Again, it can meet -- it's got a great cost footprint, and it's very competitive on the low end. So I don't think we've lost any share. In fact, we've probably maybe even picked up a little bit as we've been able to leverage that low-end brand.", "Akhil Johri", "And Carrier has the scale. As you know, they are the market leaders, and they have the scale to bring the costs down and they continue to work on that every day.", "Operator", "Let me turn it over to you guys for any closing remarks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thanks, Gevan. Thanks, everybody, for listening. So another solid quarter, and we're confident in our improved 2011 outlook, and we're positioning UTC for 2012 with increased restructuring this year and a commitment to grow earnings, even in this tough macro environment. And beyond 2012, we've aggressively invested in strategic deals to transform the business, and we continue to invest in strategic technologies to grow the business over the long term. So thanks all for listening. I'll remind everybody that we'll be in New York on December 15 for an evening with Louis to talk about 2012 in detail. Have a great day.

", "Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir. ", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, Amy and good morning, everyone. As you can see from our earnings release this morning, this is another strong quarter for UTC. As usual, Ken will take you through the business unit details in just a minute and then Ken, Jim, and I will take your questions. ", "First, let me just spend a couple minutes on a highlights of the quarter. First, on revenues, up 13% to $13.9 billion with organic growth strong again at 10%. We're now in our fourth year of solid organic revenue growth. Since 2004, annual organic revenue growth has equaled or exceeded 7%. That is a direct result from the innovative new products, our strong presence in emerging markets, and robust global commercial aerospace and construction markets. ", "Leading the way in revenue growth this letter was Sikorsky, which grew revenue 56% as a result of strong demand and continued recovery from last year's strike. Excluding Sikorsky, the aero businesses saw 11% organic revenue growth on continued strength from both their OEM and aftermarket businesses. Commercial companies in aggregate grew 5% organically, led by Otis, which again saw new equipment orders growth over 20%. ", "Foreign exchange also accounted for the remainder of the growth as the second quarter year over at a $1.35 was significantly higher than last year's second quarter average of $1.25. Earnings per share $1.16. That is up 6% over last year and that includes uncovered restructuring charges of $0.02, while second quarter of last year included a net $0.07 gain in excess of restructuring. Absent the onetime gains and restructuring, earnings were up 16%. ", "So from an earnings perspective, this was a solid quarter across the entire UTC portfolio, with all six business units develop delivering double-digit earnings growth, including restructuring and onetime items. Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton both benefited from strong global aero markets and Sikorsky, which delivered 49 helicopters in the quarter, remains on track with their recovery plan and production ramp. ", "On the commercial side, as noted, Otis continued to gain market share globally while still delivering best-in-class margins. Fire & Security delivered another quarter of solid earnings growth and 120 basis points of margin expansion. Carrier also had a very strong second quarter with earnings up 13% and 50 basis points of margin expansion. ", "Balance works at UTC and balance works at Carrier, where strong performance in commercial HVAC, international residential HVAC, and the refrigeration business more than offset the weakness in the U.S. residential business, where earnings were down more than 30%. ", "Jarrod and his team remain committed to deliver earnings growth of $150 million this year despite higher commodity costs and a U.S. housing slump, which looks to be significantly deeper and longer than we or most others thought even six months ago. On cash flow, again, performance very solid in the quarter. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion, reaching 104% of net income. ", "Inventory, especially within the aerospace companies, does remain in issue. Total inventory has now increased $1.3 billion since yearend. Now, about half of that is attributable to the normal Carrier seasonality and a little bit to FX, but the remaining issue, or the remaining increase is really due to the strong organic revenue growth of the aero businesses and the resulting tight aero supply chain we've been talking about. ", "Although we remain focused on improving our processes throughout the aero supply chain, realistically these higher inventory balances will continue to be a drag on cash flow as long as organic growth remains robust. What we're doing to offset this inventory drag is to focus on collecting cash from our customers, both from receivables as well as in the form of advances. ", "So despite continued inventory growth in the quarter, overall working capital performance was quite good. As a result, we still expect that for the year free cash flow will equal or exceed net income. ", "On the acquisition side, we continue to expect acquisition spending for the year to be about $2 billion. You'll note that on July 2nd we completed our purchase of most of Rentokil's electronic security business, including businesses located in the Netherlands, UK, and the U.S., giving us a strong market position in each of these countries. ", "A note on share repurchase. In the quarter we repurchased $500 million of our stock, which brings our total year-to-date to $1 billion. You should also note that in June we increased our quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.32 a share. That is effective with our September payout. This reflects our confidence in the sustainability and strength of the businesses going forward. ", "Now, given the solid first half results and the strong outlook for the second half of '07, we are also raising our full year revenue guidance from $51 billion to $53 billion and we are increasing our full year 2007 guidance for EPS to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.25. That is 12 to 15% growth year-over-year. ", "So with that, let me turn it over to Ken to take you through the business unit details. ", "Ken Parks", "Thank you, Greg. Before I begin on page three, let me remind you that I will talk to segment results with restructuring added back and excluding one time gains, just as we usually do. ", "Otis delivered another strong quarter with both profits and revenues up 13% over the prior year. Favorable foreign exchange contributed more than a third of that growth. Revenues increased in all geographic regions, with double-digit growth in North America and Asia. Revenue continued to shift toward more new equipment with higher new equipment mix than last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. ", "In spite of the mix shift, Otis was able to deliver strong margin performance at 18.9%, equal to last year's second quarter and 40 basis points higher than the first quarter. Higher volume and continued cost containment initiatives helped to mitigate margin pressure from the higher new equipment mix, headwind from escalating commodity and labor costs, and continued new equipment pricing pressure in Asia. ", "New equipment orders continue to be robust, up 26% year-to-date with notable strength in China, the U.S., France, Russia, and India. Given the continued strong performance and favorable FX, we now see Otis revenues increasing at near double-digit for the year, up from our prior guidance of mid-single digit growth. And operating profit is now expected to be up $200 million plus, up from our prior growth guidance of $175 million plus. ", "At Carrier, operating profit increased 13% year-over-year on 8% higher revenues, resulting in 50 basis points of margin expansion. Favorable foreign exchange contributed three points to both revenue and profit growth. Carrier continues to benefit from worldwide geographic balance as double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the building systems and residential and light commercial international businesses more than offset continued softness in the U.S. residential market. ", "We saw a good start to the European cooling season and our commercial business is experiencing both healthy markets and the benefits from new products and prior-year restructuring actions. Carrier's refrigeration business also grew earnings double digits on the benefits from lender restructuring and a robust first half container market. ", "In the U.S., the soft housing market continues to impact our residential business, where we had a 5% revenue contraction in the quarter. The market is particularly weak in the new construction segment, which amplifies the impact to Carrier given our strong position in this area. This combined with our previously announced investments to launch a company operated distribution network in California will impact Carrier's second half results, primarily in Q3. ", "Building systems, residential international, and refrigeration continue to perform well in good markets and we remain comfortable with Carrier's full year guidance of $150 million of earnings growth on mid-single digit revenue growth. At Fire & Security, performance was solid, as revenue was up 16% and profits were up 36% in the quarter. Favorable foreign exchange contributed about six points of the revenue growth. Organic growth in the quarter was 2%, reflecting double-digit growth at Lenel and in Asia, while Australia continues to be weak. ", "Operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points year-over-year driven by the benefits from Kidde integration efforts, in particular the completion of the Fire Europe factory closures as well as other previously announced restructuring actions. Favorable foreign exchange added about 9 points of the profit growth. Year-to-date results are tracking to current guidance of operating profit growth of $125 million plus on mid-teens revenue growth. ", "Pratt & Whitney revenues increased $381 million, or 14%, in the quarter, led by growth in the large commercial engine business. Commercial aftermarket revenues were up mid-teens. New engine volume growth continued at Pratt & Whitney Canada with revenues up midteens on about 20% higher year-over-year engine deliveries. Power systems revenues are up over 50% in the quarter, while revenues in military engine business were flat. ", "Operating profit growth of 15% reflects the contribution from higher second quarter aftermarket and engine revenues partially offset by the impact of higher year-over-year commodity costs and increased E&D spending. ", "We continue to expect Pratt & Whitney to deliver solid results for the year and we now see 2007 revenues up high single digits, up from our previous guidance of mid single digits, with operating profit growth now expected to be $200 million plus. ", "Hamilton Sundstrand's revenues were up 10% and operating profit was up 14%. Following the trend of recent quarters, performance was solid in the aerospace aftermarket and the industrial segments, both with double-digit revenue and operating profit growth. ", "R&D investments, principally on the 787 program, continued to be a headwind and given the year-to-date spending, we currently expect full year 787 R&D to be slightly higher than 2006. Better mix and cost performance more than offset the impact. We now see full year revenue growth of low double-digits with operating profit growth at $100 million plus. ", "At Sikorsky, revenue was up 56% with profits up 43% over last year's levels, which were depressed due to the recovery from the strike. Second-quarter profit was up sequentially from the first quarter and is in line with our outlook of continuing sequential profit growth each quarter throughout 2007. ", "During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 49 large helicopters, 29 military, and 20 commercial. For the year, we now see 170 large aircraft deliveries compared to earlier guidance of 160. Given Sikorsky's performance year-to-date and what we expect in the months ahead, we are revising full-year guidance upward to over 30% revenue growth and now expect operating profit growth of $150 million plus. ", "Now let me turn it over to Greg to wrap up. ", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, Ken. So as you have heard, it has been a very strong start to 2007, with solid execution across all of our businesses. As we look ahead to the second half of 2007, we see a continuation of this, robust top line growth and continued solid execution from all of our businesses. Global demand remains strong in both the commercial aerospace and commercial construction markets. ", "Although the residential new construction market in the U.S. remains depressed, you should remember that this portion of the Carrier business represents only about 2.5% of UTC's estimated $53 billion of revenue. ", "Commodity prices look to be a headwind in the second half, as copper prices have remained stubbornly high. Although some of this may be offset by the continued benefit of a weak U.S. dollar. A little bad news on commodities and maybe some good news on FX. ", "We will also continue to evaluate opportunities to make additional investments in our businesses. As an example, we now expect R&D investments to exceed last year's total by more than $100 million. We also expect that for the year restructuring costs will now exceed one-time gains. ", "Likewise, we continue to expect make investments in ERP systems and the ACE operating system and in Carrier's distribution network, as Ken noted. All of this with an eye towards long-term sustainable growth. So, a great start to 2007 and a solid outlook for the remainder of the year. ", "As we noted our press releases morning, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $53 billion with a forecast now of high single-digit organic revenue growth. Likewise we're increasing our estimate of full year EPS to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.25 and that includes the $0.07 charge associated with the Otis EU matter back in the first quarter and the $0.02 of uncovered restructuring here in the second quarter. We also expect to meet our usual standard of free cash flow equal to or exceeding net income. ", "So with that, let's open up the call for questions. ", "Questions-and-Answers Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Howard Rubel with Jeffries & Co. ", "Howard Rubel - Jeffries & Co.", "Good morning. Thank you very much. Just two questions, one, if you look at the Carrier results and we back out the currency, then on kind of a real basis there is still a little bit of deterioration in the business. Is that's a fair way to think about that? ", "Ken Parks", "The growth rate of Carrier was 13% and about 3% of FX, so X FX you're talking operating growth of around 10%. ", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.", "Yes, but, I mean the fact, Ken if I look at it in terms of guidance, you didn\u2019t really -- there was no real change there and yet you had better than planned currency year-over-year. Is that a fair way to think about that? ", " Ken Parks", "Howard, that is right. If you think about it, Carrier has had a benefit from FX going forward. We've talked about that and we've seen that in the results. I think what you're seeing that is offsetting that, of course, is commodities. There is about $50 million of higher commodity costs in Carrier's numbers for the year, which has really offset the benefit of FX. ", "In Resin, of course, is a lot worse than what we had thought even a few months ago, so I think it\u2019s fair to say business is not better than what we had thought, but I think the three other parts of the business, that is that make up 80%, that\u2019s the commercial HVAC, international resin, and the refrigeration businesses are hitting on all cylinders. So I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as anything other than a very strong performance in Carrier. ", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.", "I hear you and I mean, that\u2019s the opportunity you have. I mean, you're not yet at the point where you see that market bottoming, though, do you? I realize every time anybody has made a step, it has been wrong. ", "Greg Hayes", "When we started the year, we thought about 5.9 million units in the U.S. residential market. We think that is probably more like 5.5 million today. We had thought we would see a second half recovery and I think everybody today would tell you it\u2019s going to be '08 and perhaps even late '08 before we see a real recovery in the U.S. housing market. ", "But again, I think Jerrod and team have done what they need to do. They're taking costs out. They're closing factories. And they are keeping their cost structure in line and making investments at the same time to prepare ourselves when that market recovers. ", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.", "I agree, I mean, especially with some of the things you\u2019re doing in the distribution area. And then the second thing is just to turn to Pratt, a very impressive aftermarket. How would you characterize the split there between unit and price? ", "Greg Hayes", "I am not quite clear how to answer that question. As we look at aftermarket, we're talking, you know, a very strong aftermarket performance. The spares were good, book-to-bill about one. Price increases, most of that of course come with our annual catalog price increase at the end of the year, so I wouldn\u2019t characterized the revenue growth as really much related to spare parts pricing increases. ", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.", "So it\u2019s been very much an\u2026 ", "Greg Hayes", "It\u2019s a volume statement. ", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.", "It's volume, then. That\u2019s terrific, thank you. ", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, Howard. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take the next question from Ronald Epstein with Merrill Lynch. ", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good morning guys. ", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning. ", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Just a follow on maybe Howard's question, can you just give us a feeling for the aftermarket for Hamilton Sundstrand in the quarter? Was it price? Was it volume? How'd that go? ", "Ken Parks", "Again, I think we would go back and tell you it\u2019s the same as Pratt, which is volume related. And the aftermarket at Hamilton was up mid-teens, high-teens in the quarter. ", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then just maybe two more quick follow-on. There\u2019s been a lot of press lately about potential foreign military sales for Sikorsky. Can you give us feel for your outlook for that and where that stands? ", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah, I think that it\u2019s actually a huge opportunity for Sikorsky. We recently purchased the Mielec aerospace business in Poland to give us a base for international Black Hawk. We've had good luck in the Middle East with the Saudi Arabia ordering Black Hawks as well as others. Turkey has continued to order. ", "I think the goal long-term, of course, is you have to have a cost competitive offering and I think this is going to be a big opportunity for Sikorsky. As you know, I think the U.S. military is pretty well sold out going forward with our $9 billion backlog, but still big opportunities with the FMS business. ", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "I read -- there's been press reports I think like there might be like 130 helicopter sized opportunity out there if you add them all up. Is that about right? ", "Greg Hayes", "I guess I'm not really comfortable commenting on the exact size of the market. I know we have certainly won our fair share of the market, we believe, with the Black Hawks. ", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just one last final question. Thinking about geared turbofan now, kind of what milestones as kind of outsiders looking in and should we be looking for progress on that program? ", "Greg Hayes", "Well, there's really two milestones I think that I would keep in mind. Here in the fourth quarter, Pratt expects to run a demonstration engine, a ground run, and that is all on track as we look at it today. And then probably mid next year we\u2019ll actually do a flight test of the engine. ", "Again, I think all of that is on track. We're spending a little over $100 million this year, probably a similar about next year, but the program looks to remain on track. ", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks Ronald. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Steve Binder with Bear Stearns. ", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "Good morning. ", "Ken Parks", "Good morning Steve. ", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "A couple things. One was I would just like to, maybe I missed it on commodity headwind for the corporation, the total number for the quarter and how was that allocated by business? ", "Ken Parks", "Yes, the total corporation for the quarter was about $60 million net and that was primarily at Pratt. Carrier had about $70 million in commodity headwind gross in the quarter that they were able to substantially recover through price. ", "And the Pratt headwind is consistent with what we have said before, which is primarily nickel, nickel alloys, and other specialty metals. ", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "Okay. And then, second with respect to all these margins, maybe if you can just touch on new equipment margin here. I know you talked about the headwind from new equipment mix, but if you just tried new equipment versus service on a year-over-year basis, how would you characterize the year-over-year variance? ", "Greg Hayes", "I guess, if you kind of tried to break it down between margin and mix, I\u2019d would say margin rates are relatively the same year-over-year both in new equipment and in service. But I didn\u2019t quantify when I talked earlier, but there was about two points of shift into new equipment mix in the quarter year-over-year and also first quarter to second quarter. So it was a couple of points. ", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "All right. And then if you look at Sikorsky's margins, on a year-over-year basis, incremental margins are only about 6%. Can you maybe just break out and just talk about what you're seeing from a cost performance standpoint and what would the, were there any non-recurring items in the quarter? ", "Were there any specific headwinds that you see that go away in Q3 and Q4. I know that you expect to see improving learning curve in the next couple quarters, but maybe you can just touch on the incremental margin performance? ", "And also aftermarket profits within Sikorsky, were they up year-over-year? ", "Greg Hayes", "Steve, this is Greg. As you look at Sikorsky, I would tell you last year's second quarter had a very low production rate of helicopters and so this year on a year-over-year basis, we are, we do have headwinds from also the lower margins on the Blackhawks that are going out the door. ", "The real issue at Sikorsky as we look forward is to take costs out of the supply chain. The margin this year was 7.3 here in the Q2, it was only 7% in the first quarter. And they have to make a lot more progress throughout the year on cost and it is not going to all be done this year. ", "As we look out, this is probably more like an 18-month journey to try and take costs out of the supply chain, because quite frankly we've got POs out there today that already go out in 12 to 18 months. ", "So, there's lots and lots of work to do about cost. There was nothing really significant I would tell you on a one-time basis in Sikorsky's results. It is just shipping a lot of helicopters. It\u2019s 49 helicopters, it was a big quarter. ", "Aftermarket was also very strong, margin is down a little bit in the aftermarket, but it really, it\u2019s a story about taking cost out going forward. And with a $9 billion backlog, there's lots of opportunity to take costs out. ", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "All right, then lastly, inventories. Do you expect year-end inventories in '07 to be below the first quarter level or will they be up? ", "Ken Parks", "That\u2019s a real good question. Inventory is up $1.3 billion. We were up $851 million in the first quarter. A big piece, as I mentioned, of that is Carrier and the Carrier inventories will come down as they naturally do. It goes into receivables here in the third quarter when we collect that cash. ", "But inventories is going to be a continuing problem. I think we will see inventories down from the level we see here in fourth quarter. I don\u2019t think it'll be flat with what we saw in the first, at the beginning of the year, but we do expect to make progress on inventory. ", "I've got to tell you, with Sikorsky and their backlog, it\u2019s tough. And It is not like this does not get a lot of attention. I would tell you that George and Louis are both frustrated. Louis hosts regular meetings on inventory to try and get to the bottom of this. ", "And as I have said before, it really is about high organic revenue growth driving this inventory. And it\u2019s problematic. ", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "All right, thanks a lot. ", "Ken Parks", "Thank you Steve. ", "Operator", "We'll take the next question from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. ", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. A couple of questions back at Pratt. I just want to understand a little bit better if you take the margins on a per-restructuring basis year-over-year, it looks like margins were down 17% versus 20% last year. ", "Can, Greg, you walk us through in a little more detail the puts and takes that sort of account for that? ", "Greg Hayes", "Hold on just one second. Let me take a look. ", "Ken Parks", "Margins are actually high Heidi, I will give you the numbers and then I'll let Greg talk a little bit here, which is if you adjust each set of numbers for restructuring, margins are actually up about 10 basis points in the quarter year-over-year. ", "There was a gain last year in the quarter that maybe working into your map on the collaboration settlement. If you pull that out, margins are up 10 basis points, so with that, I'll hand it over to Greg. ", "Greg Hayes", "I think that is exactly it. Last year we settled the collaboration matter. We ended up paying the government about $300 million, but there also was a benefit for that. It just popped Pratt's operating profit last year. ", "We\u2019ve adjusted all that out on the webcast slides here and in our discussions. ", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Then you have talked about the geared turbofan. You have an engine in need of a plane with the geared turbofan and Airbus' A350 plane family probably needs more engine OEs. ", "Can you talk to us about whether you're seeing any change in the odds on there being some news there or potential announcement on the Mitsubishi regional jets? ", "Greg Hayes", "I guess, let's start with the A350. I think that\u2019s a plane we would agree probably in need of a second engine. I know GE, we all know that GE has been in negotiations with Airbus over an engine for that. ", "We have also had discussions with Airbus and with our partner on the engine alliance, which is GE, on the GP7000 for that. But quite frankly, we do not see a lot of progress on the GP7000 right now. I think that will play itself out here over the next six months or so. ", "As you think about the geared turbofan, we think there are lots of opportunities out there. Obviously the key to the market is going to be the next generation single-aisle, that\u2019s Boeing and Airbus of course, but there's other opportunities. You mentioned the Mitsubishi aircraft, Bombardier is looking at aircraft, we all know about that. ", "But, our focus right now is demonstrating that the technology works. And once we've demonstrated that the technology works, I think there will be a different view from the airframers in terms of the viability of that engine because if we really do show 12% fuel burn gain on that, it will be a differentiator in the marketplace. ", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Great, and then last question, how would you describe the status of your schedule on all of Hamilton Sundstrand's deliverables on the 787 at this juncture? ", "Greg Hayes", "We would say it's all quite good. We're supporting the plane. Our equipment is there. We have supported them throughout the program and we continue to in fact build inventory and ship product to them to meet their very aggressive production ramp up schedule. ", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Are you on time? ", "Greg Hayes", "For the most part, I would say yes. We are in no way holding up that aircraft. ", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "All right, great. Thanks very much. ", "Greg Hayes", "Thank you Heidi. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs. ", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning. ", "Greg Hayes", "Hi Deane. ", "Ken Parks", "Good morning Deane. ", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "I would like to get some clarity on the change in guidance from the total company level and specifically what influence and factor for foreign exchange both on revenue and earnings. ", "Ken Parks", "Dean, why don't I take that? Foreign exchange is a benefit in the guidance for both revenues and profits, but part of that is offset, as we have talked on the last call about commodity costs, because that's related to a weaker dollar. ", "I would step back for a moment and look at the overall guidance for UTC. I think longtime followers of the company would say it's classic UTC. We expect and we deliver to you a company that performs well in the current period and is probably the most important word in this sentence, we also take goodness in the current period and invest for future periods, because we are already starting to invest in '08 and '09 now and I know that you all don't care much about those years now, but you will and one day the stock will trade off '08 and '09. ", "So, I think this is classic UTC in the guidance, which is a little bit more today and also a little bit of investment for future periods. ", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Sure. We do care about those out years, I promise you. ", "Ken Parks", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "But on that point, can you just walk us through on the incremental spending, $100 million more in R&D, some more restructuring; I think you said ERP and some more ACE investments. ", "Just give a sense of the timing of this, the magnitude, and the decision-making as to where you are going to allocate this additional spending. ", "Greg Hayes", "I think first and foremost on the E&D, it's going to go towards the new technology, which is going to be the geared turbofan. We continue to invest in the 787. We're also probably going to ramp up and spend some more on the A350 this year, especially at Hamilton. ", "Again, lots of opportunities at Pratt & Whitney as well outside of the big engine business. At Pratt Canada, they continue to have a very successful run up there. So R&D, there's lots opportunities to invest. And we take a look at all those opportunities and there's more to come. ", "I think on ACE, again, lots of opportunities. As Louis just mentioned many times, we\u2019ve got a long way to go on ACE and that takes investment, investment in people, investment in systems, to get processes under control. And at the end of the day as you improve process, you improve quality and you reduce cost. So, I would tell you ACE would be up there. ", "And you've also got ERP systems, and Carrier is a prime example. They're making an investment in SAP here in North America. It's a big investment for them this year in a very tough year, but it\u2019s for the long-term good of the business. So, lots and lots of different opportunities for investments. ", "Ken Parks", "Let me give you one other example, Deane, and that is if you look at Carrier right now, the residential market is weak and profits are down year over year. So that would be a very easy environment to say, well, we ought to cut advertising spending. But in point of fact, we've increased it over the course of the year even though the market is bad, because we have to support the brand and we'll be there when the market turns, and it will turn at some point. It may not be until '08, but we'll make investment in the brand and the market now for when it does come back. ", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Just specifically on restructuring, the timing, what's the expectations for third quarter? Is there anything, any one-timers in the third quarter we should be aware of? ", "Ken Parks", "We would expect -- we do have some restructuring actions teed up really across all the businesses. We're looking, as you'll see in our Q, at a small tax gain which will probably offset restructuring. So I think as we look at Q3, restructurings will probably equal the onetime gain. ", "Then as we look out to fourth quarter, we see more appetite for restructuring. We do not yet have visibility to other gains, but we will work those things over the next few months. And again, if there is good restructuring, we are going to do it. ", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. ", "Ken Parks", "Thanks, Deane. ", "Operator", "We will take the next question from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank. ", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. Just a quick clarification on Deane's question on restructuring. That the comment he made about restructuring being greater than gains, does that speak to the full year or do you expect the second half of the year for restructuring to be greater? ", "Greg Hayes", "I was speaking, Nigel, to the full year. And again, I just said $0.02 in excess and there maybe more, as Jim indicated, in terms of investments here later in the year. ", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "On that comment, $0.07 of drag in the first quarter, is that included in that calculation or are we just talking about here about $0.02 in the second quarter? ", "Greg Hayes", "No, we're just talking about the $0.02 here in the first quarter. ", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that's helpful. And then with Carrier, you gave us the residential decline of 5%. Can you just fill in the pieces for the other parts of the business, specifically commercial and refrigeration? ", "Jim Geisler", "Commercial actually, globally, was very strong in the quarter, up mid-teens on the revenue side. Residential international also, as I said, had a good start to the season. It was up about 10% in the quarter. ", "Refrigeration, I'm going to break apart for you a little bit, but give you the overall growth rate of high-single digit. I think it is important to think about some of those pieces of that business. You have got the stationery, refrigeration and then you've got transport refrigeration. ", "In the transport refrigeration business, both the container and the European truck trailer business were very strong. We continue to see some softness in the North America truck trailer business. And that is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Then on the stationery side, pretty consistent with what we've seen on the last couple of years, which is mid-single-digit growth on revenues. ", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Great, and you talked about the new construction channel being very weak. Can you just, quantify what that is and what would your North American residential exposure, how much of that would be newbuild? ", "Greg Hayes", "As we break out the market, what we see for the residential new construction market is that is down more than 20% year-to-date, probably more than 25% actually. AOR markets, the add-on replacement is about flat, maybe slightly up. ", "So again, as you think about carrier's business, which is hundreds of -- at least 50-50, I would say, in volume. We have been hurt more than others I would say from a market perspective. ", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and you talked about obviously the residential market surprising to the downside, but as we get to second half of the year and into 2008, do we still get negative comps or does it just flatten out? ", "Jim Geisler", "We certainly walked into the year thinking that the comps in the second half would be easier than the first because we saw the decline begin in second half of last year. Greg talked about in his comments that the look on the market in the North America, the recovery is stretching out. So comps will be definitionally easier, but the market is still not helping us much at this point in time. ", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "We will take the next question from Nicole Parent with Credit Suisse. ", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Just following up on that question, when we think about Carrier and you look at the remainder of the year, when you think about commercial global, the international residential portion, and then the break out of refrigeration, European truck trailer versus U.S., how should we think about kind of the dynamics over the remaining part of 2007? ", "Jim Geisler", "I think more of exactly what you've seen in the first half, which is strong commercial, strong international. The same dynamics within those pieces of transport and residential we're still very cautious on. ", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and I guess big picture, when we think about the non-res market, you talked about North American Otis orders. Can you compare them Q2 versus Q1, the health of kind of -- I guess big picture, international global? Can you give us a kind of growth perspective in terms of revenues U.S. versus rest of world and maybe break out by Europe and Asia? ", "Ken Parks", "Let's talk about 1Q versus 2Q to give you some flavor there. The Americas and China, I specifically said the U.S. and China, were as strong if not a little bit stronger on the order rate in the second quarter versus the first. We actually saw some tick up in the orders and sales in Korea this quarter, so that was a little bit of a difference between the second quarter and the first. As you know, that is an important market that we watch. ", "Asia overall was up in orders about 21% in the quarter. With the health of China and the up tick of Korea, that is actually a little bit better overall growth in Q1. ", "Europe, up mid-single digits. That is a healthy market in all of our businesses. We've talked about it positively on each one of our segments and those order rates are up mid-single digits, as I said before, and revenues are growing that like also. ", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you. ", "Ken Parks", "Thanks, Nicole. ", "Operator", "We will take the next question from Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Good morning, everyone. ", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning, Joe. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "I would like to start out just looking at your aero guidance for the three businesses. You raised your sales guidance for each, in some cases materially, but your operating profit growth in each case is flat with a little plus on it. We know about the commodity issues, although nickel has certainly retraced quite a bit in recent weeks, but I am wondering is it just commodities or across the businesses, or would you say it is a basket of things that is preventing you from increasing your operating profit guidance in line with your sales guidance? ", "Greg Hayes", "I think commodities certainly play a piece of this puzzles as we look out in the second half of the year. You're right, nickel has come down. It has not come down to nearly the levels we saw. I mean, it is up 5x over the last four years, so it is still very, very high. ", "When you think about it, though, the reason we're not let's say more bullish on the guidance is about the investments that we talked about. There are lots of places to invest in the aerospace side and both Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton are taking this opportunity as they've seen a little bit stronger revenues to make some further investments. ", "And Sikorsky, they will probably do little better, as we said in the guidance, but they have still got a lot of work to do on their costs. So I do not think we're ready to declare victory at Sikorsky, but we will see. We've got another six months to go and I think there's lots of opportunity there. ", "Ken Parks", "Joe, you said we put little plus after each one of the guidance numbers, but it is just a plus and it is a bump up to the guidance numbers. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, these investments that you're making, are these sort of -- these are over and above your previous plan even from last quarter? ", "Greg Hayes", "I would say that, again, there are some incremental investments that we're making in each of the businesses that we're not in the plan when we started the year. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, on the residential HVAC business, did I get the numbers right that you said that sales were down 5%, but earnings were down 30 plus? ", "Greg Hayes", "That is correct. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "And does that 30 plus factor in the $50 million hit you took because of your factory issue last year? ", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. It's actually if you think about last year, I think we said there was about $35 million of actual factory costs. There was another 15 or so of lost margin, but on a year-over-year basis, that is a fair comparison. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, so how do we think about I guess the detrimental margins there? I mean obviously that seem to be much more negative than one would normally expect. You said you would get, from a commodity cost standpoint you've got most of it back in pricing. How do we think about that? ", "Jim Geisler", "Joe, it is a pretty tough market right now and we have a much higher mix, again, towards new construction as opposed to add-on replacement and that's low margin. And we are also saying because commodity prices have flattened out a little bit, we are also seeing price pressure, particularly on the low end. ", "So all the good pricing that we had gotten, obviously that is tough to get in a market that is contracting. But we have got the good share and a good product and this market and business will turn. I think, again, we're investing right now in that for the long-term. In the meantime, we've got three businesses growing at 15% plus in the other parts of Carrier. ", "Greg Hayes", "Joe, as you think about, too, you've got to keep in mind the factory at Collierville is sized to deliver 10,000 units a day. I think Halsey Cook and the guys running the North American business have been faced with some volume shortfalls as a result of this market contraction. ", "They have shut the factory down a number of times that were not planned early in the year and we have lost a lot of absorption. So when you've got a big factory, it has got to be full. It has got to be running full-out and that is not happening right now. So that is why I think the incremental margins are as poor as they are. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Just one more. On Rentokil, are you closed that in a pretty sizable deal? What can you tell us about, I guess your intentions there with regard to restructuring because I think there is quite an overlap in your facilities and that is probably a big part of the appeal to you of the acquisition. ", "Ken Parks", "That is absolutely right. We like the Rentokil acquisition a great deal in part because it sits on our existing footprint, the branch structure and the call network. So, there are very good synergies out of the business and obviously to harness those, we've got to do some restructuring. I think you'll find most of it to be in purchase accounting, but some will be branch closures of our pre-existing facilities and offices. So you'll see little bit of the restructuring comes to the P&L. That is what Greg talked about when we have an investment in the business. You'll see that over the next couple quarters. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "So from a net standpoint, though, we should not expect much net benefit the back half of the year, I guess, because you are going to be spending to save. But next year, we should definitely start to see some of the benefits? ", "Greg Hayes", "In fact, if you remember last quarter we actually took up Fire & Security's guidance to 125 because of the benefit we're going to see from the Rentokil acquisition. Most of that of course gets absorbed by higher interest costs below the line, but certainly within their business, they are going to see incremental margins for this business this year. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Right, I just meant from a pure cost-savings standpoint. When do you start to see really hit the net cost savings hit the operating profit line? ", "Ken Parks", "We start on those actions today, but you see most of the benefit 12 to 18 months out. ", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Alright, thank you, everyone. ", "Operator", "Next to George Shapiro with Citi. ", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Good morning. ", " Greg Hayes ", "Hi, George! ", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Let me just follow-up a little bit on the Carrier. So at this point, the commercial -- have the commercial margins at Carrier gotten up to at least the high-single digits? ", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. ", "Ken Parks", "Yes. ", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "And would the residential margins now this quarter be below the commercial margins? ", "Ken Parks", "Tough quarter and the answer is yes. ", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Okay. And then if I switch back to Pratt & Whitney for a minute, in the aftermarket growth of 15%, could you break that into how much was actually spare versus overhaul and repair? ", "Greg Hayes", "Spares were essentially flat on year-over-year basis. You'll recall, George, we had a very tough -- had a very strong '02 -- I am sorry -- second quarter '06, so the compares are very tough. But spares remain just about even with last year. The real benefit has come on the volume side. As I said before, we're seeing a lot more engines come through the shop and we're seeing 20%-plus growth on the services side. ", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Okay, but that would have somewhat of a negative impact on the margin because you're not making nearly as much on the O&H business as you are on the outright spares. ", "Greg Hayes", "Absolutely. I think as you look at Pratt's margins, revenues this quarter are up over $3 billion. We did get 10 basis point of margin expansion, but the two pieces of the business that are growing fastest, which is the aftermarket services, are not the high margin business like the spares. You've got power, which again, very solid revenue growth, but relatively lower margins. ", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "And did you make any deliveries to Airbus for the 380 this quarter? Because I would think if you did, those engines probably have even bigger losses than the average engine. ", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, there was actually four engines that got delivered this quarter. ", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "And what\u2019s the outlook for how many you'll do the rest of the year? ", "Jim Geisler", "We're targeting probably about twice that many for the year. ", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Okay. Okay, that's good. That's my questions. ", "Greg Hayes", "Thank you, George. ", "Operator", "Next Myles Walton with CIBC World Markets. ", "Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets", "Thanks. Good morning. ", "Greg Hayes", "Hi, Walton! ", "Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets", "We haven\u2019t talked about pension in a while, probably a good thing, but I think the Company's expense this year will be down on absolute basis maybe $140 million year-over-year. Is that about right? ", "Greg Hayes", "No, it is not quite that much. I think it is -- are we talking this year? It is down, but it is less than $100 million. ", "Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets", "Okay, and which of the segment is that helping the most? ", "Greg Hayes", "Well, I think you're seeing a benefit in Fire & Security. They are getting a little bit of pension good news. You're also seeing it really at the aero businesses, because they are the big U.S. employers. ", "Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets", "Okay, and hard to predict, but going into next year a similar if not better compare on pension, given prior year losses rolling off? ", "Greg Hayes", "I think that is fair. We will get a little bit of tailwind out of pensions. It is a little early to focus on '08, but I think if you do the math, you are going to see little bit of good news there. ", "Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets", "Alright, that's great. And then can you just quantify the R&D increases at Pratt and Hamilton year-over-year in the quarter? ", "Jim Geisler", "Yes. UTC overall was up about $47 million, $48 million in the quarter. Both Pratt and Hamilton were up $14 million, $15 million, so they were the biggest pieces of that change. ", "Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets", "Are they also the recipients of the $50 million increase in the quarter of the guidance for R&D for the year? ", "Jim Geisler", "Yes, aerospace businesses, yes. ", "Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets", "Okay great, and then just one last one. If you look at the slides in the presentation, last quarter you did have the aero supply chain as a concern. You did not have it is a concern with this quarter. Is that -- from your comments it certainly sounds like that is still a very serious watch area, but was there anything in the way of risk retired in the quarter that motivated taking off the list? ", "Greg Hayes", "I would tell you it is getting a little bit more predictable, if not better, and I think that\u2019s why we have taken it off. It is still a problem out there. It is hurting us at an inventory standpoint. It is hurting us from a delivery standpoint. But, I think, again, things have started to settle down the supply chain. It is just not getting better, so I would say, it is not under control, but from where we sit, I think we see the light at the end of the tunnel. It is going to be another 12 months before we really see any big changes there. ", "Myles Walton - CIBC World Markets", "Alright, that is helpful. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. ", " Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Yes. Thanks a awful lot guys. ", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks Cai. ", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Sikorsky, you did 49 deliveries. You talk about 170 for the year. That implies you do less in Q3 and Q4 than Q2. Is that what you're looking for? Is that a conservative number? ", "Greg Hayes", "That is the way the math works, you're absolutely right. We have done 85 helicopters year-to-date. The thing you should focus on, too, you'll notice there was a lot of commercial helicopters here in Q2. ", "The mix actually goes against us in terms of the number of hours as we start building the new Blackhawks. Those are much more hour-intensive down in the factory, so assembly hours will be up and so production will be down a little bit, but can Jeff do more than 170? Perhaps, but I think we're all comfortable with 170 helicopters right now. ", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay, and if we look at Pratt, you did 98 commercial engines, so you're up two. But you're still kind of down year-over-year in kind of a booming market. Are we looking -- particularly I am thinking about the V2500 likely to move up? Do you still expect engines to move large commercial up for the year? Was this quarter restrained by supplier issues, because that number looks a little lighter than I thought it might be? ", "Greg Hayes", "It's actually -- I think if you take a look at I, Cai, it's much better what we did in the first quarter where, I tell you, the supply chain issues were even worse. Supply chain did not really constrain us here in Q2. I think, for the year we are still comfortable engines are going to be -- are going to be up and especially at Pratt Canada, they're going to be up substantially. ", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "If they're going to be up, you are going to have pretty good sequential gains in the third and fourth quarter in large commercial. ", "Greg Hayes", "I think that is absolutely true on the revenue side. You will see higher sales there. ", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay and the last one was you had mentioned you raised the R&D guidance and Sikorsky -- excuse me, Hamilton Sundstrand was up $15 million year-over-year. To get to your new number, it looks like R&D has got to run at about that $420 million you did in the quarter, in both the third and the fourth. I would think that Ham Sundstrand would start to come down given the huge balloon you have in the second quarter on the 787. Is that correct or --? ", "Greg Hayes", "I think, you're absolutely right, Cai, that on the 787 program, the spending will start to trend down here in the second half of the year, but that\u2019s about the first flight. Once that happens, people will start rolling off. In fact, we have already started rolling down the spending here little bit in Q2 as we have delivered all the hardware. ", "But as I mentioned, there's lots of other places that Hamilton is making investments. Specifically on the A350, it looks to be a lot of content, perhaps not as much as we saw in the 787, but there's lots of appetite from Airbus to engage Hamilton on that program. ", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Excellent, thank you very much. ", "Greg Hayes", "Thank you very much. ", "Ken Parks", "Thanks Cai. Okay, Amy, why don\u2019t we take our last question. ", "Operator", "Okay and the final question come from Chris Kotowicz with A.G. Edwards. ", "Chris Kotowicz - A.G. Edwards", "Hey, good morning guys. ", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning Chris. ", "Chris Kotowicz - A.G. Edwards", "Maybe just a couple things. Are you seeing any indication -- and maybe I missed this -- but are you seeing any indication that nonresidential construction is going to slowdown in North America over the next 12 months? It sounds like things are good, but \u2013 ", "Greg Hayes", "We have not, especially in those markets where we are very, very strong -- in the hospitality side, very strong and more than 40% orders growth at Otis. I think it is just a testament to how strong the market really is. ", "Chris Kotowicz - A.G. Edwards", "Would you say it is accelerating outside of North America? Everything we are hearing is that Europe and the Middle East in particular are really good. Are you seeing it that way or is it just steady, but really good? ", "Greg Hayes", "Steady but really good. I would tell you Europe, again steady. Asia, especially China, very, very strong. We mentioned 50% -- 40% kind of order growth rate in China, so no slowdown there. In Europe and rest of world really still really very strong. ", "Chris Kotowicz - A.G. Edwards", "Okay, and then switching to power, I don\u2019t recall hearing anything real specific about unit shipments on the swift and twin packs. Can you advise us how many unit shipments you had in the quarter? ", "Jim Geisler", "We shipped about -- we shipped actually 10 units in the quarter combined of all the power units. ", "Chris Kotowicz - A.G. Edwards", "Okay, and from an outlook standpoint, it sounds like that\u2019s probably going to pick up. Can you add some commentary on how you see the market evolving? ", "Greg Hayes", "I think at least for the remainder of this year we see a very strong market in power, a little bit slower perhaps next year. But I think Pratt Power has actually benefit for the availability of the machines and they have been able to capitalize on what is a very strong market out there, so I do not want to comment too much on '08, but I would tell you at least for the last half of '07, that should continue to be pretty strong at Pratt. ", "Chris Kotowicz - A.G. Edwards", "Strong meaning better than 10 a quarter? ", "Jim Geisler", "Yes. ", "Chris Kotowicz - A.G. Edwards", "Okay, and then just some housekeeping. What's your current foreign exchange assumption on dollar to euro? ", "Greg Hayes", "We have just done at spot, which is about $1.36 when we put this together. ", "Chris Kotowicz - A.G. Edwards", "Okay, thanks guys. ", "Greg Hayes", "Okay, thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate your time and attention this morning.

Morgan", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the United Technology's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Vice President, Accounting and Finance; Jim Geisler, Vice President, Finance; and Ken Parks, Director of Investor Relations.", "This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's homepage at www.utc.com. The company reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thank you Rufus and good morning, everyone. As you saw the press release this morning, UTC ended 2007 with a strong fourth quarter with each of our six business units delivering double-digit earnings growth and exceptionally good cash flow. More revenues of the UTC operating model with its focus on top line growth, margin expansion and cash generation delivers consistently for shareholders.", "And it is that operating model along with a strong management team that gives us confidence of another good year in 2008 despite the economic headwinds that we read about everyday. I\u2019ll let Ken take you through the Q4 detail in just a minute, but let me just hit a couple of the highlights of the quarter.", "In the fourth quarter, earnings per share were $1.08. That's up 24% over last year. Revenues were up 15%, including 8% organic growth. That follows 10% organic growth in Q1, 10% in Q2 and 9% in Q3. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion or 150% of net income. It was driven by working capital reductions, primarily inventory reductions of a little over $500 million as well as solid collections. Included in the fourth quarter results is a net $0.04 a share charge driven by non-U.S. tax law changes, restructuring and a few other one-time items and Ken will take you through those details in just a minute. But no surprises here, as this net $0.04 impact is consistent with what we told you back in the fourth quarter and third quarter conference call.", "As we look across the businesses, we see continued examples of solid execution, a very good top line growth at the aero units, strong margin expansion at Sikorsky and Fire & Security, a solid operating performance, performance at Otis and at Carrier, and despite of the significant drag in the U.S. housing market. We had a major milestone in the quarter as well with Geared Turbofan, which successfully completed almost 70 hours of ground testing, demonstrating about the validity and robustness of the engine's design. The rollout of ACE UTC's operating system continues, ending the year with 30% of sites at gold or silver level, nearly doubled from the beginning of the year. Our goal remains 70% by 2009. ACE is a proven operating system with a rigorous focus on the customer and process. These provide benefits not just in the factory but in all the customer-facing and back office functions that can drive value creation across the company. So, strong finish to 2007, that more importantly underscores the importance and success of operational excellence at UTC. And it\u2019s this operational excellence that gives us confidence that 2008 would be another good year for UTC. I will come back and talk a little bit more about the outlook for '08 at the end. But first let me hand it over to Ken to take you through the details.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you Greg. And as Greg said fourth quarter earnings per share were a $1.08, less than 24% over the last year including $0.04 of restructuring and charges in excess of gains. Recall that last year's fourth quarter included $0.05 of restructuring in excess of gains. Now let me go through the non-recurring items in the quarter as shown, the sale of two non-core businesses generated $83 million of gains. In addition to restructuring charges, following $63 million we settled the litigation matter at Carrier. Finally, our effective tax rate in the quarter was higher primarily as a result of non-U.S. tax law changes. As you recall, we had $0.04 of net gains in our third quarter results and told you to expect the same amount of net charges in the fourth quarter.", "As tax accounted for 5 points of our revenue growth and 2 points of our EPS growth, as the 4Q average Euro rate of $1.45 was significantly higher than last year's average rate of $1.27 and consistent with our assumption for 2008.", "Moving on to page four and turning to the business unit details, I\u2019ll remind you that I will talk to segment results adjusted for restructuring and these non-recurring items that I just went through. Otis finished the year with a strong fourth quarter. Profits up 22% on revenue growth of 17%, revenues grew in all geographic regions including double-digit growth in Asia and North America as Otis continues to execute on a robust new equipment backlog. While revenue mix continued to shift towards new equipment, margins expanded by 60 basis points by 18.9%. Favorable foreign exchange contributed just under half of the revenue and profit growth in the quarter. New equipment orders remained strong in the fourth quarter with an increase of 20%.", "For the year, Otis delivered a 15% increase in operating profit on 14% revenue growth. Margins expanded to 19%, a 20 basis point improvement as ongoing cost containment and efficiency action mitigated commodity and labor cost headwinds, continued pricing pressures and the shift in Otis revenue towards more new equipment. Favorable foreign exchange contributed approximately 40% of the revenue growth and 45% of the profit growth. Otis ended the year with a new equipment backlog 27% higher than the prior year. The robust new equipment backlog positions 2008 to be another good year for Otis with guidance of high single digit revenue growth and profit growth of 10% or more.", "At Carrier, fourth quarter operating profit increased 20% year-over-year on 14% higher revenues, translating into 30 basis points of margin expansion. As in recent quarters, strength in the building systems, international, residential and light commercial, and refrigeration businesses more than offset housing-related weakness in North America.", "Favorable foreign exchange contributed about six points to revenue growth and about half of the earnings growth slightly exceeding the net commodity headwind in the quarter. For the year, Carrier earnings grew 12% on 9% higher revenues, margins expanded 20 basis points to 9.5%.", "Earnings growth was consistent with our initial guidance despite a continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market, while currency translation contributed about $50 million of the earnings growth, it was more than offset by net commodity headwind of about $80 million. We continue to expect Carrier to grow earnings by at least 10% on mid-single digit revenue growth in 2008.", "UTC Fire & Security continued its strong performance as revenue growth of 27%, generated profit growth of 38% in the quarter. Revenue growth was substantially driven by acquisitions as well as 9 points of favorable foreign exchange. Foreign exchange also added about 10 points of the profit growth.", "Continuing benefits from previously announced restructuring actions as well as ongoing pricing and supply chain initiatives resulted in margin improvement of 80 basis points year-over-year. In December, we completed the purchase of Rentokil's Initial Electronic Security Group as we closed on our French piece of the business. This followed our acquisition of the U.K., Netherlands and U.S. businesses in the third quarter.", "Fire & Security delivered full-year profit growth of 40% on revenue increase of 21% resulting in margin improvement of 110-basis points for the year.", "For 2008, Fire & Security will continue to focus on margin expansion and profitable revenue growth. We expect revenues will grow mid-single digits with operating profit growth of 25%.", "Now turning to the aerospace businesses, Pratt & Whitney revenues increased to $172 million or 6% in the quarter led by 20% growth at Pratt & Whitney, Canada and 80% growth at Power Systems.", "Operating profit improved 16% in the quarter reflecting the higher revenues, the absence of unfavorable adjustments in last year's fourth quarter and the favorable impact on completion of contractual milestones on a commercial engine program. Partially offsetting this growth were higher commodity and R&D costs, which each negatively impacted fourth quarter operating margins. For the full year, Pratt & Whitney increased operating profit 14% on revenue growth of 9% driven primarily by Pratt & Whitney Canada, a large commercial engine asset market and Power Systems. We anticipate the solid performance at Pratt to continue into 2008 expecting mid-single digit revenue growth with operating profit growth of approximately $175 million to $200 million depending on the GTF program. Spending on the GTF will approach $125 million, which is about 60% of UTC's total expected E&D increase of $200 million in 2008.", "In the quarter, Hamilton Sundstrand revenues grew 15% with operating profit growth of 12%. Similar to recent quarters, performance was solid in the aerospace aftermarket and industrial segments, both delivering double-digit revenue and operating profit growth.", "R&D investments principally on the 787 program continued to be a headwind, accounting for more than 100 basis points of operating margin in both the quarter and the year. Even with these investments, Hamilton delivered a solid year with revenue growth of 13%, profit growth of 14% and 10 basis points of operating margin expansion. For 2008, we continue to expect Hamilton revenues to grow at high single-digit rates and operating profit to increase 10%.", "Revenues at Sikorsky grew 18% in the quarter as they continue to increase production to deliver the record helicopter backlog. Operating profit grew about 80% over last year's fourth quarter and was up sequentially from the third, in line with our guidance of sequential profit growth each quarter around [ph] 2007.", "Sikorsky operating profit for the year was $370 million as compared to our guidance a year ago of $340 million. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped 46 large helicopters, 22 military and 24 commercial.

Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Okay, thanks Ken. Before turning to the 2008, just a few final thoughts on 2007. It was another strong year of both revenue and earnings growth for UTC. Revenues for the year ended at just under $55 billion and that's up 14% from 2006, and the full 9% of that growth organic. It is the fourth consecutive year of solid organic growth coming on top of 9% organic growth in '06, 7% in 2005 and 8% in 2004. Earnings per share for the full-year were $4.27, that's up 15% over 2006. This is also the fourth consecutive year of solid double-digit EPS growth following 19% in '06, 18% in '05 and 19% in 2004. And don't forget that the 2000 EPS includes a net $0.07 drag associated with the resolution of the Otis EU matter back in the first quarter.", "Free cash flow for the year ended at essentially 100% of net income, [inaudible] growth of 1.4 billion and the headwind of the Otis EU and Canadian tax payments back in the first quarter, which totaled almost $0.5 billion.", "Although we saw significant improvement of working capital throughout the year, inventory and more specifically inventory returns was disappointing. No is the answer here, but we can fix this through focus and by continuing to use the ACE tools in our own factories as well as at our suppliers to improve inventory velocity across the entire supply chain. On perhaps a happier note, in 2007 we returned 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends, the second consecutive year, which we returned over $3 billion of free cash flow to shareholders. Acquisition spending, including acquired debt for the full-year was $2.3 billion, slightly higher than our guidance for the year. A full $1.8 billion of this spending was allocated to our Fire & Security business as we continue to build the scale in our newest segments. So another excellent quarter and year for UTC, double digit earnings growth across all of our business, robust organic revenue growth and solid cash flow generation. And just as importantly, solid execution by our experienced management team, all of which gives us confidence as we look towards 2008.", "On 2008 first of all, no changes from what we told you in December. Although 2008 may be a tougher economic environment, we continue to see another year, solid year ahead given UTC's geographic balance, a continued worldwide infrastructure build-out, our emerging market presence and our solid execution capability. On emerging markets, we expect these markets to continue to expand at roughly 2x those of the developed markets, albeit not clear to the pace we've seen over the last few years.", "Commercial aerospace OEM markets remained strong, due to continuing growth in revenue passenger miles worldwide and in spite of record-high fuel prices. We currently see good order and quota activity in our commercial construction markets, however, we remain alert to the impact of the credit crisis and its essential spillover impact on these markets. And although the North American residential market remains sluggish, it still represents only 5% with overall UTC revenues, balance those work.", "Overall, the strengths of macroeconomic certainly on the horizon, we are confident in our ability to once again deliver strong results that our investors have come to expect from UTC. For the year we see revenues of approximately $59 billion on mid single-digit organic growth consistent with what we said in December and we expect EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.85 and free cash flow to equal or exceed net income, our usual standard.", "So with that, let me open up the call to questions. Rufus?", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you Sir. Ladies and gentlemen our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And for our first question we go to Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hello Heidi. Good morning.", "Operator", "Ms. Wood your line is open please go ahead.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Okay sorry...there was some problem. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you are seeing in commercial aftermarket? How much did they grow in 2007 and what are you expecting in 2008? I'm just wondering if you can give an update on what are the most recent trends you're seeing there?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think, Heidi, as we look across the business, what we saw, it was very, very strong aftermarket growth at Hamilton, 20% kind of growth. Pratt & Whitney actually had a... for fourth quarter that was a little bit flattish again coming off of a very strong compare. And Sirkosky, which it's rolled up and is actually was down just a little bit off of very strong deliveries back in 2006. But I think the overall trends we see remain very, very strong and we would expect high single-digit kind of growth in the aftermarket for 2008. Our RPMs continued strong, yields are very good at the airlines. And despite these record high oil prices, people are still flying out there. So we don't see any slowdown especially as the OEMs continue this build out of the record backlog.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "All right thank you, and then on Carrier how much was North American residential down in 2007 and tell us what you're expecting in 2008?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "The market for North America was down for systems a little bit more than 10% and remember that's a mix of residential new construction, as well as AOR. So, you\u2019ve got the\u2026 residential construction piece was [inaudible] based on housing starts down more than 20%, probably closer to 25%. AOR was a little bit better than that and probably closer to just right at double digits down. Rents followed along with that. As you know, we talked earlier in the year that we had lost a couple of points in market share in the second quarter and we basically held that position through the remainder of the year. So, that's kind of a look at '07. One we are expecting for '08, when we look at housing starts like you guys do and we are still saying a number of that looks like another 24%, 25% drop in '08, maybe AOR is a little bit better than this year, but we are really just counting on a market that continues to be down year-over-year and probably doesn't start to show any favorable comparison on a quarterly basis until we get very late in the year or probably even into early '09.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "All right. Great. Thanks so much.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Heidi.", "Operator", "We go next to Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Good morning, Deane.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "I can hear you expand, if you could, on your comments on commercial construction. And very specific, it looks like you are entering '08 with pretty sizable backlog. So, could you touch on the backlog and true up the numbers? You said Otis at one time was 18 months of backlog and Carrier around six months. So how do those backlogs look? Any risk and what has been the code activity in those businesses?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes, Deane, this is Greg. If you look at the backlog at Otis, Otis is going to end the year with about $14 billion backlog. That's up about $2.5 billion over last year. Otis continues to see very, very strong activity, especially in North America but even in Asia. In North America, we had about 30% order growth here in the fourth quarter and even in Asia it was 20%. Europe was even kind of I think mid single digits to high single digits. So, strong order growth around the entire geography for Otis. So, backlog is strong there. And you think about, that it is a little over a year sort of the sales at Otis. But it\u2019s actually more than that because of the service element. And at Carrier, at the end of the year, a little over $2 billion of backlog, that's up a little more than 10% year-over-year. And I would tell you that the code activity at Carrier also remains fairly strong. We have not seen yet a slowdown in any of the commercial construction markets that would give us an indication that we are going to see a big problem here, at least in the first half of the year.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Greg, did I hear in your prepared remarks you mentioned pricing pressure at Otis and has that changed at the margin and what does that look like for '08?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "No, I think if you think about pricing pressure, really is in China specifically, it was comment. North America pricing looks actually fairly robust, but the pricing pressure in China will continue. I think it has been world's biggest elevator market, but it is the world's biggest elevator market, lots of competition and we don't expect that the pricing pressure will oblate any time soon.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks, Deane.", "Operator", "We go next to Steve Binder with Bear Stearns.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "Yeah, Greg, you touched on the fact that there is no change in December 13\u2026 in the guidance from December 13. I am just wondering if you look at your short cycle, long cycle, more short cycle commercial end markets, and not just the short cycle business, but also long cycle at Otis, you obviously had some front-end signals. I am just wondering over the last month, month and a half you seasonally adjusted for, have you seen any real change in those end markets?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Steve, we really have not and believe me we are asking that question every week, because as we read the headlines I think everybody is concerned that there is a slowdown out there. We have not seen it. And I think that's the best news that we can convey to everyone.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "Right. And secondly with respect to R&D, obviously Pratt is a big chunk of the increase in '08, just wondering given the uncertainty of that consolidation the economy in North America in the air line business, since one of your large customers potentially is the U.S. Airline, it has been talked about. Coupled just with global concern, can you see a possibility in '08 whether that $200 million number turns out to be high and just discuss the [inaudible] of 787 could be a headwind obviously relative to that plan, but is there a chance of $200 million comes in wider than that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Maybe just to dissect that $200 million for you, we think $100 million to $125 million of that spending is going to be at Pratt & Whitney. And that is primarily going to be on the GTF. And I don't see anyway that that is going to slow down or update in any way during the course of the year. It\u2019s... we are committed to those programs, we're committed to the flight test in the middle of the year. We are still looking for partners. Obviously we have signed up one partner for 15% that is MTU. We are working with other partners. But I think the 125 or so at Pratt is pretty solid. The rest of the increase in spending is really about 30 million at Carrier, about the same amount at Otis and the same amount at Sikorsky. If you think about the 787 program specifically at Hamilton we are actually going to see a little bit of a decrease in spending, although it\u2019s certainly not at what we had hoped in the middle of last year, given the way the schedules looked at Boeing. I think there is always risk on the 787 as the programs continues to slide, but right now we actually see a little bit of good news coming out of Hamilton on the E&D line.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "And lastly, Fire & Security I mean the growth rate\u2026 the organic growth rate spending was lighter than it has been first nine months of the year. Is that just comparisons, tougher comparisons, any change in their environment?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Steve, this is Jim. The organic revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter was lowish, but I think it goes back to the base premise that our focus is on margin. I will give you the example of that. If you look into Europe, in securing Europe in this quarter we had a slight decline in organic revenue growth, but that's also where we have done the Initial Rentokil acquisition. And so the focus of the organization has been in driving margins and getting synergies out of the deal because their maintenance, their call centers and their branches sit right on top of ours. So, we continue to drive the cost reduction and sometimes that has resulted in revenue growth that's not very high. But, I think as the business gets its cost base in line then you will see revenue start to move up.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "All right. Thank you.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Joe Campbell with Lehman Brothers.", "Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers", "Hi. Good morning. There has been a lot of talk about whether the international markets and the emerging markets are coupled. They are not coupled with but perceived a real weakness in the U.S. economy. And I wondered if would just kind of walk around the various overseas UTC businesses and comment on how you see them. You mentioned, you see the developed... the emerging markets running twice the developed markets, but maybe just kind of walk around and then if you could just give us the kind of year end FX numbers for each of the businesses. You gave it for fourth quarter and I know you have given them to us over the course of the year, but just perhaps remind us of the overall contribution of FX to the businesses. Thanks very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Okay Joe, well, it can\u2019t be to FX numbers as I try to address the first part of your question. And as we look around the world, specifically Asia, I think what we would tell you is that the trends that are driving growth in Asia do not look to slow down in the near term. And that is really the continued migration of people from the farms to the factories. 17 million people a year coming in China from the farms to the factories, 30 million people across Asia and then it is driving the infrastructure build up. And we don't see anything that's really going to slow that down in the near-term. Urbanization, it's a powerful force and this was driving the business really for the last five years and driving organic growth at Otis and Carrier, as well as in the aerospace business as we've seen record orders in India and China for new aircraft. So, Asia looks to remain solid. I think Europe, the question there is what happens is the\u2026 with the Euro at 144 or 145, we have not seen any particular slowdown in Europe. It certainly is not going to have the kind of growth rates that Asia does, but we would expect that it still has kind of mid single-digit growth in 2008. In North America, again I think you got to go back to the individual businesses, res, as Ken said, it's going to be a tough market this year, we think the market for new home construction could be down 25%, but residential... I am sorry non-residential construction we still think... it may moderate a little bit from last year's growth, it's still fairly strong. And of course, the aero businesses, I think, all remain strong. And both Boeing and Airbus have record backlogs. Sikorsky has got a great backlog, they're going to build over 200 helicopters this year and you're going to see strong revenue growth out of Sikorsky. So, we don't see any big bumps on the horizon here.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Maybe one other comment on that Joe, just to offer a little bit of perspective and that is I think as Greg said, we haven't seen any slowdowns. However, we are very cognizant that other things are happening in other sectors that may come to effect in our markets. So, while we haven't seen anything yet we have to open our minds to the fact that something in time may come to affect our businesses. All that being said, we feel very good about our positions, 62% of the revenues outside the States really great mix of short and long cycle businesses and frankly company that has performed well in adverse times.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "All right Joe let me give you the FX numbers that you were asking about. For the year, for UTC overall, it contributed a couple of points of the EPS. Now the main place where it plays obviously is on the commercial side of business. So, Otis, their profit growth for the year it contributed about 7 points of growth. For Carrier, it's around 4 and Fire & Security is around 9, aero business is a small number. But all that sum together will give you a couple of points of EPS growth for UTC.", "Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you very much.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thanks Joe.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks Joe.", "Operator", "Our next question, we go to George Shapiro with Citi.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Good morning George.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "George?", "Operator", "One moment please. Mr. Shapiro, would you please resignal?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Rufus while we are waiting, is there someone we can go next on the list and then come back to George.", "Operator", "Mr. Shapiro, your line is open.", "George Shapiro - CitiGroup", "Okay.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Good morning George.", "George Shapiro - CitiGroup", "Okay. I don't know what happened but my question is given that this is the second quarter in a row that we've seen like zero spares growth at Pratt and 20% this quarter and 15% last quarter at Hamilton Sundstrand. Have you gone back and looked at why the discrepancy is so large, I mean does it relate to lack of narrow body share at Carrier versus Hamilton or what did you come up with?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think actually we have obviously taken a look at this because it's not\u2026 it is unusual I would say for there to be such a divergence between the quarter growth rate at Hamilton Sundstrand versus Pratt & Whitney. But, as we look at Pratt & Whitney, we saw a fairly big increase in inductions into the engine shop, about a 9% increase into the overhaul shop. We didn't get all of those engines out and I think had we actually seen that kind of... or had we really get those engines out, we would have seen probably much better growth in spare part because obviously the big part of the revenue there is spares. Also you pointed the fact that Hamilton is on every aircraft out there. So obviously they have a larger base on which to grow but I don't think there is anything that would tell us that Pratt is going to grow anymore slowly than Hamilton over the long-term in terms of its installed based for aftermarket.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "And remember one other thing we talked about George, as we moved through 2006 was that spare parts and aftermarket ramps up as we move throughout the year based on airline profitability and so we saw some tougher compares on the second half. Just to supplement a little bit what Greg was saying was, compared to the second half of this year, have been awfully tough compared to the second half of last year.", "George Shapiro - CitiGroup", "So why would it be that much tougher at Pratt and Hamilton?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "It\u2019s just based upon the timing of how the engines come out.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think it really goes back to the engine inductions. I think also to look back at 2006, there was a little bit of an influx of engines as we completed some of the ring casework on the Pratt 4000. So that drilled a little bit of the timing here, but in long-term we do not see a divergence in order rates.", "George Shapiro - CitiGroup", "Okay. Then Ken, could you just provide deliveries or if you wanted to do it offline I will wait for offline at Pratt?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "I can give you deliveries while we are here. Commercial engine shipments in the fourth quarter were 111, military were 40, Pratt Canada was 922 and industrial were 19.", "George Shapiro - CitiGroup", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Operator", "For our next question we go to Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Yes. Like many other companies you have good results, you haven't seen any slowdown and yet the markets continue to tank. You're sitting there with very good financial position, how do you react with that financial firepower? At what point do you go into the market and buy in your own shares, at what point do you say, now I'm going to make another acquisition?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Cai, this is Jim. We agree the stock is practically trough price right now and we already committed to $2 billion of share repurchase. So we look to buy, we will continue to look to buy and frankly while the stock is very attractively priced for us, there may be other opportunities as well. So again, I mentioned earlier, that this is an environment, I think where UTC typically does well and may have the opportunity to take advantage where others cannot take advantage. So stay tuned.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "So what you're telling me is that you're more likely to get kind of redeploy cash if we see... what we see in the last couple of weeks we are more likely to see you take more aggressive initiatives either in terms of M&A or share repurchase than you did in the fourth quarter?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "I would say right now we feel very good about having a strong balance sheet and the opportunity it gives us.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay, terrific. And just one follow up to George. Could you give us the split at Pratt in terms of year-over-year change in large engine spares and large engines MRO and at Pratt Canada?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well I think we would\u2026 we don't typically give the spares changes but I'll tell you that the book-to-bill in the quarter was right around one. As Pratt Canada growth we quoted as about 20% and that business has had good growth both on the OEM and aftermarket side, I think it's fairly comparable.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay, terrific thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks Cai.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We go next to Ronald Epstein with Merrill Lynch.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning guys.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Good morning Ron.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Good morning Ron.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "When we think about the GTF program, what milestone should we be looking for, when we look out over the next 12 months?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think the key milestone is we have gotten past the full power testing of the ground run here in the fourth quarter. The next key milestone we are going to be talking about is flight test, which will happen in mid-year. I think the other milestones, keep in mind, the actual launch of both Mitsubishi and the Bombardier CSeries aircraft. Those are still not officially launched yet. But those will be big milestones for us because that is when the spending will begin to ramp up on those programs.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "And you are spending on those programs is by continuing on some sales figure of those programs right? I mean it doesn't... Mitsubishi has to sell certain number of airplanes before you guys?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "There are certain launch conditions obviously in both contracts. So, we have to be satisfied that we have a good customer base, that's going to be a successful launch. But we are confident about Mitsubishi and the Bombardier are going to get those commitments from customers.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just a financial question. If you look at the run-rate of CapEx in the first three quarters of the year and then in the fourth quarter, fourth quarter was kind of well above trend. Why was that?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "It was concentrated more at Sikorsky and at Pratt and I think that just comes along with the fact that the capital cycle tends to be heavier in the fourth quarter of the year.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "It\u2019s really related to volumes. So, you think about Sikorsky is there is continuing ramp up the volume down in Stratford, as well as at some of the supply base as well as at Pratt Canada as we are ramping up volume on the small engines. We shipped almost 3000 engines out of Pratt Canada, this year and that obviously is going to take more capital as we continue to increase the volumes of theirs, so a little bit higher than we would have expected but still in line with what we are seeing in terms of revenue growth in those businesses.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay and then just one last quick question. Otis aftermarket in China, what kind of conversion are you are seeing from the OE equipment you have put in place to the aftermarket?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "I think it hasn't changed significantly since we talked last. We are seeing conversion. There is a long pathway. With that conversion rates in the team, I mean it\u2019s not high yet.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "We have talked about this a lot. The fact is that we do not have a large service portfolio yet in China but it gives the opportunity as we look forward as all of these elevators that we are delivering in, probably delivered more than 50,000 elevators in 2008 in China. It will eventually be a huge market for service and we would expect it over the long-term that the service portfolio would generate more than half of the revenue in China as it does throughout the rest of the Otis world.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We go next to Nicole Parent with credit Suisse.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hi Nicole.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "And just one follow-up on M&A. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of what you're seeing with the private equity bid gone and you're seeing a lot more favorable pricing and then I guess maybe a little bit more granularity when you look at the portfolio. Should we expect bolt-ons or are there any large thing for unrelated new businesses that might be of interest given where prices are?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Private equity is not very active in the M&A markets right now. I don\u2019t think I am talking anything new by restating that. But we still see that price can be a little bit sticky. So people remember what their price was three or six months ago as opposed to what it is exactly today and strategy is to have money. But all that being said, I think, over time prices will reset and again there may be opportunity for us that wouldn't be possible or available to others. Where we grow, we will look everywhere. But I think last year was a good indicator that there is good opportunity in Fire & Security and you will continue to see acquisitions there for sure.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Great. And then Greg, could you elaborate on A, which businesses had the biggest contribution in the improvement in silver and gold in '07 and what do you view as the biggest opportunity in '08?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I will start with biggest opportunity. I would say that the business that is probably further behind because it is the newest business is Fire & Security, which only has about 10% of its businesses at silver and gold today. And I think Bill Brown and the team are focused to drive that business to higher returns through the implementation of ACE. So, that will be a key. We also saw a good growth at Sikorsky and also at Carrier during the year. Pratt is of course I think farthest along. We've talked about that, but Sikorsky is quickly catching up and I think you see that in their results where they've got the fairly strong margin expansion here in the quarter. And we are going to see more of that next year.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Nicole.", "Operator", "And we go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you.

Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hi, Howard.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Good morning, Howard.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Will this be the last quarter we hear that commodity headwinds have bothered the business and how fast do you think you can take advantage of lower commodity prices?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "If we could actually accurately forecast commodity prices we would probably be doing something else. The fact is, commodities have mitigated considerably. We only saw about $40 million of headwind here in the fourth quarter. A big piece of that at Pratt and a little bit less at Carrier. As we look at the market today, obviously copper looks to be at a price much lower, not much, 10%, 15% lower than what our average price was for 2007. And some of the specialty metals, the titaniums, the nickels, those have really moderated from what we saw in the middle of last year. So, I think we will se some opportunity there if they continue down, but again I think we are not ready to call the market in terms of where commodity prices are going.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "So, you\u2019ve left unhedged a fair amount of your copper exposures?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yeah, we in fact are not hedging any of the copper exposure today.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "To follow up on a separate issue, what did... what were the two businesses you sold at Otis and Carrier respectively?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "At Carrier, it was the Fincoil, which is a Finnish commercial refrigeration business. And at Otis it was a Korean business, a motor business, non-core.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Small motor business in Korea.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "And just two other things. One is, if I am not mistaken, you probably were able to benefit slightly from the expansion in the spreads over treasuries for a pension discount rate. Is that fair?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "We have set the rate for 2008 and I think you will see that coming up it will be a little bit above 6%, I think about 6.2% in fact is the discount rate. So, a little bit better than what we had for 2007. Not materially different though in terms of the overall impact on the pension plan because there are other things that were going against us like salary growth. Thank you.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "And Fire & Security still had a charge. I think that was your largest charge you had for small business. It's also sort of the one that has had the most M&A. Could you sort of reconcile a little bit of how come you have not been able to totally capture the expected restructuring in the original purchase prices and or is this just some other things that are going on for an advantage?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Howard, we did have restructuring charges in Fire & Security. First chance really is just cross takeout throughout the business. Second is, sometimes in these deals... or I should say not sometimes, all the times, when you buy a company and you undertake restructuring you can put under the current accounting, you can put the cost proposing their operations up in purchase accounting while the cost across your legacy operations will go to the P&L. So, in the case of, for instance, initial rent scale in Europe we had a little bit of both of those kind of costs.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "And we go next to Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow up on Howard\u2019s question on commodity prices, it sounds like the answer is no, but fuel prices obviously looking to be much higher in 2008. You're buying more steel and copper and significantly more in steel than copper in Carrier. Is that a risk to 2008 margins?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Well I think, as we look into 2008, we will tell you that we do see some commodity headwind when you look at the year-over-year prices, it is much less as we look out now than we've seen in the last couple of years. If it stays where it is you might hear us talk about it about that less because the numbers are actually significantly down.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, okay. And then looking at Otis margin this quarter, you still got some significant OE mix issues but the margins are significantly better year-on-year and anything to talk about there, you talked about productivity but any step on productivity that we are talking about here?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think where it really goes to Nigel is simply factory cost productivity. We saw very, very good traction in the factories, good cost reduction both in the supply base as well as in the factories. That really was driving a big piece of the growth at Otis is a continued factory productivity.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "So that\u2019s\u2026 that flows through into 2008. So, we maybe we should see better margin expansion we saw in 2007?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Certainly the volumes continue to pick up, you're going to get absorption in the factories, which also helps on product cost but I think overall it is doing a much better job in the factories.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Great. And then just one final quick question on organic growth, you guided for mid single-digit next year, you are tapering down from 10 to nine to eight in the last couple of quarters. Should we expect that general decline to continue or do we see a step down to mid-single digit from here?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "I think organic for the year we feel good about mid single digits, we're not going to forecast it for the... by quarter. Again we are in uncertain times and we have to keep our minds open to the possibility that we haven't seen slow down, we could see well in the future, but right now we are not expecting anything to fall off the cliff, just to move down organic revenue growth from high single digits to the mid-single digit.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That's fair. Thanks a lot.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thanks Nigel.", "Operator", "And we go next to Myles Walton with Oppenheimer & Co.", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. And we talked about the business backlog in a lot of the businesses, one of ones you didn't mention was Pratt & Whitney, could you give us that number as well as the overall corporate at year end?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Sure. Pratt & Whitney ended the year with about $23.5 billion of backlog. That is up over $6 billion. So very, very strong backlog growth at Pratt. About half of that was really related to one contract, it was a northwest long-term service contract that we have to provide the engine maintenance, so a very strong backlog there. Overall for the corporation, we ended the year at about $57 billion of backlog and that's up just about $13 billion year-over-year. So, really there was strong backlog growth across all the businesses as we ended the year.", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "All right. Great. So it\u2019s about 30% year-over-year, book-to-bill 1.24 and kind of just as I look, it looks like kind of the best book-to-bill that you've had at least in terms of numbers I have. And so I guess a lot of these contracts that came through in '07 are longer lead times than usual, and that's what's driving to the only modest mid-single digit?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Certainly on the aero side where we have got these longer-term contracts like Pratt & Whitney as well as at Sikorsky where we have got larger, long-term deliveries to large parts of U.S. Military. Always I think you have the backlog there that typically builds out in 12 to 18 months.", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then maybe last one on Otis. I think you had about 1.5 of shift towards OEM in '07. What is the trend line in '08, are we going even more in that direction?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "We reached 48% in new equipment, a little bit more than that in the fourth quarter and that was as you said, up a point year-over-year at 1.5 sequentially. With the backlog we at, we\u2019re seeing a very strong backlog and the growth that we are seeing in the markets. I wouldn\u2019t expect that trend to reverse.", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "And let's take our final call Rufus.", "Operator", "And that final question will be from Joe Nadol with JP Morgan.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hi, Joe.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "First question is I just want to hound on specifically on spares at Pratt, so I think you gave overall aftermarket, but there has been some divergence between services and spares in the past. Wondering what you saw for spares in Q4 and what you are looking at for '08?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Well, let's start with the '08 because it's always better to look forward at the longer term, which is we have said that the aftermarket at Pratt including spares are going to decelerate from what we saw in the last couple of years that are\u2026 where they were going at about 20%. Something more like an RPM growth rate plus the annual price increase would put that right at double digits. We are not coming off of that. That's what we think for the next year. What we saw in the fourth quarter was the spares part of that market did grow slower than the overall side of the business.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Which means it was down, no?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Excuse me.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Which means it was down in the quarter.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "It was basically flattish. Yeah. That\u2019s right [inaudible] call it down.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Okay. So, that's what we saw in the quarter, but keep in mind we had that conversation a little while ago about the tougher compares year-over-year. So, I will also give you one other data point that sequentially, we actually saw spares in the fourth quarter a little bit stronger than the absolute number of spares in the third. So, nothing out there concerning us significantly.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Secondly, just on the Carrier residential business. You just gave pretty dire outlook and we all know housing is terrible but there have been some positive comps, I think in the last three months industry-wide according to ARI, and I am just wondering if that's not what you are seeing? The second part of the question is in terms of the margins, at this point, we all know things are terrible. At what point will you be able to cut enough cost out of the business to maybe get over the margin boost even with the top line that's not doing anything or still declining?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Joe, this is Jim. It's really frankly just too early to say anything good about the U.S. housing market, comparison or otherwise, because that market is in tough shape right now and again we should be clear on the fact that that market is very tough.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I'd also point out Joe, that we are not just sitting back waiting for the market to deteriorate. We are actually taking very aggressive cost reduction actions across that business. I think [inaudible] and team are focused on taking significant cost up both through restructuring and just weaning out the factory and the supply chain. So, there is still opportunity in that business even in a down market for profit growth this year.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Yeah, that's where I was getting at. Okay and then finally, just sort of a balance sheet question and this is little bit theoretical, but you put out you have a strong balance sheet as opportunities to buy back stock, obviously the M&A opportunities are really lighting it up compared to any time in the last few years. How aggressive are you willing to get with the balance sheet to really to take advantage of the opportunities out there?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Joe, we have a little of flexibility in the balance sheet. Obviously we value our credit rating. It comes in might handy at times like this when the rest of the world struggles. So, I think we can afford to be a little bit more aggressive but it is all going to come down to what opportunities are out there that present themselves so that we can go get. So there is no forecast today on what's is going to happen with either M&A or share repurchase. It's just to find us a more favorable environment with that kind of stuff than it was six months ago.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Can you specify how much of capacity you have to keep your credit rating?", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "I think, again at times like this and times that are changing it is best to retain flexibility. So, I don't want to give a number today. We will just... we are mindful of our rating and continue to grow the company.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.", "Ken Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks Joe.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thank you, Nadol. Okay. With this I think that's all for the questions. I will just take one second to summarize and first of all thank you all for listening in. I think as you have heard this morning a very, very strong close to 2007. I think you are all pleased with the way that each of the business delivered both on the earnings and the cash flow side. I would also say that as we look at 2008, we do not see kind of the dire economic circumstances that we read about everyday. The order backlog looks very strong. The business will do well this year and we will do well in any environment, and we are built to outperform and I think that's the key message here. You read a lot of bad things out there, but we will outperform and we will continue to deliver.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen this....", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "That's it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the United Technologies\u2019 fourth quarter conference call.

Morgan", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Operator", "Good day every one, and welcome to the United Technologies First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. On our call today will be Greg Hayes, the Vice President of Accounting and Finance; Jim Geisler, Vice President of Finance; and Ken Parks, Director of Investor Relations.", "Today's call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's homepage at www.utc.com. The company reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "And now at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Hayes. Please go ahead sir.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks you, Dena, and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning UTC had a solid start to the year driven by the strong performance across the businesses. Revenues were up 12%, including 7 points organic growth. Earnings per share were a $1.03 and that's about 26% over last year. As of the impact from the last year's Otis EU and gains and restructuring of whole periods, EPS was up 18%, really great start to the year.", "FX generated a small benefit in the quarter with a positive impact from the year, partially offset by foreign exchange headwind on Pratt & Whitney's Canadian operations. We invested this benefit along with some of the good news from the businesses into restructuring about $0.02 of EPS. Adjusting for restructuring and one-time items four of the six units recorded double-digit revenue growth and five of our six businesses reported double-digit profit growth.", "All three of our commercial businesses saw a margin expansion in the quarter, with Otis and Fire & Security up 50 basis points and Carrier up 40 basis points. This is the result of continuing tight cost control and good execution across the businesses. Both Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand saw a strong top-line growth as they continue to ramp up production and get basically a record backlog.", "And Sikorsky, despite shipping only 30 helicopters in the quarter improved profits 17% and margins 100 basis points. Good quarter all around and the kind of performance you can do expect from UTC. Ken [ph] can take you through the business unit details in just a few minutes, but we'll spend a couple of minutes addressing the question we have been hearing from all of you for the last couple of months. And that question of course is have you seen any signs of the slowdown in your business as a result of the slowdown in the US economy.", "As you all know we had expected there are some signs of botheration in order rates in our few of our shorter cycle businesses. But for the vast majority of UTC, the economic environment still looks very favorable. Looking now on the page three in our webcast we are trying to lay this out by major market segment. First, on the commercial aero side, we continued to see good growth on the OEM side of the business and backlogs remain very robust. Commercial aftermarket growth did slow a bit to about 6% in the quarter and high fuel prices are of course impacting the aero line.", "However, we still expect RPMs to grow 3% to 4% this year on strengthened business travel and emerging markets. We are watching the RPM trends closely since they have typically impacted the growth and clearly impacting consumer spending and economic downturns.", "Emerging markets; they remain buoyant in spite of the slowdown in the US economy. Foreign exchange also looks to be a tailwind for the year, although as we saw this quarter, a weak dollar is not universally advantages to all of our businesses. Commercial construction order growth while lower than last year remains solid, even in the US, where Otis saw order growth of nearly 20% in this quarter, and Carriers commercial HVAC business saw order growth of 5%.", "Moving to Hamilton Sundstrand's industrial businesses, some of the most economically sensitive business continued to see solid order growth in the quarter. So, where do we see the weaknesses? Well, US residential business continues to be challenge with housing starts now expected to be down nearly 35% in the already depressed levels of 2007. No surprise there. We're also beginning to see weakness in orders in our refrigeration business, both in the US and Europe. Fire & Security's US residential business which sells through the major retail chains has also been negatively impacted. And we're also seeing a bit of a slowdown in F&S's European Electronic Security business, primarily in the UK.", "Let's keep this in perspective, you should note that these markets combined represent only a little more than 10% of UTC's total revenues, so no surprises here. As you expect, as we see the US and a few of these European economies slowing, we are preparing by taking cross out of the business. We invested about $30 million this quarter in restructuring, and we anticipate additional restructuring actions throughout the remainder of the year.", "Total restructuring could approach $200 million for the full year, and made by good news on foreign exchange, continued strength in the businesses and a few one-time gains in the back half of the year.", "I will also point out that investment in new products like Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan and Hamilton's platforms on the 787 will continue to be a priority for us. These investments will fuel continued growth for years to come. Overall, E&D was $29 million higher year-over-year in the first quarter. And we continue to expect $200 million of growth for the full year, so we would reach high [ph] some over the next three quarters from E&D.", "Although, these trends will make the back half of the year more challenging, we remain comfortable with the guidance for both the individual business units as well as our overall UTC earnings and cash flow guidance for the year.", "Just a word on our Q1 cash; free cash flow as you saw, came in at about 65% of net income, not unexpected given the normal seasonality in the Carrier as well as lower shipments from Sikorsky and the inventory build on the aero side. Let me also point out that these high inventory levels remain an irritant to you and to us, and fixing this problem is a priority for all of us here at UTC.", "Bottom line on cash flow for the year though is unchanged. We still expect to meet our usual standard of free cash flow meeting or exceeding net income. Finally, we repurchased $801 million of UTC shares during the first quarter and we continue to expect repurchases to total about $2 billion for the year.", "With that, let me turn it over to Ken to take you to the business unit details.", "Kenneth Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Okay. Thanks Greg. Before I begin on page 4 let me remind you, I will talk to the segment results with restructuring added back and excluding one-time items just as we usually do.", "Otis delivered another strong quarter with profit growth of 19% on revenue growth of 16%. Foreign exchange contributed approximately half of the growth. Revenues increased in all geographic regions, led by double-digit growth in North America, China and Russia, reflecting robust new equipment backlog entering the year.", "Margins expanded 50 basis points, despite a continued shift in sales mix towards new equipment as the Otis team continued to execute their strategic initiatives on product and other cost reductions, new logistics acceleration, and fuel performance on new equipment installations. New equipment orders were up 20% in the quarter, reflecting double-digit increases in all geographic regions.", "At Carrier, operating profit increased 15% year-over-year on 9% higher revenues. Operating margins expanded 40 basis points in the quarter. Foreign exchange contributed about 6 points to the revenue growth and 9 points of the profit growth. The commercial HVAC business with double-digit revenue and earnings growth in all regions more than offset continued housing-related weakness in North America.", "Carrier has recently seen moderating growth in commercial HVAC orders and selling order rates in our refrigeration units particularly in the US. The overall moderation in order trend is consistent with our expectations as we enter the year.", "At UTC Fire & Security performance was solid, as revenue was up 28% and profits were up 38% in the quarter. Favorable foreign exchange contributed about 8 points to the revenue and profit growth. Acquisitions contributed the remainder of the revenue growth. Revenue decline is approximately 30% in the US residential business and low-single digits in the Electronic Security business in the UK entirely offset growth in the other regions and segments.", "Operating margin expanded 50 basis points year-over-year to 7.6%. Benefits of prior restructuring actions, primarily from the Kidde factory rationalizations and cost containment initiatives were partially offset by the impact of global US residential volume and recent acquisition and integration costs.", "Pratt & Whitney revenues increased nearly $0.5 billion or 18% in the quarter, led by 30% growth at Pratt & Whitney, Canada, and power systems revenues that more than doubled. Military revenues were up approximately 15%, on favorable mix as well as higher engine deliveries year-over-year.", "Operating profit improved 15% in the quarter, reflecting the higher revenues, partially offset by the unfavorable FX impact of the Canadian dollar, the entire year-over-year E&D supporting new program wins. The combined impact of these headwinds on operating margin was more than a 100 basis points in the quarter.", "Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were up 11% in the quarter with aerospace OEM, aftermarket and industrial all growing at double-digit rates. Operating profit grew 3%, and margins contracted in the quarter as a lower margin commercial volume accounted for substantially all of the aero OEM growth.", "In addition, Hamilton recorded incremental cost on fixed-price development programs in the quarter. Hamilton is currently accessing the risk due to the recent rescheduling of the 787 program; however, these changes clearly will put pressure on Hamilton's full year operating profit growth guidance of a $100 million.", "At Sikorsky operation profit was 17% on revenues that were essentially unchanged year-over-year. As a result operating margin expanded a 100 basis points in the quarter and reached 8%. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 30 large helicopter; 14 military and 16 commercial. Since the end of the first quarter, eight additional aircraft have been delivered, and we continue to expect more than 200 large aircraft deliveries for the year.", "Now, I will turn it over to Greg to wrap up.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Okay. Thanks Ken. So another solid quarter; 7% organic revenue growth, 18% earnings growth, continued backlog expansion, all of our businesses. In fact we ended the quarter with $60 billion in backlog, a record for UTC.", "While there is always opportunity for better performance in our business, we know that the balance of UTC works to deliver superior results in good times and bad. In the face of uncertain economic conditions, we are also well positioned to reduce costs of restructuring and continued base implementation; factories, the supply chain, and in the back offices. All of this is why we remain confident of our full year guidance of earnings per share in the range of $4.65 to $4.85 with revenues of $59 billion and free cash flow equal or exceeding net income.", "As you all know, UTC's Board last week elected Louis Chenevert as Chief Executive Officer of UTC. It's a significant milestone for the company, but all know, it's not a change in direction. Bringing shareholder value continues to be our number one priority under roof. We'll do it by focusing on strong top-line growth from innovative products and global market leading franchises, cost reduction and margin improvement, and disciplined cash flow redeployment, all of that executed by an experienced leadership team. We are confident we will deliver on our guidance for '08, growing top line in excess of worldwide GDP growth, and make investments in the company for a solid 2009.", "Please operator, let's just open up the call for questions. Alright, Dena.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you sir. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Steve Binder of Bear Stearns.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "Yes. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hey Steve.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "Good morning Greg. Can you maybe just touch on Hamilton's performance, and I think you touched on some of the fixed price issues, may be call out what the programs were. And you talked about, it just look like disappointing incremental margin performance, I am just wondering, is there a plan... a downside plan now, given the change in R&D engagement in the first quarter performance, and then also touch on Sikorsky's performance, with all the issue, that kind of held back deliveries this quarter and what the year looks like for Sikorsky.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Sure. Let me start with Hamilton. As you saw, margins were down a 140 basis points, not really unexpected and I think Dave mentioned that he expected that in conference back in February. The fact is OEM orders were up strong and we saw like 12% increase in OEM deliveries, and most of those, of course, went out with very low margin as they typically be on the OEM side, so no surprise.", "Aftermarket was strong, as we have expected. And I think may be the surprise a little bit was on some of these fixed-price development contracts. We are working on the A400M on a fixed-priced development contract. We have got some work at one of our subsidiaries in the UK, doing some helicopter work that is also a bit of an overrun. We got big numbers. We are talking less than $5 billion or $10 billion on each of these programs, but again with only 3% growth on the quarter that kind of shine through is a little bit of a bump.", "Overall though I still think, Dave is confident in his guidance. We are confidant in Dave's guidance for the quarter or for the year rather. And you will have to wait and see as going Boeing finalizes the reschedule of 787, how that impacts us. But clearly it's going to have some challenge to that, but nothing to derail us.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "And then if you look at you said order growth... is it order growth you touched on for commercial aircraft is", "Kenneth Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "We do.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "Mark around 6% or was that sales growth.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Sales growth.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "What was the order growth for Hamilton and Pratt in the quarter for aftermarket in particular catalogue spares.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well aftermarket... this is right. I think overall commercial aftermarket growth is about 6% across UTC. It was flattish at Pratt, and it was up, kind of high-single digits at Hamilton. So, if you think about the Pratt, just to everybody address for a second, it was flattish. So that's coming of a 20% growth in the last year's first quarter. We also saw a lot of inductions into the engine center, just with the average repair cost is a little bit lower than we had seen last year. So I don't see any big change here. I think the engines are still coming of going as we would expect, and the orders would be here by the end of the year.", "Kenneth Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "And Steve, booked growth on Pratt was about one, so the order growth was more.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "Right. My last question is well in touch... you touched on inventories already and receivable performance, clearly wasn't great in the quarter. But if you're going to align a business within UTC in the family, where are the plusses from a cash flow standpoint and minus? Who are the generators and who are the users?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well,I think we had... the biggest generator was obviously an Otis, because typically they had a very strong first quarter, and then had really strong performance across their business. Fire & Security had a good quarter from a cash standpoint. The aero business is not so good, as you were expected to see inventories grow like this, and as well as Sikorsky, because they only shipped 30 helicopters and missed some shipments at the end of the quarter which ultimately had some cash associated with them. So commercial side pretty good, Carrier, just normal seasonality, I am not concerned. It's the inventory grow that obviously we have our eye on.", "And Steve just touches for a second on Sikorsky because we have talked about the 30 helicopters. The backlog is obviously robust with the $12 billion of backlog at Sikorsky,", "and as you look at the commitment for the year which is 200 plus large helicopters, we are shipping 30 helicopters in the quarter. These things are light [ph]. There are a couple of things to keep in mind. We're out of the factory just the other day, Jim and I walked before the pipelines is full, the parts are their, we are building these helicopters. And what we've seen really is a big mix shift. Last year we shipped eight of the L models. The L models have about $4,000 of assembly. This year we're shipping Ms.", "In the quarter I think we shipped 10 Ms versus 2 last year in around $12,000. We also shipped some other models, Romeo [ph] models about $24,000 of assembly. So what we really have is this big mix shift where we got to get productivity on the floor. We have got to get these helicopters moving down the line at the right pace. And we shipped about eight helicopters so far this month. I am not concerned at all about the quarterly target. We are going to make those 200 helicopters, but it's little bit of a slow start, and we feel pretty good about it.", "Steve Binder - Bear Stearns", "Alright. Thank you.", "Kenneth Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Joe Campbell at Lehman Brothers.", "Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi Joe.", "Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers", "I wondered if you could say a few words and I don't want to know about the tactics of it, but about the strategy and why it is that you would like to acquire Diebold.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Sure Joe, Diebold; that is a very attractive property for a couple of reasons. It's number two in the world in ATMs. It has a great global footprint with a good presence in China and India, and it offers margin expansion opportunity. Margins right now or at least the last time they reported were down in the mid-single digits and that's where UTC businesses were back in the mid 90s. But one of the keys to that business also Joe is in growing margins and providing good service is to have a exceptionally good local service network and we have that notice. We are building some of the other businesses and maybe we can bring some of the management expertise to the business. So, I think ROIs looks very much by the UTC commercial business.", "Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Alright, thanks Joe.", "Kenneth Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks Joe.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray of Goldman Sachs.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Good morning, Deane.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Good morning, Deane.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "I was hopping you can address the raw material headwinds, Carrier vis-\u00e0-vis, the copper versus the earlier in the year, and where that stands in terms of... might that lead into any other contingency?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes, as you look at the first quarter results, really not much headwind from commodities like at Carrier net of the pricing recovery. I think our average price for copper was around $3.21 or $3.22 of the good, I think today's $3.96 or $3.97 spots. So first quarter, it's a one [ph] shipments quarter. I think where we are going to see commodity headwind would be in second and third quarter. As we already quantify that would be about $50 million of potential headwind. And the reason it's not more, as we do have a certain percentage of our suppliers on long-term agreements. So we locked in some of the copper, that's about 40%, and we've also locked in most of the steel. So as steel has rung up, since the begging of the year, we've only been protected by the LTA.", "So, we don't expect it to be a huge headwind. But $50 million is still... is a third of the operating profit growth at Carrier this year. So we have got some work to do save some costs out into to contain that.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "That's the same $50 million that you talked about at the beginning of years. So that hasn't changed correct?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "It has not.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, good. And then just at orders for a movement, 20% order growth looks stellar in this environment. How about on the negative side? In December you talked a bit about seeing a few push-outs, a few cancellations, I felt may be that was related to some financing on smaller projects. How does that change at the margin over the course of the quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "It really doesn't change at the margin. I would tell you, we still see a few of the smaller projects being deferred or delayed. The big stuff that we are still going out at the record levels, I mean 20% growth in North America, 20% order growth rate worldwide, stronger as in China. It's hard to find a soft spot outside of maybe at Southern Europe for orders right now. But again I think we are very confident that those guys are going to be work for the year, big bumps in the road.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Kenneth Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go to next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much. Just a couple of things. One; Greg is a lot of these working capital issues that you addressed, that sort of the nagging for a while, what is management team doing to sort of change the factor? We've kind of heard this for may be three quarters or so?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well, actually it had improved about [ph] two and a half years I think just to be fair Howard. Inventory has been growing. It's been the result of the two things primarily it's strong organic revenue growth, as well as the disruptions in the supply chain. And organic growth is still strong although it's a somewhat stable growth, and the supply chain issues are coming also under control.", "Let me just lay out. I think it is the number one issue that we have in terms of working capitals, as how do we get inventory under control this year. And I would just say this a little bit back in February. So, it 33,000 suppliers, it's the 75% of our cost to sales that we don't directly control and we need to do work on our supply chain and the supply base. We get the ACE operating systems embedded in their making.", "Now, down in the line of Sikorsky and we talked about 80% full rate to MRP, suppliers and 80% sounds like it's pretty good, but the fact is that means that are less than 20% of the Canadian [ph] similar helicopters station. So, there is still a lot of work to do in the supply base, and that will be I think the focus. It's not going to happen today or tomorrow. We are working on it. It's going to take some time. We think we'll get our factories where we want them to be from the productivity standpoint, et cetera, it's got to be in the supply chain next.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Well I mean, in the Europe almost a $1 billion in inventory, now some of that I grant you is currency, but it's almost a $1 billion in the quarter. I mean could year just articulate what you think you could do in terms of some turns for the year from where we are? And do you think you could be below year-end inventories?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well, the whole bunch stays same. I think the inventory is about $975 million roughly. In fact, that's just about $800 million net of inventory growth. $350 million of that is just normal Carrier seasonality, and that of course will turn into receivables here in Q2, will get back into the cash in the third and fourth quarter.", "On the euro side, we got a little bit of R&D that's capitalized on the balance sheet, that's under the Sikorsky programs [ph] as well as Hamilton. Having said all that, we still have $300 million, $400 million of growth at the aero unit that what we need to address. I'll tell you, inventory turn in total was down about 10, this quarter versus year end. Our focus obviously is to improve inventory turn. I'm not going to give you forecast today because very frankly anything I will tell you, I'm not positive, we could actually need it, but it a priority for us.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "I think that's pretty fair. Just two other things. One, we are all aware of the difference between the JTAD [ph] and newer version engine. How you're going about managing the wind down of that business. I know it's largely spares today and probably about may be 5% of your aftermarket business?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes in fact, I think that the number is closer to about 10%, Howard. So I tell you we have been managing that down through the impact at the JTAH going out of inventory pretty well for the last 10 years. And it's now surprise, because it's continuing to happen. But we are still shipping 400 large commercial engines out of Pratt last year probably a similar number this year. The V2500 fleet is growing. We are also of course taking share on the aftermarket to aftermarket services. So, the growth strategy at Pratt and in the aftermarket is pretty clear. It's to capture more of our own work, and it's also to capture more equipment everybody else's work.", "So, I don't see this as a huge issue. It's we have been affirming those for a long time. So, I think they are managing it pretty well in Pratt & Whitney.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "I agree, I just wanted to make sure, I... you had bounded it. And then last with the geared fan, there will be some opportunities to sell some participation interests in that. How will we see that offset on R&D later in the year?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "We assume we... well, we would assume there is certain level of partnership as we give guidance for the year that's $200 million of R&D and a $125 million of that was at Pratt & Whitney. That assumes some level partner participation may be 30% or 35%. And I think we are pretty comfortable with that level for the year. We signed up MTU so far. I think Hamilton has now signed up for engines. We also think we are well on track and making good progress on the GTF from a technology standpoint. And we think we feel pretty good about all the programs that GTF has won.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from George Shapiro of Citi.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Yes. Good morning Greg. We assume the inventory a little bit you've said $400 million in aero. How much of that would just be due to miss-shipments at the Sikorsky and how much is due to some of the tougher issues to get out.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think may be up to half of it... not quite half of that would be miss-shipments in Sikorsky, because adjusting about Sikorsky has been linear, delivering $50 cap rates a quarter and that's obviously not going to happen in the first quarter. But, that's about half of it, and the rest of it is maybe this is harder to get at supply chain inventory.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "And also, at Hamilton Sundstrand, how much of the inventory build maybe is reflecting not getting paid by Boeing on their 787 at this point?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well, it's not a huge number. We continue to obviously bring hardware in. We have been working with our suppliers to try and push their whole some of that at the supply base, and trying to be very aggressive in terms of not bring any more than we think we're actually going to shift. We didn't see inventory growth at Hamilton in the quarter. I wouldn't attribute it all to 787, I think it maybe increase, and it is really related to just big ramp up in OEM value across all of their product lines.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Okay. And if we go back to Pratt for a minute, the Joint Strike Fighter engine problems that you had, was that as shown as R&D to crack this quarter, or how do you handle that? Or was that small number anyone?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "That's a cost plus contract and I would tell you, typically in their cost plus they would cost and then maybe [ph] analysis the cost to be fixed. Most of that is covered by the contract. There wasn't any incremental R&D at Pratt & Whitney that have been flown through at the bottom line as a result of that.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "And then one last thing, at Pratt Canada if... what did you see is book to bill, I mean clearly the deliveries were pretty... were very robust?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes, deliveries were up 30%, I believe, the revenues are up 30%. We shipped over 800 engines. But the book to bill still remains about 1. So we got the good backlog, and it's remained pretty strong.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Kenneth Parks - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you, George.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Nicole Parent of Credit Suisse.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Good morning guys.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Good morning, Nicole.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hi Nicole.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "I guess big picture as you step back and think about Greg in your initial comments you talked a little bit about slight, pockets of weakness, as you look at Europe. Could you talk a little bit about as you see the tight credit markets impacting, general commercial construction trends? And then what's your outlook, have you guys seen any slowdown in the regions, specifically China?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I'll start with China, and I'll say there has not been any slowdown, still see very, very strong growth out of Chinese. In terms of... it's a great question because, looking... I guess it's striking to see some follow on to the credit crises in commercial construction as I said all these... that's up 20% and that is really go around the world with the exception of Southern Europe where we saw... really I think it was Spain primarily where we saw a little bit of the weakness for the year. But other than that, really have not seen much of an impact.", "There has been a glow up on China, the couple of statistics for you. Now if you look at it year-over-year, fixed asset investments up about 24%, real estate investments up about 33%, large construction projects up about 22%. We don't make those numbers up, it actually comes to a National Statistic Bureau of China. That is pretty good solid growth that's in China. So most of the lower impact that we can see in our markets is in the credit crises especially in immerging markets.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And I guess with respect to Sikorsky, can we just go back and think about, I mean just given kind of the right revenue and shifts in the number... in the quarter, and you talked about how you have already shipped, I think you said eight so far this month. I mean as we sit here and look about you cited the mix shift and kind of between L and M, and the hours that it takes to get it running, presumably we knew that. Could you just give us some sense as you look back over the metrics that you've really shown up within Sikorsky in terms of past dews everything else? Where we are and how we should get comfortable that there isn't going to continue through the year?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well the only thing I can tell you is, maybe it's a couple of things. Obviously it's got our attention that Louie has both these partners [ph] for the last... almost two years, since we had the initial where the labor acting down at Sikorsky back in 2006. And Louie has already the sell the new airline and brought that down in West Palm Beach, and he felt very good about what was going on down there. They said, look at the line, the lines are full, and I think it's just a fraction of coming down the learning curve more quickly than we are. And so we have got a little bit of difficulty on the hours on some of these newer models. That's what you expect. But I think our outlook have a concern I think 200 for the year, just at the ACE operating system there. We are working at this. We are going to hit the goal here in the next year or so. I just get confidence in the team down there, we do have performed [ph].", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And I guess just lastly on M&A, Jim, as you kind of step back and think about what's going on in the market. Have you seen a willingness of potential sellers to come down on price? And based on a competitive landscape, what you guys expect to be getting more aggressive, absent the both [ph].", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Sure. Right now on the call there are lot of absence to consider, but it takes a while for sellers expectations to reset some times. I might remember there is stock price or some valuation that they could have gotten last year, recently. And so based on while there is reset as well as the lot of industrial companies and folks that we might getting against or cover the same assets, we have pretty strong balance sheet. So, we look at lots of different things, but like any other deal Diebold included will stay just above.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thank Nicole.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks Nicole.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hi Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "So, do you... I think inventory is mentioned about the steel and long-term agreements. I mean, steels, it probably hard [ph] to hedge. I mean how long are these agreements been based on, when you guy expose to this price again?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "As long as our annual agreements module.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So 2009 if you are going to fuel price is moderating and then that's why we have to see that come through. Okay. And secondly, you mentioned 787... you took Pratt and Hamilton, is that a comment on E&D spend or is it supply chain or the both?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "It's all that. I think we have got a little bit of a impact on our factory as we try to move some of these ships, that has a lot of an impact. Supply base is going to have an impact on the E&D. I just can't give you a great answer today on what the overall look back [ph] is. We love the program and we continue to support it more heartedly. But it's kind of a little bit of a state of loss year having just heard the announcement or a week or so in terms of the rescheduling. We actually have had a formal modification of the given purpose over that [ph]. So, moving through that and Dave is committed to his is guidance for the year and we are going to figure out like the 77 within the guidance for the year.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Sure. And then on refrigeration you mentioned... I mean that's in the U.S., is that comment on just the state refrigeration or was that including the transportation as well?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "It includes truck, trailer [ph] in North America which has been slowed really for the last year and half or so, I guess. But it's really both pieces. We also saw little bit of slowness on container and the order rates, and very, very strong shipment order. But all the way through down a little bit there. So, it's a really a broader comment on the refrigeration business and so.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just finally then on the residential, it looks like trends turn up through 40% price increase. I think it's coming in June. Is carrier up on as well?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "No. In fact we have not yet had a residential price increase, and I think you're obviously looking at the market. But right now we're just trying to get our costs in lines to be very competitive in orders to be shipped [ph] that to be the most competitive market we have ever seen.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just a quick one on restructuring, you're going to be flat in the gains offsetting the restructuring or do you expect it to be net restructuring pay off?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "I think in '08 what we are looking at probably, we have $200 million of restructuring for the year. I would expect that gains will not equal restructuring. It will probably have a little bit more restructuring. I can't give you an exact number, and I don't know what the exactly gains are. But clearly as we go throughout the year we have got good news on foreign exchange as we see at least ahead of us here in the second quarter and some strong performance in our business as I am going to take that good news where [ph] we have invested in the restructuring.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Yes, thank you. So you have mentioned the FX good news, I mean on your February meeting you were talking about above $1.44 I mean euro, it's now a $1.58, renminbi is up, the yen is up, the Canadian loonie is starting to behave. Could you quantify what you are now assuming in terms of FX and why you didn't raise your revenue estimates?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well, we didn't raise our revenue estimates because FX as we all know, it does move around quite a bit. Obviously as we saw this quarter, we had 4% the revenue growth came out of that FX, there probably is more big needs to come on the top line from FX if the euro stays where it is. I think one of the things that we need to keep in mind and may be the little bit of new this quarter on FX is quite Canada has become a much bigger piece of the puzzle. Their cost structure obviously is in Canadian dollars, and then back to Canadian dollar contents being going up as you have resembled the lot more engines. And their sales are denominated in U.S dollars. So they had really felt the pinch over the last year or so, because they advance over the last two years loonie depreciated versus the dollar.", "Now as we look forward to the back half of the year, if you are going keep the euro where it is today, by loonie we still see good news from FX, and probably more than what we saw in the first quarter. And about half of that we had planned and the other half is probably opportunity. As we talk about opportunity, that's what we are talking about for a potential restructuring funding.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "You mentioned that if FX moves around which it does, so you were assuming a 1.44 on the euro in your plan. Based on your current guidance, what's the number, what are you assuming?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Again if you play out the number today at 1.58 I believe which is where the euro is and you keep loonie, you can see may be again versus last year you might see another a $0.10 or so of additional FX good news for the year.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Got it.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "May be just one other comment on that because clearly FX could be good news for the corporations to move throughout the year, particularly versus our plan, and we have seen a little bit of it in the first quarter. But I think we also have to keep in mind that the environment is tough, and I think there is probably going to be some offset to FX. They are certainly possible in the second half of the year. We know that now is a good time for overreaching or over promise, and I don't think you want us to be in that position and we don't want to be in that position.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Right, right. If we look at the quarter, R&D was only up as you pointed $29 million, so that was kind of a surprise and it wasn't much. But SG&A was up 50 bps, really a huge gain about $240 million. Can you explain kind of why was the SG&A up, anything abnormal in there, and kind of how should we think about the build in both R&D and SG&A over the remainder of the year?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yeah let's do the SG&A first Cai. Up about $240 million as you said year-over-year in the quarter, about half of that is related to acquisition and FX combined. So you can kind of put that into one bucket. Then the other thing I'll point out to you is you remember last year we saw that the distribution for California Carrier business, that has... that had some impact in the quarter, and then the rest of the growth is really just a growth related to the volume.", "Now, let's talk about R&D for just a minute. As you pointed out, that's $29 million year-over-year in the quarter. About a third of that is at Pratt I would say. But as we told you all the way along as we started in third quarter call last year going through our February meeting, we can anticipate the R&D to be more timed into the second half of the year because of the programs that we are talking about and perhaps to GTF related programs. So, I guess I'll attribute some of that to timing and we are still saying that and confident that R&D will be an increase of around $200 million for the year. So, it's clearly calendarized more to the second half.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "But SG&A was 11.9% of sales, is that what we are assuming for the year because it was 11.2% last year? Or what's SG&A likely to run as a percent of sales?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "I think we would not tell you to expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to creep up for the year.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "From what level?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "From last year's level.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "So therefore, it's going to be a plus going forward year-over-year in terms of percentage of sales?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think negative is the right word.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Right.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "And can you explain that. I mean I am still... I guess I am still confused?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Well,I will give you one data point which is European operations, right. So for Carrier, you have got European operations but their big selling season is early of the second quarter, which you got their cost infrastructure in place in the first quarter that's converting at a higher euro. So you have got more euro dollars on the front end on the cost side and you'll have the selling season after that. So, that's one reason of a long list.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay, terrific. Thank you very much.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thanks Cai Von.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about what have you seen in aerospace, analyzed actually with the five bankruptcies, talk about the Northwest-Delta merger. Can you us a sense of bandwidth to may be a high-low range of what you think this means for commercial aftermarket for Pratt as far if we get some retirements strictly on the Northwest Airlines fleet. And also talk about what happens to long-term service engine maintenance contract you have with Northwest?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well let me try and dissect [ph] again Heidi. First of all on the Bangkok Airlines, I think you have all read about that, we have all seen that, not really an impact to Pratt & Whitney or to UTC more specifically. In the small airlines, we didn't have real exposure per se in terms of receivables or anything.", "And the Northwest-Delta merger, of course, those are two very important customers to Pratt & Whitney... the Pratt & Whitney power fleets. I think the good news as we look at this the potential merger and also the potential because it's not done yet, is the fact that they don't have a lot of overlap on their route structure. As a result, we don't see this as really a client to take a lot of capacity out of the combined two airlines. Obviously, their synergies would cost G&A and perhaps maintenance. But again these are both very good customers. They applied Pratt order [ph] perhaps that can be value both of them.", "I think long term, it makes for a stronger industry to have a consolidation, and if oil is at a $110 or a $115 a barrel, or wherever it is today, I think there is going to be lots and lots of pressure on combined airlines to push for a new, more fuel-efficient fleet. I think that's why we are very confident with the GTF. It is going to give us a leg up in this competition going forward. We've got the procedures, we've got the MRJ, we've got potential for other opportunities there I think. Again this is long term good news for Pratt & Whitney and UTC and the airline industry.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Does the maintenance contract list all potential opportunity or have you... I mean if they park that contract and they move on, so does that implications... does that move the needle in terms of earnings for Pratt?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well, Heidi, I don't know though that I can speculate in terms of what that impact is. We've got... we have contracts in place with the new service revolving the fleets. It's hard to be specific. All I can tell you is, we are balance towards the UTC and it works in Pratt & Whitney, and they are going to... this is not really a bump in the road for them.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. A couple more questions, if you don't mind. Going back to the inventory question, that's been asked a couple of times, can you give us a little more color maybe, flesh out what you expect on quarterly progression or may be talk about what you think is reasonable to expect by year end? What would you define a satisfactory progress on inventory?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Heidi, it's Jim. We have talked a lot about inventory today and inventory is important. But... and we must do better full stop [Technology Difficulty] posed on the big picture, and inventory is one on one in the cash flow. And this quarter free cash flow is showed in net income because of Carrier seasonality. We are prudently managing both of that [ph] over the last four quarters, and see the free cash flows has been in excess of net income, when we take out Carrier seasonality. So we'll have more even in the future on inventory, obviously we have to do better. But we also have to remember big cash flow in total.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "No, I know that. I just wondered if you for the stake in Sundstrand, so where you start to find your self feeling better about it? That's just for context, that's all.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "I think when we have better churns well in inventories; we will start to feel better.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "All right. On 787, Boeing finally came out with full way production to tenement [ph] by 2012. Can you talk about what kind of investment might be required to take the rates there on your side, the capacity side now for seven?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "No, that Heidi will [indiscernible] for what we believe is the long-term production rate. But we're actually thinking it could be up to 12 months. So I don't see there is any incremental in this. And I think if you can mind 75% or 80% of this content comes out of our own supply base, so it's not a huge incremental piece to Hamilton. But there is no big news there is in terms of the additional investment.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "That's great. And just a couple of quick ones. Hamilton Sundstrand did I hear correctly that the industrial orders were solid, was the book-to-bill north of one there?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, the stock buyback I think I missed it. How much did you guys spend and how many shares did you buyback?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "$801million now taking average rates of about $71 or so, be back about 11 million shares Jim tells me.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thanks very much.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thanks Heidi.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Joe Nadol of J.P. Morgan.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hi Joe.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Hi Joe.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "On cash flow and not on inventories.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yes.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "On receivables actually, you had an upward tick there that was much more than the usual. I am wondering if you could give any color on that, perhaps Greg like you did on inventories, if you could break it down into may be the bigger chunks?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "In the", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yes. Let me tell you that we've got a growth in the quarter that's, each chunk of it is due to the other services billing which is difficult for the first quarter and an even higher number year-over-year because they are north of that business, and that's probably couple of $100 million or so. But next big chunk would be at Carrier which is kind of the seasonality as we go into the selling season for the residential business in the US. And then the rest of it fairly spread evenly.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Just organic growth.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yes.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Because it was up more than the usual... sort of last quarter.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Most of the up more is due to the progress in sales at August.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then if you look at cash flow, just free cash flow by month over the first quarter, I don't know if you have these numbers. But was March weaker than you might have expected or was it sort of a typical pattern.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Well. I'm not going to get into I guess monthly forecast to reviews of cash. I would say, there is no surprises in March. Business remained strong. There wasn't any deterioration in receivables or collections or anything like that. It was really just the usual normal our working cash flow every day here obviously. And no surprises, no weakness in the businesses, no underlying trend that I would be concerned about.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Right. Okay. And then on the share repurchase, you bought back a very, very even 500 million a quarter last year. And obviously this was a tick up. You are keeping your guidance for the year. I am just wondering, if you look at your pattern it hadn't really been opportunistic in the past, it's been pretty steady. Your stock was down in the first quarter, you bought back more. Was is the change in your behavior or how do we interpret the higher number in first quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I don't know it's a change in behavior. Obviously when the stock was in the 60s it was just a hell of an investment in this, so we just piled in. And in fact, we like the stock as an investment. The $2 billion place over is still in place for the year, but we are going to continue to go out. The stock is price of levels that we think shouldn't be, we're going to go out and buy.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Do youthink perhaps there is some possible upside to that that $2 billion number, you are just not ready to move up, up yet.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "These numbers are all place-overs, Joe. We'll see how the year progresses. Right now, we're still sticking by the $2 billion and we will come back again at the end of the second quarter and update on all of this.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thanks Joe.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks Joe.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Good morning.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "On Fire & Security, you have talked about getting margins above 10% or at least to 10% this year. The first quarter was well below that. Could you talk about how you expect this to progress over the year?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "We have got a couple of things happening in the first quarter that held it down. And before I tell you that I will also remind you that in the February we when bill was in front of me, we said exactly that. We said the margin expansion will be greater and that as we progress with the year. During the first quarter remember that we still do have the land corning [ph] business and our numbers. And the Australia piece will go away in the near term, and the U.K. stays. But that does all the margins down a bit.", "Also as we have said we do have the acquisition... investments related to the acquisitions on the integration side that the initial... may be of the other acquisitions we built last year. So, for all those reasons while we would like to see a very non-seasonal margin progression, also not only in Fire & Security, we have said that will take a few years to do and this year would still be more back end more of those, and those couples of reasons and some of the primary factors.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "But you still expect... if you expect the 10% for the year when you are looking at really getting to a more sustainable run rate above that if you are going to concentrate for the first of all at the beginning?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yes. We are still... we are not coming of about 10% for the year, and we are confident we can get there.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "And then more broadly when you've talked about conservatism in terms of how you are looking at the back half of the year, are there any specific areas that you are more concerned about than others?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes. I don't know if there is anyone particular business. Obviously, we have talked about a lot of different things in the environment there. The aerospace aftermarket and again RPM growth, we are keeping an eye on that. We are also obviously in the shorter cycle businesses at both Carrier and Fire & Security. We have already seen a downturn or a softening there. Those are the businesses that will move us around in a short term in the second half of the year.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "So, no real single thing that... more of a general sense that you need to be conservative.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes, I think we read the same papers that everybody else does. And I think that we do believe that there is a softening in the US economy whether or not we are in the recession and leading to the economist to tell us that in about two years. But right now we know there is softening in the US economy. We are going to prepare for it, by taking cross out of out of our businesses.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Thanks Doug.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Ronald Epstein of Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Good morning guys. A couple of questions. You spoke about the commercial construction in Asia. Can we just talk about some of the other regions of the world? What you're seeing in Europe, in Eastern Europe, Western Europe? And if we can maybe take just a little trip around the world in terms of construction.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Commercialconstruction in Europe, I would say it was very strong, but regionally strong in Eastern Europe. Russia and Ukraine, Poland I think all of those markets remain very, very robust; Southern Europe, not so good. A little bit of over building as we had expected in Spain, and also I think the UK has been softening now. And so, there is New Europe and Old Europe, I guess, and Old Europe is not moving quarters as quickly as New Europe.", "We go around Asia. It looks pretty good there with the exception of Japan. Japan has been slow to declining here in the quarter. Korea looks to be coming back a little bit, not in double digits, but fairly good order growth in Korea. India, I think everything is on track there. It's maybe a little lumpy, but it's I don't think we have any concerns. In South America, not a big piece of our business continues to be a very, very good.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Also just kind of change gears here to Pratt. You guys mentioned this in one of your charge that 18% organic growth in Pratt. You said aftermarket spares were flat, is that right, and is that what you told Steve [ph]?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yes.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "So, what was driving that 18% growth, that's huge?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "It's Pratt Canada. Well, as you say, it's Pratt Canada which was up about 30%, you also had good growth on the military side, you have higher... about nine higher military engines delivered in the quarter", "Unidentified Company Representative", "And the power system", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "And the power systems business was also up very strongly. So, we have kind of a broad based strength in the Pratt.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Now in power system that you said was up I guess two times, and that you said in your prepared remarks. What was driving that? I mean does that... derivatives or what is that?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yes. And we have seen it for the last I think 18 months or so. That has been a very strong part of... has been in a good place of the market I should say.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Lots of demand out there for power. And I think this where they are going to great start here with Pratt power systems to deliver on that right now.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, okay. And then just one last question if I may, did your turbofan, you guys brought that up a little bit, what's the next milestone we should be looking for I mean, to your fan?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well, we just... I think we have completed about 40,000 take-off and land... equivalent [ph] take-off and landings on it. We're loading the new engine in the new missile. We're going to fly it. I think there is the most public milestone you are going to hear about it is flight estimate in the middle of the year. And then that I think we are pretty confidence going to happen, I don't know if June, July, August timeframe. We will fly when it's ready, but we certainly expecting that by the mid-year.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thanks Ron. Okay. Dena can we take our next caller, please?", "Operator", "Absolutely sir. We will take our final question today from Myles Walton of", "Oppenheimer.", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hi Myles.", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Greg you have taken the conservative stands not raising it to the full year guidance. But I guess maybe the important question is where the contingency stands with respect to the full year guidance. I think you started the year at about $150 million at the top end of the range. So with that that's here it looks like may be that's plus $50 million to $100 million offset a little by Hamilton. So, I guess my question on line, where is the contingency today with respect to the top end of the guidance?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "You ended that pretty well Myles. I don't know if I can add much to it. The fact is that we started the year with a $150 million in contingency. We still feel a very, very good about the year, because we had contingency because of the good news on FX. And again, it's a solid contingency. Right now, as you mentioned Hamilton's got a little bit of potential risk, and it always be a one-to-one [ph] commodities at Carrier whether that's going to continue flow through. But overall, I will tell you, we just feel very good about the year.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "And again just to fall [ph] into that and earlier comment... may be we do feel very good about the year, and you are right the math is all higher, right. It's an environment that can change and this no benefit with three quarters of the year lap to overreach or go higher and again I don't think we don't want to be in a position or been in the stress like that in possibly declining environment, only you want us to be, releasing our raising doing calls and reduction [ph] either.", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "No, I think that... I think it's good commentary, though I mean essentially that your contingency is flat to up, and you're looking away some of the uncertainties over the back half of the year, and I think that's important takeaway.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Thanks Myles.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks Myles.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Okay. Thanks Myles.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Okay. Let me just may be wrap up with just two last thoughts, if I can. First of all, as you have heard we have got a very, very good quarters, strong backlog. And of course there is a little bit of economic uncertainty on the horizon. But we are confident on our guidance, and we are going to work to continue the each trend with [ph] you guys as we always have. This is a culture of no surprises and we don't endeavor to make sure that there are no surprises as we look forward. And may be conservative but we think it's appropriate in this environment. We have great operating systems here to ACE. We are really focused on the significant guidance for the year [ph]. so we have a good quarter and I think it's going to be a very good year.", "Lastly, I just want to say thanks to Ken Parks. Ken Parks is leaving soon, maybe about right after this call, in fact to become CFO at UTC Fire & Security. He has been doing a great job here over the last two years. So we thank him very much, and I know you guys can out him, so you allow [ph] him words of thanks. But he has done just a tremendous job.", "At the same time, we are also going to welcome Keo Jordan [ph] back to corporate office as Head of our Investor Relations now. He is leaving Fire & Security for almost five years, five long years. He was in the IR, so he me remember a very short time back in the 2003. We welcome back the Keo; I think he is uniquely positioned with his operating experience at Fire & Security so you can see him these next few years.", "So thank you ken and welcome to the Keo. Keo been on the call this afternoon with him so please take your moment and welcome the Keo back as we all do. So we now thank everyone, and we will be talking to you. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today conference call. Thank you for your participation.

(NYSE:UTX) Q2 FY08 Earnings Call July 17, 2008 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Gregory J. Hayes - VP, Accounting and Finance", "Akhil Johri - VP, IR", "James E.

Morgan", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Vice President of Accounting and Finance; Jim Geisler, Vice President of Finance; and Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations.", "This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's homepage at www.utc.com. The company reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks you, Nicky and good morning everyone. You saw in the press release this morning, we had anther very strong quarter driven by solid performance across the business.", "Revenues were up 13%, with six points of organic revenue growth. Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.32, and that's up 14% over last year, and includes $0.06 per share of uncovered restructuring charge. Absent the impact of restructuring, and the results for both second quarter of '07 and '08, earnings per share was up 17%. Foreign exchange generated a net $0.04 benefit in the quarter, positive impact from the euro and other currencies, partially offset once again by the FX headwind that's present [ph] with these Canadian operations.", "Most importantly, we remain confident about the year. Accordingly, we're taken our earnings guidance for the full year up to a range of $4.80 to $4.95 a share, and that's up 12% to 16%, $0.15 on the bottom, $0.10 on the top of the prior range. These increases are on the back of better earnings of Otis and UTC Fire & Security. Both units are now expected to the deliver operating profit guidance... or operating profits higher than the guidance already inbuilt in firm just this past February.", "All the other businesses are on track with the prior profit guidance. You should note that the revised guidance does assume the year with a current spot rate of about $1.58, and you'll recall that our plan assumed the euro rate at about $1.44, a little bit of tailwind there.", "We're also updating our guidance on full year revenues. We now expect it to be over $60 billion. And on restructuring spending as well, year-to-date we've incurred about $130 million in restructuring costs, all of this uncovered by gains. We do expect some gains in the second half for the year, and we are also increasing today our outlook for restructuring spending for the year to about $300 million. That's double the $150 million we forecasted at the beginning.", "Now as you know, it's not unusual for us to see some lumpiness in the timings of gains and restructuring on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But, we do expect that restructuring will be significantly in excess of gains for the full year.", "And free cash flow, it came in at 87% of net income, quarter-to-quarter. It's primarily due to Carrier seasonality, as you would expect, as well as slightly lower advances at Sikorsky.", "We are encouraged however by inventory performance in the quarter. And the overall level of inventory remains high, especially, at the aero businesses. Although inventory was essentially flat for the quarter, improving inventory performance remains a focus; there is still a lot of work to do.", "And full year cash flow, we expect the usual UTC standard of free cash flow greater than or equal to net income. Also in the quarter, we repurchased $719 million of UTC shares bringing the year-to-date total to over $1.5 billion.", "In this full year, we may continue to be optimistic in our repurchases. The share repurchases will likely exceed the $2 billion guidance that we have for the year, especially, if the stock continues to trade at decade low P/E multiple.", "Another key, I will take you through the business in details in just a minute, but let me talk about some of the concerns here as we have been hearing from investors over the last few months. And those concerns are of course, commercial aerospace markets, commercial construction order trends and commodity inflation. Now, with oil around $135 a barrel, we are all concerned about the impact for our airline customer's profitability, and the associated capacity reductions they'll have forecasted.", "In the second quarter, large commercial engine spare parts sales at Pratt & Whitney were about flat with last year, generally in line with Pratt's expectations going into the year. And book-to-bill was marginally below one. And with concerns around its commercial spare parts and the sale... parts sales in the quarter, we were in the mid single-digit range. For the year, our outlook for spares at both of these divisions remained generally in line with where they were at the start of the year. But, we'll be watching these trends closely.", "As for commercial construction activity, we continue to see very strong orders that brought us decent growth in Carrier's commercial business. In the quarter, in North America, new equipment orders were at double-digits, worldwide orders were up 23%. Carrier's commercial HVAC business, new equipment orders in North America were essentially flat in the quarter. But commercial HVAC orders worldwide were up double-digits.", "In Europe, new equipment orders at both companies were strong in the quarter, with Otis up nearly 40%. Well, about half of that was from the benefit of the euro. Otis saw particularly good growth in France, Germany, Eastern Europe.", "Carrier's commercial HVAC business grew about 12% in Europe in the quarter at a constant currency rate. Asian orders for both companies continued to grow at double-digit rates.", "Our refrigeration orders at Carrier both in North America and Europe continued weaker in quarter as we had previously discussed. We're also mindful of the construction industry forecast for the U.S. are generally down, although our order book doesn't indicate this yet.", "Given this overall environment, all of our commercial businesses are continuing to focus on cost reduction and restructuring actions.", "Last issue I want to touch upon is commodity cost increases. Recall, going into the year we expect a gross commodity cost impact including energy, to be about $200 million, with about half of that offset by pricing. We now see these gross commodity costs increases of over $300 million. Pricing is still expected to offset a little more than half of the impact.", "As you all know, steel prices are roughly double than past year along with the cost of oil. Some of the metals used in the aero businesses as well as copper are also up, although to a much lesser extends.", "On the other hand, we are getting better pricing than anticipated. In some, higher commodity cost than anticipated at the beginning of the year, but also a better pricing environment.", "UTC's response to all of these challenges of course to continue to work on cost and productivity, while we bump the year's restructuring to about $300 million, also why we continue to focus on the implementation of basic cost in all of our businesses. As a result to tight cost control, restructuring and process improvement, we saw 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, adjusting for restructure.", "Our portfolio of companies has allowed us to outperform in the past, we expect to continue to outperform even in the current market environment. Our target of 10% and more earnings growth annually remains unchanged. Our executive compensation incentives are all tied to this target.", "I will turn over to Akhil and have you walk through the business.", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Greg. Before I begin on page four, let me mention that I will talk to segment results with restructuring added back as we usually do.", "Otis delivered another very good quarter. Revenues increased 19%, the growth in all geographic region led by double-digit growth in North America and Russia and China. This reflects the strong new equipment backlog entering the year, as well as higher modernization and the fair sales in Europe, which benefited from changes to elevator safety laws in France and Spain.", "Operating profit grew 25%, as higher volume, product cost reductions and other cost containment initiatives more than offset headwinds on input cost increases. Feasible foreign exchange contributed approximately half of the improvement in revenues and profit. As a result of all of the above, operating margin expanded by 90 basis points to 19.8%.", "Otis new equipment orders were up 23% in the quarter as Greg mentioned 14% at constant currency, reflecting double-digit increases in all geographic areas. In light of very strong first half performance and Otis current expectations, we are now increasing profit growth guidance for Otis from 10% plus to nearly 20% for the full year. Also we are increasing revenue growth guidance from high single-digit to low teens.", "At Carrier, operating profit increased 9% on 7% higher revenue. Foreign exchange contributed about five points of revenue growth and six points of the profit growth. Operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 12.2%. Benefits from product cost reduction and prior restructuring action in the commercial HVAC and North American residential businesses more than offset $30 million of net commodity headwind in the quarter, an adverse shift towards lower margin segment in the refrigeration and international residential businesses.", "The commercial HVAC business remains solid with mid single-digit revenue growth. On the negative side however, we still have the U.S. housing recession. Cooling season started poorly in Europe and commercial refrigeration markets are down both in Europe and North America.", "In the face of market softness, Carrier has launched significant restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. As a result, we remain comfortable with Carrier's full year earnings growth guidance of 10% plus on mid single-digit increase in revenue.", "UTC Fire & Security performance was also strong. Revenue grew 29% with acquisitions contributing 18 points and foreign exchange seven points of this growth. Organic growth was 4% with the fire safety businesses in Europe and the Americas up mid single-digits. The security business in Europe up low single-digit and the man guarding business is down moderately in the quarter.", "Operating profit increased 46% with foreign exchange contributing eight points of the growth. Benefits of restructuring actions and continuing productivity initiatives along with the profit contribution from acquisitions were partially offset by the impact of lower U.S. residential volume. Operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 8.8%.", "Based on performance to date, we are increasing UTC Fire & Security full year operating profit growth guidance from 25% to 30%. We are also increasing the revenue growth guidance from high single-digit to mid teens.", "Now, turning to the Aerospace businesses on slide seven, Pratt & Whitney revenues increased 6% in the quarter, led by continued engine volume growth at Pratt & Whitney Canada.", "Revenues improved over 20% at Pratt Canada, revenues at Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and Power Systems also grew over 10%, while military revenues are essentially flat. Large commercial engine aftermarket grew low single-digit with spares [ph] about flat.", "Operating profit also improved 6% in the quarter led by the military business on favorable aftermarket performance and improved engine mix. This was partially offset by adverse top visit mix in the large commercial engine aftermarket business. Profit contribution from high revenues at Pratt Canada was largely offset by the unfavorable foreign currency impact from the weaker U.S. dollar. E&D [ph] for Pratt was essentially flat in the quarter.", "We continue to expect Pratt & Whitney revenues to be up mid single-digit and operating profit to be up approximately 10% for the year.", "Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were up 18%, with aerospace OEM and industrial businesses up nearly 20% each.", "Commercial aftermarket revenues were up double-digit, operating profit grew 11% and margin contracted in the quarter, primarily from adverse mix. Lower margin development revenues grew by about 20%, while higher margin commercial spares revenues grew only mid single-digits. Hamilton also faced pressure from commodity and input cost increases during the quarter.", "For 2008, we now expect revenues at Hamilton to the higher up low teens. We continue to see operating profit up 10%, or $100 million as indicated last December.", "At Sikorsky, operating profit grew 28% on 9% higher revenues. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points in the quarter to 8.5% from higher military volume and favorable mix.", "During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 53 large helicopters; 37 military and 16 commercial. Sikorsky remains committed to its guidance of more than 200 large aircraft deliveries for the year. Sikorsky continues to expect mid-teens revenue growth, with operating profit up approximately 25% in 2008.", "Now, let me turn it back to Greg, to wrap up.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. While we open the call up to questions, let me just hit on a couple of the significant new product milestones that we've achieved just this past quarter.", "First on the 787 program, Boeing, as you no doubt heard, has successfully completed 787's power-on testing with the support of Hamilton Sundstrand. Next big milestone on 787 of course is its first flight which is scheduled for later this year.", "Second big milestone for UTC of course is the GTF or fuel-powered W1000 as we now call it, which flew successfully for over six hours 747 tested this past week. Most importantly, engine met or exceeded all of its pre-test performance criteria [ph]. This will of course power the new Bombardier CSeries aircraft, which was formally launched earlier this week, and a letter of interest for up to 60 aircrafts from Lufthansa.", "Finally, in the commercial space, UTC Powers had [ph] an order to supply 12 of our brand new 400 kilowatt fuel cells, with the Freedom Tower and three other towers at the World Trade Center site in New York.", "All right, summing it all up, it's been a very good quarter, more noteworthy given the economic uncertainties that we're all dealing with. Revenues up 13%, EPS 14%, net of restructuring 17%. Increased guidance 15% on the... $0.15 rather on the bottom of the range and a dime at the top, now expect 12% to 16% EPS growth for the year. Not an unusual performance for UTC is more the same type of performance you have come to expect. Balance across geographies and product, up restructuring fast productivity mentality, especially in more challenging times.", "In an unusual strong string of product launches which looked to be highly successful in the markets. Of course, cash content and net income supported increased cash returns to shareholders. It's too soon to talk about 2009 specifically. You should know that we're all focused on double-digit earnings cash flow growth.", "With that, let's open up the call for questions. Nicky?", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from the Nicole Parent from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Good morning", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hey Nicole.", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Hi, Nicole.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "I guess first let me think about commercial, the order numbers across Otis and Carrier on the commercial side was very strong. Can you just talk, I guess a little bit about are you seeing any cancellation, where you guys see or you are in terms of the order across that, when you think about what your products are going into and kind of the comfort with the sustainability of the orders that you are seeing and I guess with respect to how do you look ahead when you just look at the backdrop of the environment and the Dow [ph] and the AVI numbers in terms of thinking going forward, do we see cancellations in some of these orders that you are getting?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks, Nicole that's a great question. I wish I had the crystal ball to tell exactly what's going to happen --", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Me too.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Couple of quarters. You know what we can tell you, what we see out there in the market is, we have not seen order cancellations any extent. Now, there is always the odd, the one-off cancellation, but we have not seen large scale cancellations anywhere.", "I think the one soft spot as we continue to note is now at about the lower end of the product lines, some of the low, low and mid rise office buildings as well as on anything that touches the retail. So, it's good malls in the retail side of order of Carrier's HVAC business here in the U.S. And China still very, very strong and Europe actually surprises I would say with the strength that we've seen there.", "We all see what the indicators are out there. We all hear that things should be slowing down. We just have not yet seen any significant slowdown at any of our businesses outside of say commercial refrigeration in the U.S. and Europe. And again, I attribute that more to the retail spend than general commercial construction. So, so far so good and we're obviously watching it closely.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Okay. With respect to restructuring, you guys absorbed an enormous amount of restructuring in the quarter. When we think it's probably reasonable to think about restructuring effort at the Carrier, but you also ramped it up at Fire & Security and Pratt probably relative to my expectations in prior quarters. Could you just give us some sense on what's going on there and how we should think about that number for the full year?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes, we did do as I said $130 million year-to-date. It's got a lot of restructuring at Carrier obviously in response to what's going on in the residential market there as well as on the refrigeration side of the business. I think what you're going to see for the rest of year, is just more of the same.", "These actions have been... is primarily people-related, and we have closed a couple of factories and taken out about 1 million square feet. The actions to date have affected about 2500 people. It's about 1% of our worldwide workforce. I think as you go to the second half of the year, more the same, more restructuring at branch, more restructuring at Carrier, and the continued restructuring at Fire & Security.", "But, I would say, no big change here. It's just a focus on taking cost out to continue to be competitive in this very difficult environment.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "And one last one just on M&A, as we see the commercial airspace names get head on concerned about the end of the cycle. Could you give us a sense of what your thought is on aerospace acquisitions, then also give us an update on the Diebold?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yes Nicole, this is Jim. I think obviously with the decline in the market, aerospace evaluations are more attractive. Many of them know they've only been more attractive for couple of weeks, so I think it might take a while for sellers, potential sellers' expectations to reset. We're a buyer in aerospace. That's clear and hopefully that opportunity or opportunities in aerospace will arise and they will be greater than they've been in the last couple of years.", "On Diebold, it's a good property. It has very good ATM share. It has a great global footprint, and obviously there is margin expansion opportunity, because it's in mid single-digits and UTC runs its businesses in double-digits. But it's never been a must half. We made our proposal back at the end of February and a lot of time has passed and there are other opportunities in the world, including buying UTX stock, so now we'll have to see.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thanks. Good quarter.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Thanks, Nicole.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you, good morning.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Hi Deane.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Just to clarify on Nicole's last question, a couple of data points you used to provide in the backlog of both on the commercial side Otis and Carrier. Otis was of 18 months on the last update and six months on Carrier, where do those stand today?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I have said that, they are just about the same. We've seen strong order growth or continued strong order growth there at Otis. Our backlog is relatively constant, so to tell you we still have about 18 months of visibility on the new equipment side. It is the same on Carrier, but just to be specific; it's Carrier BSS or commercial business that we're talking about. We've got, six months visibility. And those orders outside of U.S., it remains relatively strong, backlog was pretty good.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then the second question relate to... I know you said that you will be light on 2009 specifics, but with regard to the press release comments and intro comments regarding the potential slowing and expected slowing in commercial aftermarket on the aero side, can you talk a bit about what the offsets might be? What would be different in '09 versus '08 in terms of your mix, let's say that powered by the hour contract, the number of deliveries side of Pratt & Whitney, Canada. So, just give us in context as we can certainly see the expectations about capacity coming out of the U.S. commercial airlines. But, how is UTC positioned differently in '09?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "You know, Deane, I'd love to get into '09 discussion, but unfortunately I think it's just a little bit premature. I'll let you, you know, we were targeting 10% plus growth as we said in the intro comments and then in the release. Obviously, commercial aero, a challenging environment and that becomes more difficult. But, I think we feel pretty good about the prospects for next year and as this year comes to a close and we see what really happens with the airlines, what happens with oil I think we will have a better feel for it. But, I'll tell you right now; we've got confidence we can continue to grow earnings no matter what the environment is.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "If I ask it this way, could you tell us what the economics are as you today have... you are powered by the hour contracts, what you can do in terms of expense control and management there, and what the offset might be? Just conceptually not looking for a P&L impact.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "You know, about 40% of Pratt's aftermarket is FMP or powered by the hour type contracts is the similar number at Hamilton. So, obviously those contracts are revenues dossiers with those logarithm based upon flight hours as opposed to RPM. So, planes are still flying and revenues still is pretty good there.", "In terms of cost control I think is just back to the UTC flavor. We are going to take cost out where we can or we are trying to increase productivity, use the ACE operating system to improve back office as well as factory productivity. And it's just... it's going to be the basic flavor Deane. I can't give you a lot of specifics unfortunately, but we are confident as we look forward.", "Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from George Shapiro with Citi. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Yes, good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hi, George.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Couple of quick ones. The revenue increase at Otis and Fire & Security, is that all just reflecting your currency change or is there some... is there actually some organic increase that you are seeing?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "George, at Otis, about half of the revenue increase or half of the 19% approximately was currency, so about 10% organic growth there. In case of Fire & $security, about 4% organic growth?", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "No, what I mean is the increased revenue guidance that you provided for the year, is that all currency-related or is it also some organic?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "It's a combination of the two. There is some currency in there, but there is a lot of operating performance both in Otis and Fire & Safety.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Okay. And then, if we look at the Hamilton Sundstrand, you mentioned small, spares up mid single-digit but the whole aftermarket up double-digits. What's the mix there between the maintenance business and the spares business?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well, as far as we look at Hamilton Sundstrand business, we said, commercial aftermarket was still pretty good with spares up kind of mid single-digits. The repair side was actually up almost 20% in the quarter. And we continue to see good input into the shops, which is actually, I think a good indicator as we go forward that the aerospace business is not perhaps in this dire straits as people might have thought. The input in the shops, and we actually saw the same thing at Pratt & Whitney, where we saw better inductions in the second quarter than the first quarter into the engine shops. Though again unfortunately, the problem with the repair operations is its much lower margin from what we see on spares, still indicative of a pretty robust market out there.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "And Greg, what's the rough mix between the two in the aftermarket?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "The spare is up; it's slightly below 50% of the commercial aero. But they are about equal.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Right, about equal.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Okay. And then just back on Otis and Carrier. I found it ironic that the order growth this quarter was actually greater than the order growth that you had detailed in the first quarter. And some of it might have been a little bit extra currency. But is there any areas that you actually saw relatively better this quarter than the first quarter, to account for that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think Europe was probably the surprise for us, where especially, Otis reached almost 40% growth in quarters, again half of that being currency, but still very strong underlying growth, as I said in France, Germany and Eastern Europe, and specifically in Russia.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Okay. And maybe one last one, Greg. In Pratt & Whitney, you've done a remarkable job of holding the margins up where they are despite zero spares growth. What... from how you look at it, what would have to happen for those margins to start to come down at Pratt & Whitney?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Obviously, if you had a significant slowdown in the spare parts sales, it is still a large percentage of Pratt & Whitney's profitability tied to spares. But as you try and size that, yes, Pratt is more than just commercial aerospace. The commercial aerospace is about $4.5 billion of Pratt's $13 billion or so of revenue. So, you'd have to have, I think, more than just commercial aerospace turned down to really see a big decline in margins at Pratt. And you've got good strength at Pratt Canada, you've got good strength in the military side, Rocketdyne is doing well. And it is a big well balanced company, just like UTC.", "George Shapiro - Citigroup", "Okay, very good. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much. First, could you talk for a moment a little bit about Sikorsky, some progress but still maybe not the margins you would like to see and then Greg, also address the MPA, the Maritime Helicopter program please?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I guess I would, if I might take a little bit of umbrage with your first question there. I think actually, it was our pretty good performance that was supposed to be this quarter where they delivered 53 helicopters, that's up from 30 in the first quarter. They saw 120 basis points of margin expansions, 8.5%. So it's good performance. Is it where we want them to be ultimately? Absolutely not. There's still room to go there. We've talked and Jeff has talked about double-digit business here in the next couple of years, next three years I guess. But they are making progress.", "We're still committed. Jeff and team are still committed to deliver over 200 large helicopters this year. There is more than just I would tell you the helicopter deliveries. That's about half of their revenue. Now they're also doing well in the development side with the CH-53 and some of their other big programs. So that's a very good quarter and again it's just indication that they are on the right track and they are on the right trajectory for this year and into the future.", "As far as the Canadian Maritime program, I don't have a much of an update other than to say that, we're working very closely with the Canadian government. We will be late with the helicopter as we've talked about before, probably up to 24 months late at this time.", "We're working closely though to make sure that the helicopter meets the requirements of the Canadian government, both from a schedule and a cost standpoint. And at the end of the day, it's going to be the world's best search and rescue helicopter that the Canadian government is going to be buying from Sikorsky. So, we are in is, I would say back on track. Light test will happen later this year and deliveries will start probably in and around the late or 2010 I guess at this point 2011, so little late. The first helicopters will be a little more expensive, but overall for the program standpoint it's still a great program.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "No, I hear you, and that's encouraging and I appreciate that. And yes, I guess I can see, clearly move in the right direction. You didn't talk about industrial and Hamilton Sundtrand. My guess is elements of that business continued to be very strong and could you just talk for a moment on that and then I have one another item.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes, it was actually a very strong quarter in industrial and the revenue is up about 28%. And as we would expect, they are the businesses that are impacted by growth in China and Asia are very, very strong. So a little bit of slowdown in some of the U.S. centric construction businesses and any of the hydrocarbon processing work there, primarily Sundyne and Milton Roy. All those businesses continue be very strong. Order growth was a little less than the 20%, but still strong and I think we're going to have a pretty good year.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "And then Greg finally, one of the challenges is always trying to figure out how Fire & Security organic growth is being measured in? Could you or may be Akhil, because he is so familiar with that business, address, good hand off right. But, seriously some of the metrics, which you could talk about either customer adds or other things that you couldn't point to whether there is organic growth?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "I said both good growth Howard in the Fire & Safety side of the business. As you recall, Fire Safety is about twp-thirds of 60% of the total revenue base for Fire & Security and that grew in mid single-digit, which was good to see both in North America and Europe. In fact inside of North America, the reservation business which we had talked about last time in first quarter, is being down 30%, was down 16% this quarter as well, yet the overall Fire Safety business in North America grew mid single-digit. So, very encouraged with all the focus and effort that Bill and team are putting on the organic growth side. Security EMEA, which... it was a little bit down also in first quarter, is about up low single-digit. So again, encouraging times there. I think the team is focusing on organic growth and hopefully, we will report better numbers going forward on that.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you, gentlemen.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thank you, Howard.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Joe Campbell with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers", "Hi. Good morning, Greg, Jim and Akhil.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Hi Joe.", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Hi Joe.", "Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers", "Could you just... I have just two things. One, as you've given us a lot of information, most of which is reasonably constructive about order rates in the various businesses in the various global market. But rather than kind of business-wise, is it possible to keep together sort of Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, China and so on. Just kind of go around the world. I am struck for example that you've got such strength in Otis, but then you are off to a slow cooling market in Europe and then you've got weak refrigeration. Is there a way that's kind of pull this together region-by-region so that we can see whether your views of what seems to be going on taking in a aggregate is really that different from what we read in papers and so on.", "And then the second question I just give it to you right now, is whether or not we think we can, you know can we achieve kind of 10% margin in Fire & Security, are we backing off from that strength in the revenue growth?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Okay. Let me start Joe on the kind of the geographical overview, if you will. I think there is any surprise as we look at the... where we were strong and where there is a little bit slowness. As you think about the U.S. overall from the UTC perspective now, growth there is kind of mid single-digits in terms of revenues for the quarter. And obviously, the weakness in the U.S. residential market is a big piece of that slow down. I think we actually saw some encouraging signs I think in the residential market today where housing starts actually were up in June and Carrier's resi business is actually getting a little bit of traction, I would tell you in a down market, mostly on the back of cost reduction.", "But, the U.S. kind of mid single-digit growth, it was the slowest growing area around the world. Europe, I think may be that's the surprise to everybody here. Again, we saw very strong growth at Otis as well as Carrier. I think that is mostly I would say France, Germany and Eastern Europe. There is a still have lot of slowness in the UK, Spain, Italy also in the cooling market as well as the elevator business. So, again no surprises, I think it coincides pretty well with what you guys probably see in the paper.", "Asia; yes, very, very strong; I am talking about double-digit growth there. And you know I had to differentiate. China, continues, more than 20% kind go growth rates across our businesses in China. Japan that slow, Korea is slow but Asia in general and total including India, up strong double-digits. So, nothing to do with the economy here in terms of what we are seeing versus what you are reading, it is just that we have been very successful in those markets that are expanding especially in the emerging markets.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Joe, on Fire & Security, you will see very strong profit growth for the year, but I think 10% of margin will come up just shy of that. And there is no shame in being a little bit short at 10% margins for the year. We wanted to sell and announce the sale of some of the low margin, man guarding businesses. But the valuation wasn't fair in the tough markets. We've decided to retain some of those business and they have margins that are low to mid single-digits. So, it just dilutes the margin. But you still get the same earnings growth that we talked about early in the year and actually with the more with the foreign exchange.", "Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers", "So Jim, that change in the resulting margin, the earlier guidance assumed that you will be able to get rid of some of those. And so, really the business is a stronger extract rather than weaker and it's just some of them, if I understand it correctly, that's up pulling the average margin down?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Joe, you said it better than I said it.", "Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers", "I know I did. All right, thanks so much, Jim. Thanks guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. So, Otis margins 19% to 20% I think that's a record up 19% year-on-year. So it's last year was mix is offsetting the top line growth and that's keeping the margin leverage below trend. But we have not seen that now. I am just wondering, are we starting to see the impact of operating leverage on the volume growth offsetting that mix impact and may be if you could just comment on what the OE margin is doing right now?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Nigel, firstly, the mix in the quarter was not... did not change unfavorably and that's because the service revenues grew at almost as fast as the OEM revenues grew for the quarter. That was certainly not a headwind as we've talked about in the past.", "The second thing is, we truly are seeing tremendous operating leverage with high volumes in OEMs, our product cost reduction actions, and other cost actions that Harry and now the EA and team are taking in Otis. It's just great execution there. And we're seeing the benefits of OEM margins expanding, and the mix really not changing, as service revenues grow about at the same rate as OEM.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. I am surprised that service revenues grew at the same level as the OEs, is that sustainable?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Yes, keep in the mind that Europe is where we have a larger proportion of service revenues, as a percentage of total revenues. And then we have the currency benefits in euro like we've seen, have helped the actual currency, the mix part a little bit.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, understand. And then Greg mentioned little bit of traction in the resi market is U.S., which is on your treaties, which is interesting. I just wondered if you could just expand on that. And on the pricing side for residential, obviously, you announced the price increases last quarter. Trying to see some good pricing coming through in the PPI numbers, the air conditioning, I'm just wondering are you seeing that pricing actions sticking?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Let me start firstly maybe on the overall market. We saw some preliminary statistics which would say that the market was down about 9% or 10%, as overall split systems market in the U.S. in the second quarter, preliminary numbers. Our revenues were about flat year-over-year. So, that would tell us that we're gaining a little bit of traction in the market. Actually, continuing the trend that we saw in the first quarter. So, again, I think they're addressing some of the concerns that were out there in distribution and in the cost side, and they're doing a lot of things to try and take back a little bit of share, that's been going quite well.", "As far as the pricing, we did announce a price increase last month, which is effective actually July 15th. And we're getting a little bit of traction with pricing, which is good news. I think you've seen pricing from the competitors as well. But, in this environment where we see input cost going up, we're actually getting I would say better pricing than we have historically seen in that side.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just one final one, I think you talked about some gains of certain restructuring [ph] in the second half for the year. Can you just give us a little bit more color on that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "So, we're got few gains, although I can't give you a specific number on them today. We've got a small business that Pratt just disclosed here in the beginning of the third quarter, which will generate a small gain. We've also working on a tax settlement related to 2003. I can't really be very specific, because I just don't have that finalized yet with our friends at the Internal Revenue Service. But we expect that will be resolved by the end of the year. We expected that will... there'll be a fairly sizable reversal there, but I just can't give you a specific number on it.", "What I do know is that restructuring is going to be very strong in the back half of the year. Obviously, we've got $130 million so far, we see at least another $170 million, and the gains could be up to that level or may be even a little higher. We'll have to just wait and see what happens.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay and then just... I was a little surprised that the Pratt restructuring wasn't a little bit higher given that's where a lot of the pressure is going to felt in '09, I presume. Can you just maybe comment on that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think as always, I think all the units, our team out there restructuring as they think about 2009 and Pratt certainly has been focused on this and I think as you go into the third quarter, the $170 million that we just mentioned, you will see Pratt be a fairly large participant in that pool.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks Greg.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Yes, thank you. It looks like if you kind of hit your target that you'll see a pickup in commercial helicopter deliveries in the second half and I believe those are of lower margins than the military. Can you improve your margins at Sikorsky from where you were in the second quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yeah, obviously, Cai. I think we saw a very good progress, 120 basis points. I think we'll continue to see margin traction there throughout the year, I am not going to say 120 basis points, but we should... we need to see costs come down especially on the helicopter production line. Hours have to continue to come down. They have to come down not just from a cost standpoint, but also from the delivery standpoint so that we have the capacity to deliver these 120 helicopters or so in the second half.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "So sequentially, you should be able to improve the margin from the 8.5 year-over-year obviously for the fourth quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Yes, I think that's right.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay, great. And then could you give us the number of industrial gas turbines that you shipped in the quarter and give us some color that market appears to be relatively strong. Talk about order intake, what you expect for the year and the kind of momentum you might have going forward?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well, we actually shipped about 20 of the industrial gas turbines. That's actually up 100% from what we saw last year in the second quarter and that market continues to be very robust around the globe as people are looking for the peaking engine standby energy. Now that we have, I'm just looking to, here you will see we have the order intake for industrial. It's not, may be we can get that... we'll get back to you with a call if that will be helpful.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "And then what do you expect to do... what's the plans for the years?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I don't know, but I have a forecast for the year for industrial gas turbine shipment. Again, what I will do is I will ask Akhil or Maria to try and get that data for you.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And then the last one, Greg. You mentioned that the non-recurring gains in the second half could equal or exceed the $170 million, which means, as opposed to being a headwind though; $128 million in the first half restructuring would be essentially neutralized in the second half to the extent kind of business goes well. What's your information in term like if you have a figure of non-referring game? What's your information in terms of even pushing that restructuring higher, because you really implying at the time and the run rates where you were in the second quarter versus letting more in your earnings, so?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I think as you think about the year 2008, we've taken the guidance up to at the top end about 495 and we've contemplated in that the restructuring up to $300 million. I would tell you, given what we see for '09 today, I would suspect that we would probably want to do more restructuring as opposed to flowing it through the earnings at this point. And I think we saw that here in the first half of the year and I think we will have that point broken in the second half of the year is if there is appetite for restructuring, we want to make investments for the long-term here. We are going to do what's right for the business over the long term.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And the last one in terms of the timing of the non-recurring item, can you give us an instance if it's like a 150 or kind of whatever is, what are the key items which could attribute to that and when might be all in the third and fourth quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "You know Cai, really, again we've got one small gain that we know it's already close to in the third quarter, Pratt disposition. But in terms of the larger gain as it relates to the tax or few of the other things that we are working on, I can't tell you whether that's third quarter or fourth quarter today. I will certainly let you know as we know about those things. So, there is no surprises here.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "But it should be one big lump in the third or the fourth?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Well, yes, it could be one big lump or it could be some other things as well. I just can't give you a specific in terms of timing today.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "I just chose to look on the industrial gas turbine forecast, I think, that's, you've had about 35 shipped in the first and second quarter. And we had full year forecast is between 55 and 60.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks, Cai.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chris Edwards with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Chris Edwards - J.P. Morgan", "Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks, Chris.", "Chris Edwards - J.P. Morgan", "Joe wanting me to say hi too. He's on the flight back.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Hi.", "Chris Edwards - J.P. Morgan", "Just a couple of quick questions, because most of mine have been answered. You referred earlier to some of the capacity reduction announcements that the airlines have announced. And a lot of those planes are... had engines MD-80s, and we were just curious to see what percentage of the Pratt installed base, you expect might be parked over the next year or so?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Look Chris, I don't know that I would have a percentage. As you think about the announcements that have happened so far, I think American has talked about taking 50 or 60 MD-80s and reducing that capacity here in the third or fourth quarter. I mean, the bigger capacity reductions actually been announced I believe at United, where they are talking about taking old 737s which were actually CFM powered as opposed to the Pratt powered aircraft.", "As you think about Pratt's aftermarket, commercial aftermarket is about $3.5 billion. We've given these numbers before, about 10% of that is kind of the older model engine JT8s, the JT9s. And, I think what's important is to keep it in perspective is, five years ago that business was about double the size it is today. So, we've already seen a fairly large reduction in spare sales related to the older model. So, again, there could be some further capacity reductions beyond which has been announced and it is painful to the extent it impacts spares. But it's not catastrophic in any way. I think it's just something we'll have to manage with Pratt.", "Chris Edwards - J.P. Morgan", "Right. No, that sounds good. Thank you. And then shifting gears a little bit, commercial refrigeration has been relatively weaker in the first half of the year. How do you think about that going forward for the rest of the year, and maybe into next year?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "In terms of commercial refrigeration, we have seen some weakness both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. Again, that's really more retail spending related so I don't know that I'd call a rebound in that market in the near term. I think again, it will depend upon what happens in the U.S. economy as well as the broader European economy. It position still well.", "Chris Edwards - J.P. Morgan", "Is that refrigeration weakness where it probably, can it be kind of like the store based sort of products and containers or is it more one or the other?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Yes, I think what Greg was talking about is more of the display kits business, which is the store based product as you are calling it.", "Chris Edwards - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. But container remains good?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Actually, container was down in the quarter. We actually saw the weakness in the container shipments for the quarter versus last year. Again, inside the call that we look at the containers are pretty lumpy business. So, a down in the quarter but I think for the year we're still pretty optimistic that containers are going to come back.", "Chris Edwards - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then you've spoken about I guess truck trailer before, how was that going in the U.S. and Europe?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "The U.S. truck trailer has been very strong; come back quite a bit from last year's depressed levels. So we're seeing good growth there. Europe has actually started to moderate and that's, it has a bigger business in the U.S. truck trailer. It is also very profitable business. So, that is... that was actually down a little bit in the quarter.", "Chris Edwards - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Good morning.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Hi,Doug.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "On commercial construction and I'd say both Otis and Carrier commercial. When you talked about the growth you are seeing in orders, can you characterize that versus market growth and obviously that depends on geography, but I am trying to understand, are you seeing growth in the market or you are capturing share gain?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Hi Doug, this is Jim. I think we are seeing both, I think we are seeing the market continues to grow, I think we have good products both with Gen2 at Otis and some of the Carrier commercial projects, products allowing us to take share gain. I would note as we talked a lot about it this morning though that, we had good backlog growth and particularly Otis have been given pricing in this market, we have being executing, probably the reason why you see higher margins. But as we look for architectural billings are down and we have seen a little bit lower quoting activity. And that usually precedes orders. So, I think we had very good backlog growth. I don't think we are going to sustain is very high growth rates, the backlog growth rates into the future.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "And what I was getting at is outside of the U.S. are you able to compensate some for any slowing we may see by some share gain in some of these other markets?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "I think one have to see, but to date we had both. We've had growing share in robust markets.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "And then on Fire & Security, you talked about organic growth and the FX effect. Could you talk a little bit more specifically about the part, the piece that acquisition and non-organic part of this and then what the actions you're taking that lead the restructuring charges? In other words, what are you doing there that's leading to probably substantial restructuring charges?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "With regard to acquisition actually, both questions are related to some extend because the acquisitions of Initial, which we've announced in the third quarter of last year is driving part of the restructuring charges as well. And what is happening there is that was more of a density play. If we recall, we had a position in UK, France, and Netherlands and that initial coming on top of that it gives us an opportunity to try same the combined revenue to a lower infrastructure in terms of lower number of branches, head office et cetera. And so that's driving some other restructuring.", "The integration of Initial is going very, very well. We seem to be on track with that and that's part of the reason why Bill is expecting some margin expansion in the second half at the rate larger than what you seen thus far. The other acquisition of significance was Marioff, which was fourth quarter last year and again the order rate there continued to be very strong. The business is doing extremely well and we're very, very happy with those plays were made in Fire & Security.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "So when you look forward and you talked about 10% margin this year, and I was assuming that that was 10% including restructuring before. Are you on the track for something like that and then when you look long-term at the 15% goal that you're described, is that all pretty much intact or long-term could it even be stronger given what you've done?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Its very much on track is what I would say Doug at this point. I think when we did half margin guidance; it's always adjusted for restructuring costs. Certainly, we have benefit of restructuring in those guidance number and that continues to be the reason why we feel they have a good path to get through with the 15%.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, good. All right, thank you.", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "One more question.", "Operator", "And due to time restraints, our final question comes from the Lee Rowling [ph] from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Good morning, Lee.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Nice quarter. Just a few questions. Can you talk about your new equipment order growth and taking us in dollars, could you characterize that in units overall and I think you stated as 40% in Europe. Did you have that for us?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "It's tough to talk about unit Lee, only because unit is made up of so many different sizes and types and performance, it becomes difficult for us to characterize that. But clearly the way to look at it is the FX which we talked about, 50% of the 40% is roughly FX. If you adjust for that, at constant currency they are about 19%, 20%. And I think on a unit basis, again, Otis placed very well in the higher end. So, the dollars per unit per for Otis wins are typically larger than the market in some cases. So... but, to give you an exact number on units, that's tough for us to do.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Fair enough. And then in the U.S., could you tell us just may be regionally where the strength is coming from and maybe in Europe, maybe country-by-country for Otis?", "Akhil Johri - Vice President, Investor Relations", "As Europe is easier to talk about, let me start with that I think that one is more I think as Greg said, France certainly for Otis has been strength in France, Germany, Eastern Europe particularly Russia. Weaknesses on the other hand have been basically you said to some extend Italy and Spain for a smaller extend. With regard to U.S., I think that's a little something maybe I can take it later on on the call, I'll talk to you about that.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "They will try and get you some more detail here but we'd be on the call.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. I mean just to switch it up a bit, I know for going into power on, I think Hamilton had a few outstanding items that were necessary as to be complete for power on, just so wondering could you give us an update there and just what's going on with the program, what you guys are working on, I mean any surprises positive or negative?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "I wouldn't characterize any... that we had any real surprises at the development program. So, you always have things that you may have to reward is part of the process. But I would tell you the power on process from a Hamilton perspective was good as we could have ever expected. And we are obviously supporting First Flight certification hardware. We've got a couple of outstanding items there. I expect all of that will be done by the end of this month, end of July, to support First Flight or support won't happen until some time towards the end of the year. So, feel very good about the program. I think Dave Hess and team and Tim Morris, they all have done just a great job supporting Boeing through this very long and difficult development process. But they are not done yet, and still spending money but I feel also very good about the program.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. What are the systems that are outstanding for First Flight?", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Again Lee, I don't know that I have those specifics. I know again a lot of it has to do with the certification of software and the start primarily going to be related to electric power distribution systems. But I'm sure there is more kind of mix and matchs that has to be completed as well. I just don't have it on hand for you here.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Sure. And then, I think Nicole asked about an update on Diebold. I don't remember the answer, the question being addressed. So, if you did, I apologize for it, could you give us some update there?", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "Yeah. Actually, I will give an update, I did speak about and about 15 minutes ago and actually my response is going to be similar to what it was 15 minutes ago but, the same...", "Unidentified Analyst", "I apologize.", "James E. Geisler - Vice President, Finance", "That's all right. I was going to say actually the response will be the same as it was an hour ago and it was four months ago, which is, we really like the property. But, it's not a must have, there are other opportunities in the world and we will have to see how it goes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - Vice President, Accounting and Finance", "Thanks, Lee. Okay. Well, just want to thank everybody for dialing in and listening in this morning. Obviously, a very strong quarter, and we've got a lot of confidence in the year. The focus right now as we've mentioned many times on this call is about preparing for '09, given there'll be economic uncertainties we all face. But, I feel very good about where we are, we've got great products, great people and think we're going to have a great year.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's home page. at www.utc.com.", "The company reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Gregory Hayes", "Good morning everyone. As we've said many times over the past few months, we are certainly living in interesting times. As we read the headlines every morning there seems to be little if any good news and market demand is changing daily, normally not in a positive direction.", "At UTC, we're not immune from the market forces, but we are I believe, uniquely prepared and positioned to outperform in these difficult times. If you saw the press release this morning, UTC closed out a strong 2008. Our full year revenues were just under $59 billion, up 7% year over year. Earnings per share were $4.90, up 15% versus 2007.", "Cash flow, very strong, 105% of net income. But despite the world wide economic slowdown, we continue to make investments in the long term growth of this business and to reduce costs engineering the development spending total of $1.8 billion last year. That's up nearly $100 million over 2007.", "We also continued our aggressive restructuring actions preparing for tougher times ahead. Total restructuring expenditures was $357 million, strong evidence I believe that UTC can continue to outperform.", "We began 2008 with most markets in a relatively good position with the exception of the U.S. residential market. Early concerns about commercial construction slow down in the U.S. and Western Europe ended of course in the broad based slowdowns across all industries and geographies.", "The net rate of decline accelerated in those end markets in the last couple of months and combined with a strong U.S. dollar, has created unique challenges with global businesses. Despite this, UTC reported fourth quarter EPS at $1.23. That's up 14% over last year.", "Foreign exchange translation combined with Canada's currency hedging adversely impacted UTC by $0.06. Third quarter results also includes $0.06 net benefit of one time gains of excess of restructuring costs. Last year's quarter had a net $0.04 charge for restructuring and other costs in excess of gains. S&G impact of these items, results for both quarters, EPS was up 4%.", "Revenues were $14.5 billion in the quarter, a 1% decline versus a year ago. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by $700 million or 5%. Organic growth was 3%. You see that once again the balance works for UTC.", "Sikorsky was the highlight in the quarter with 25% organic revenue growth, delivering 204 large helicopters through the year, a 17% increase from 2007 consistent with its commitment of delivering more than 200 aircraft a year. On the other hand, our short cycle businesses, [inaudible] carried organic revenues declined by 7%.", "First quarter order rates indicate that revenues will decline at a faster rate in the first half of 2009. In addition to the weaknesses anticipated in the developed regions of the world, we also saw slowdowns in China, Russia and other emerging economies. ", "Otis new equipment orders declined 14% globally including the impact of foreign currency. Carrier's commercial HVAC equipment orders declined 7% worldwide, also including the impact of CapEx. As discussed at the investor meeting back in December Otis transport refrigeration orders declined over 50% in the quarter.", "Now turning to aerospace, Pratt & Whitney booked a bill for large commercial spares was just below one and a quarter. Commercial spares revenues were down just slightly. Hamilton Sundstrand commercials spares book to bill on the hand was just above normal. ", "While the business environment is challenging, we continue to focus on taking out costs through restructuring. We spent $136 million on restructuring in the quarter and as I noted before, a total of $357 million for the year.", "Aggressive cost control and benefits from early restructuring led to market expansion of four of the six business units adjusting for restructuring of one time gains. As Akhil will talk about in a minute, Otis margins were down in the quarter but would have been up slightly except for accounting adjustments related to a subsidiary.", "Cash flow in the quarter was strong as I noted, with free cash flow at 147% net income, a result of seasonal inventory reductions and to strong collections. We repurchased $690 million of our shares in the quarter bringing the year to date total to $3.2 billion. I should also note that we contributed $250 million of our stock to our pension plan in December.", "In 2009 we will begin targeting share repurchase and acquisition at $2 billion each, although we will be opportunistic and we may adjust these targets just as we did in 2008. ", "Acquisitions ending the quarter was $724 million including [inaudible]. This was primarily a carrier and fire and security consistent with our strategy in expanding our presence and service installation markets.", "As we've said many times, liquidity is not an issue at UTC. In December, we successfully issued $1.25 billion of debt at a coupon rate of just over 6%, evidence that the debt markets are functioning for companies with good fundamentals and strong cash flows. With about $1 billion of debt maturing in 2009 and look back at the December offering, we have announced early redemption of $500 million to take advantage of the slight interest rate differential.", "We'll come back and talk about 2009, but for now, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business units.", "Akhil Johri", "Before I get into the business unit performance, let me talk about the non recurring items in the quarter. As shown on Page 3 of the web cast, we had about $0.10 of one time gain generated by sale of certain investments and businesses. These gains were offset by comparable amounts of restructuring charges.", "In addition, the IRS supplement gain during the quarter has a pre tax equivalent of about $100 million as anticipated. This settlement met the discrete taxes on the one time gain added $0.06 earnings per share.", "Turning to Page 4, let me remind you that our Otis segment results adjusted for restructuring and the non recurring items that I just implied. At Otis, revenues in the quarter were down 3% and operating profit was down 7% including the untypical impact of foreign exchange compensation which accounted for approximately seven points of decline in both revenue and profit.", "Operating profits were also negatively impacted by approximately $30 million of provision of inventory and other account balances which occurred over several years at the Otis facility in Brazil. These adjustments resulted from an investigation initiated by Otis headquarters. ", "At constant currency, revenues increased 4% driven by high service sales globally. New equipment sales increased in North America and Europe but were partially offset by a high single digit decline in Asia driven by the postponement by over 5,000 units in China typically from the slowdown in the residential housing market.", "Excluding currency and the provisions related to the Brazil activity, profits grew 5%, had higher volume, increased installation efficiencies and continued cost containment more than offset the higher steel and [inaudible] costs. For the full year, Otis revenues were up 10% and operating profits were up 12%. Margins expanded by 30 basis points to 19.3%.", "As anticipated, the global financial crisis has begun to adversely impact commercial construction markets. As Greg said new equipment orders that focused declines were 14% including the impact of currency translation and 8% in the quarter at constant currency.  Asia including utilities was flat, America's down by single digits and Europe down high teens. ", "We expect continued softness in new equipment sales until governments world wide begin to have an impact. Although the backdrop remains strong, up 9% versus the prior year, including the impact of foreign currency compensation and 12% at constant currency.", "Turning to Carrier, as commented at the December investor meeting, Carrier's fourth quarter operating profit increased 42% on 15% lower revenues. Operating margins are on track for more than 200 basis points. Foreign currency compensation contributed about six points of the revenue decline and five points of the profit decline in the quarter.", "In addition, about half of the EBIT and margin drop in the quarter came from the impact of the market currency changes on constant transactions.  Revenues at the refrigeration business were down high single digits, in Europe, down double digits. The U.S. residential business was down high single digits in a tough market, shipments outperformed the industry.", "Commercial UTC business was up low single digits all from acquisitions, strong earnings and margin expansion. For the year Carrier earnings were flat on 2% revenue growth. Approximately $150 million on benefits from restructuring and other cost reduction actions offset the adverse impact of commodity headwinds and unfavorable mix.", "The slowing global economy has had an immediate impact on shop type of businesses and as Greg mentioned we are also seeing a slowdown in commercial HVAC order rates as well as significant declines in refrigeration orders. This half for Carrier will be very challenging given the weak end markets and stronger U.S. dollar.", "On Slide 6, UTC Fire and Security provided strong performance in the quarter despite significant headwind. Our revenue growth of 3% was more than offset by two points of negative impact from productivity initiatives along with four points of unfavorable foreign exchange translation. Fire and Security organic growth was high single digit growth in Europe and Asia.", "Operating profit and Fire and Security increased 5% or $9 million. Fire organic revenue along with the benefits of restructuring, integration and continuing productivity initiatives generated approximately 21% profit growth. Foreign exchange translation adversely impacted profits at 16% in the quarter. Operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 11.8%. ", "Fire and Security delivered profit growth of 26% on a revenue increase of 4%, resulting in 100 basis points of margin expansion for the year, organic revenue and operating profit growth of 15% and 18% respectively.", "Turning to the Aerospace segment on Slide 7, Pratt & Whitney revenues increased 3% in the quarter. Over 10% growth in commercial engines revenue from higher shipments and after market services was partially offset by lower development revenues and engine delivery. Canada revenue was about flat as higher engine shipments offset weaker after market sales.", "Commercial engine sales were down slightly in the quarter. Fourth quarter commercial sales included the benefit from the previously announced Pratt & Whitney distribution agreement. ", "Operating profit improved 80% in the quarter on bigger commercial engine mix and after market performance, lower net commodity headwinds and a favorable adjustment of $0.02 through our commercial engine program. This increase was partially offset by lower military engine orders. E&D was essentially flat in the quarter and lower than expected efficiencies and changes in program timing. ", "For the full year Pratt & Whitney operating profit grew 9% on 7% higher revenues. Pratt & Whitney Canada shipped 4,000 engines in 2008, up 34% over 2007. In the quarter revenues were up 3% with solid organic growth of 6%. On an organic basis, aerospace OEM revenues were up high teens, industrial businesses were up mid single digits and aerospace after market revenues were down high single digits.", "Commercial stage revenue was down mid single digits in the quarter [inaudible]. Orders for the industrial businesses were down 16.", "Operating profit grew 14% primarily from high volumes and mix both in the OEM and industrial businesses from sharp performance and favorable adjustment growth about a penny toward acquisition related liability. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower after market revenues. Operating margin at 19% was up 180 basis points from fourth quarter of 2007. ", "For the full year Pratt & Whitney increased revenues 10% and delivered on its guidance of $100 million operating profit growth.", "At Sikorsky on Slide 9 operating profit grew 38% on 25% higher revenues. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 54 large helicopters; 38 based on military platforms and 26 commercial. As Greg mentioned before, Sikorsky met its 2008 commitment of 200 plus deliveries with a total of 240 shipments for the year.", "Operating margin expanded 90 basis points in the quarter to 9.5% from higher helicopter shipments. For the full year, gross operating margin of 8.9% reflects a 120 basis point improvement from 2007 and is on tract to meet the target of 10% operating margin by 2010.", "During the quarter, Sikorsky also achieved the first flight for the Canadian made helicopter and executed an agreement and successfully base lined the program. This will be the most sophisticated maritime helicopter in the world and first delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2010.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Greg to wrap up.", "Gregory Hayes", "I'll spend a minute here on 2008 before we get to 2009 because I think it's important to focus on what a good year 2008 really was for UTC. Despite the deteriorating economic conditions, earnings per share were up 15% over 2007 to $2.90 a share and revenues ended the year just under $59 billion, up 7% over 2007 with five full point's organic growth.", "Free cash flow was $4.9 billion or 105%. On ACE, our operating system, we reached 49% ACE gold and silver sites across the business at year end 2008 and we're confident we can meet Louis targeted 70% growth ACE gold and silver sites by the end of 2009.", "We're also making progress in rolling out ACE to our supply base. Recall that this past December we set another goal at 70% of our use supplier stats ACE gold performing levels at the end of the year 2011. Business unit presidents will provide an update on both our internal and supplier basis initiatives at our February 24 investor meeting.", "2008 was also an exciting year for product innovations and accomplishments. Pratt & Whitney has continued testing its PurePower gear engine which based on testing to date is expected to achieve 12% reduction in fuel consumption and 55% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions, 50% in engine noise versus today's engines.", "At Sikorsky beside the Canadian Maritime, the revolutionary twin motor X2 technology demonstrator achieve first flight in August in further flight is expected to demonstrate that the helicopter can cruise comfortable at 250 knots while retaining excellent velocity handling and efficient hovering capacity.", "At Carrier and Otis, their energy efficient products performed flawlessly. As noted earlier, we continue to invest in the future, spending $1.8 billion on engineering and development and 2009 will be no different. We continue to invest in the business and spend another $1.8 billion.", "Let's talk about 2009 for a couple of minutes. In December, Louis provided EPS guidance range for 2009 of $4.65 to $5.15 plus or minus 5%, leaving acquisition related costs or implementation of FAS141(NYSE:R). We're reaffirming that full year guidance today.", "We also want to point out a couple of developments since December that has put pressure on the high end of the range. First, expansion expense. As expansion expense headwinds increases compared to our guidance. Discount rates came down from 7% in early December to 6.1% at December 31. Although our investment performance was slightly better than anticipated, the resulting impact of the sharp discount rate moves the incremental pension expense was about $125 million on top of the $100 million already contemplated in our guidance. As a result, we're now anticipating making a $400 million contribution to our U.S. pension plans in 2009.", "Also since early December, end market conditions have clearly deteriorated for all businesses. The order rates we mentioned earlier have put more pressure on Carrier's outlook. Otis has also seen pressure from projects, particularly in virgin markets. On the aerospace side, while there is optimism that the world's commercial airlines will be profitable in 2009, due to lower jet fuel prices, global air traffic may be down 3% to 4% versus the range of plus or minus 1% we anticipated in December.", "The business jet market is also weakening with fewer departures, reduced OEM order rates and more pressure with Pratt & Whitney Canada. In response to this, we've accelerated our restructuring plans. We now anticipate $150 million restructured financing in the first quarter, with about $50 million of that offset by gains.", "UTC's leadership team is working aggressively to initiate additional cost reductions beyond that of cost of businesses to right size each of our businesses for this challenging environment. You'll be hearing more about specific business unit actions at our February investor meeting.", "Just a few words on currency impacts, we provided a 2009 guidance, we mentioned an adverse impact than the stronger U.S. dollar was expected to have on UTC's revenue and earnings. About $600 million of earnings was half of that from the Euro decline alone. And of course the first half of 2009 will see a disproportionate impact on the average year over 2008 where $1.49 to the dollar in the first quarter to $1.56 in the second quarter, the rates that we've seen over the last several months", "As a result of these adverse FX compares under market conditions and the $100 million of restructuring in excess of gains, we expect first half results to be below the bottom end of the full year range, plus or minus 5%. We continue to watch all of these trends carefully. Based on the extensive global efforts underway today, we still expect a modest recovery in the later part of 2009.", "As for our normal practice at the February meeting, the business unit presidents will update you on market conditions, strategy and cost related actions. ", "What you've come to expect from UTC, our ACE operating business restructuring expertise and experienced management team will allow the company to navigate through these turbulent times. Doing more with less is the way of thinking at UTC that has consistently delivered market leading results.", "Operating discipline, market leading franchise, balanced global presence gives us confidence in the future to help us continue to outperform even in these uncertain times. We'll stop there and open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "It was hard to hear you. Could you just restate what the size of the Brazilian adjustment was in the quarter and then with respect to the call on the backlog at Otis, I think you alluded to in your comments on the fourth quarter and '09 some push up in emerging markets. Did you have any cancellations in the U.S.? And then maybe give us a sense of the comfort level/visibility with the backlog and did you have any emerging market cancellations or push ups that you think become cancellations.", "Gregory Hayes", "Let's start with the Otis Brazil. That was about $0.02 in the quarter. That is behind us we believe. It was one of things that unfortunately happen in a business with about 5,000 people, but about $0.02 in the quarter. Obviously we adjust out for that. Otis's part was up slightly two point basis.", "As for new equipment backlog and orders, we did not see any significant cancellations in any of the business or in any of the regions, but we did see significant deferrals, especially in China, also in Russia. The emerging markets were probably hardest hit and I think the biggest surprise to us as well looked at this, was over 5,000 units and China was deferred out of 2008. Not cancelled, just deferred. ", "So backlog is still up there about 9% for Otis for the year so we still think that 2009 will be a good year. We expect revenues to be up at Otis again for new equipment, but obviously these challenging times are putting some pressure on that. I think you should also remember, I already mentioned the fact that some of these issues in China are probably of our own making as we tried to avoid extending credit to some of our agents there so a few of our orders were actually deferred at our request because we didn't want to take additional credit risk. But the market did slow in China.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Do you have the split between service and equipment revenue growth at Otis in the quarter? You might have given it. And then with respect to just the nature of deferrals actually moving into cancellations, maybe give us a sense of the comfort level of sustained deferrals or moving into cancellations as we go through 2009.", "Akhil Johri", "With regard to the growth rate for both service and new equipment service grew mid to high single digits between 6% and 7%. As the new equipment orders between 2% and 3% and that's the first part. The second part, I don't think we have really seen any cancellations beyond normal at this point at Otis. Usually Otis does see some cancellations as part of normal business, and those are the kind of things we try to figure as Greg mentioned and I think emerging markets, we'll wait and see what happens.", "We don't think the underlying demand driven by urbanization is going to go away. Maybe it's just a matter of time as the Chinese government stimulus tax comes back in place and the residential market demand expands. It might take three months, six months, nine months, that's up for debate but we do expect the backlog to be as solid and come back at some point in equipment to resurface.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On the commercial business, it's probably more on the Carrier short cycle and also maybe Hamilton Sundstrand Industrial, how would you characterize the inventory levels that are out there? I guess when you think about the massive deceleration everybody saw in November and December, could you characterize where you think the inventory levels are out at the customer?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think on Carrier specifically when you take a look at channel inventory, channel inventories are down in line with the markets. We don't think there's any big inventory overhang out there and not a tremendous amounts to bleed down. On the industrial side at Hamilton, orders were down to low double digits there. Most of that was on the pressure side. ", "We're still seeing good order growth at Sun dyne, especially in the oil and gas industry, but I would say on the compressor side we expect pretty slow growth here in the first half. Definitely the view on inventory out there we do see order rates coming down pretty significantly at Solaire.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "What would you say specifically on the first half? Was it that EPS would be below the bottom end of the full year range meaning below 5% down?", "Gregory Hayes", "That's exactly what I was trying to get across. 5% is the full year range at the bottom end. Clearly first half is going to be below 5% at best.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "I guess you're maintaining the $150 million restructuring placeholder but it's all in Q1. It would be unthinkable I would think that you wouldn't have any more during the rest of the year. How do we think about, what kind of incremental restructuring your EPS guidance can withstand?", "Gregory Hayes", "If you're thinking about, we've talked about $150 million of restructuring in the year assuming that was all going to be offset by gain. That is a number we started 2008. End of the year 2008 was $357 million. Right now, I can tell you we are looking actively at doing additional restructuring across most of the businesses. There was contingency at both the mid point of the range and the bottom end of the range to absorb some additional restructuring.", "I don't want to give you that number today. I'll tell you we're working hard on each of the businesses to quantify that and will give you a lot more detail when we stand up in February for each of the businesses.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "What's your early look at the gain outlook this year? I guess the $150 million, how much of that do you have kind of buckled down and are there other bigger items out there?", "Gregory Hayes", "We have visibility to as I said about $50 million here in the first quarter and these gains, they kind of pop up from unexpected places just they did in the fourth quarter where gains were a little better than we had anticipated. But right now, I think we've got a clear line of sight of $100 million to $150 million of gains, a little bit in the first half and more in the back half of the year. More than that, not much visibility.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "On the aero site, your Pratt spares were surprisingly good. They actually outperformed Hamilton which hasn't happened for awhile and given the mix a little bit surprising. I'm just wondering if you could give some color. I guess Hamilton was kind of where I thought they might be and Pratt was surprisingly good.", "Akhil Johri", "In Pratt we talked about the distributor agreement which we announced late in the third quarter. That has helped that situation a little bit so as they were down slightly on a quarterly basis, if you adjust for the pick up of the restocking at the new distributor that would be in more in line with the decline which is more consistent with the third quarter.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "So it's more like somewhere in teens?", "Akhil Johri", "No, low double digits.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "As we think forward through the next few quarters, I guess you'll only annualize that in the fourth quarter so maybe the first nine months of the year, you continue to see stocking? How do we think about that?", "Gregory Hayes", "I wouldn't actually draw that conclusion just yet. I think what we saw in the back half of 2008, especially at Pratt spares was a response to the rather significant curtailment in capacity, especially in the U.S. carriers. The spare order rates obviously are driven by RPM's and the available piles and I would hope that we've kind of stabilized now and we're going to see a run rate.", "Again, we're not predicting spares are going to be up at Pratt this year. I think it will be down a little bit but I don't think we're going to see a major decline unless we see a much bigger drop in either capacity or RPM's.", "Akhil Johri", "Keep in mind as we talked about before, the capacity reductions impact the [inaudible] more than the other engines and that has become a much smaller part of the overall Pratt stream, as it generated $50 million in 2007, more than that in 2008 compared with $1 billion that it used to be, in the last cycle like this.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "What were the Pratt Canada spares down in the quarter?", "Akhil Johri", "They were down double digits.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Campbell \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Joseph Campbell \u2013 Barclays Capital", "In the December meeting we had a slide that talked about the commercial businesses having revenues down to that operating profit growth five to six and I gather that that outlook is now worse. I wondered if you could looking at that slide or the number that we had which was basically commercial businesses offset by aerospace businesses you've now kind of said the commercial business outlook looks like its getting worse. The aerospace traffic numbers have been revised down perhaps spelling an airbus lower deliveries in 2010 which might affect shipment in the back half of the year. How does this turn now look which once upon a time was sort of 3% negative growth, a 3% positive affects and 3% negative after it affects?", "Gregory Hayes", "Let me start on the commercial segments. Clearly there's pressure on the Carrier top line here and a little bit of pressure even on the Otis top line because of the order trends that we saw in Q4. I don't know that we're ready to revise guidance on any of these businesses quite yet. I have to tell you that with only two weeks under our belt here in January, it's hard to draw any trend line.", "But clearly there's pressure on guidance on the commercial side.", "As far as on the aerospace side, as I mentioned we've got pressure there from lower RPM's and lower biz jet volume at Pratt Canada so I'd say both Carrier and Pratt are probably the most challenged as it relates to the guidance we gave just about five weeks ago. But it is early in the year so we'll watch these things another month as we get some better data points.", "Akhil Johri", "Let me just remind you I think we talked about in December; all these businesses met the guidance that we provided in December. They were clearly at the top of the range and we did say these are plans and that's why we have the [inaudible] at the range.", "Joseph Campbell \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Could you comment a bit on what the impact is at PWC, biz debts? Precisely what's the exposure there? Which models are going up and down?", "Akhil Johri", "We are still awaiting the discussions with our customers to give you a firm idea on the specific models. Obviously the 3W600 has had some stress as you would imagine. The schedule changes are still not finalized and we will have further input for you in February. But overall, you should think about $1.5 billion roughly of revenues associated with business jets for UTC out of the $57 billion to $58 billion and that's a number to keep in mind.", "Joseph Campbell \u2013 Barclays Capital", "To make sure I understand what's happening here. On all of these businesses that have constant FX have deteriorated since December, but of course those were the stretch goals. When we look at the slide that had the individual businesses, you didn't change any of them in the slides we had today. Should we expect that in March that these will get revised to reflect what we are already seeing but which you've left alone?", "Gregory Hayes", "As we said, there is pressure clearly on the Carrier end of Pratt guidance here. Frankly they were stretch goals to start with and there hasn't been a lot of good news in the Carrier markets or the Pratt markets since the December meeting. So I think there's going to be pressure on the guidance on at least those two units.", "Akhil Johri", "Just one other point. [inaudible] of action, you saw the Euro move from $1.46 to $1.29 just in the last 30 day and each Euro has a $15 million impact on our earnings. So if you recall all those things and the commodity is the other factor which is nine, obviously it is much easier to give up guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowan and Company.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowan and Company", "Can you tell us, where are you looking now for R&D in 2009 and kind of how is it still going to be up, are all the quarters up? Is there any kind of pattern we should look for there?", "Gregory Hayes", "R&D is going to be flat year over year, about $1.8 billion as I said before. I would expect you would see a little bit of a headwind at Pratt on E&D. You're also going to see a little bit of tailwind at E&D and Hamilton as the 787 program goes through first flight. But overall, I would say quarter to quarter and year over year, not any significant changes.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowan and Company", "So it will still be with a ramp and the final quarter would be the timer?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think again more consistent with what we saw in 2008 in terms of the spending profile. This all depends of course on program timing. Pratt's got some relatively big programs like the regional jet and C series. Both of those as I said earlier have some of the program timing slip a little bit to the right. We don't expect any deferrals out of 2009 so it's not a big change.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowan and Company", "You said $100 million to $150 million of gains, and the total restructuring number for the year?", "Gregory Hayes", "Right now we're still at $150 million, but as I said earlier, we're going to launch $150 million a year in the first quarter, so only about $50 million of gains. I would expect before we're done and perhaps even before the end of February you'll hear about more restructuring.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowan and Company", "As you look at the offsets between your guidance and achieving your guidance and bolstering 2010 if this goes longer as it looks like it will, where you do come out?", "Gregory Hayes", "Help me with that question one more time.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowan and Company", "If you look, clearly it looks like you're going to spend more than $150 million. It looks like you have the trade off of coming in at the absolute bottom of your range and kind of bolstering 2010 for instance, if it looks like its weaker and kind of delivering a little bit more. Where do you put the trade off in terms of where you set the restructuring?", "Gregory Hayes", "I will tell you, we're looking at this on a long term basis. I think the restructure opportunities across most of the businesses and I think as you'll see here in the coming months, we'll take additional actions based on what we see happening in the markets because here we want to outperform this year and outperform next year and even beyond. So we're going to right size the business for the markets as they exist today and we want to be proactive as opposed to reactive with this restructuring. I think that the $150 million is meant today a sense of urgency on our part to get on with it. More to come beyond that.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowan and Company", "Could you give us some help in terms of what types of restructuring are you looking at doing here? What sectors? If you could help us there. What types of things are you looking at doing?", "Gregory Hayes", "Clearly the $150 million that we're launching here is all quick pay back. It's primarily head count related restructuring. It's taking out structure. It's taking G&A, taking out overhead across the businesses. In fact all of this $150 million as we look at it has a pay back of less than a year. Even if we didn't see all the gains in the back half, I'm still confident that we can cover this just through the restructuring phase.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Maybe just switch from the P&L to the balance sheet for starters. I assume its pension, but your equity took roughly a $5 billion hit sequentially in the quarter. Could you give us some color on what's going on there and where the funded status actually played out at the end of the year?", "Gregory Hayes", "It's almost a $6 billion charge of other comprehensive income out of the equity section. $4 billion of that related to pension plan performance. We ended the year down about 27% on a return basis and on a recent basis, I think we're 91% funded at the end of the year, so just a little bit under the target of 94% funding this year.", "The other major change in the equity section is the charge related to these currencies, translation adjustment. As the currencies move, obviously against us in the back half, that was a big swing of the equity section as well.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "On the flip side of that equation the big move and other long term liabilities is pension moving around also?", "Gregory Hayes", "That's exactly right.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Switching gears back to a restructuring question, as you look deeper and go for more in the slowdown, do you get more into heavy manufacturing restructuring actions, tougher to do, longer to play out, slower payback. Maybe just some line of sight on how this might progress over the next year or two.", "Gregory Hayes", "I think the first project of restructuring we're going to launch as I said is going to be very quick payback and as we dig further and further into this restructuring, obviously the payback is not quite as good. Eventually you do have to start taking out capacity. Right now everything that we're looking at has pretty good payback.", "These G&A actions are less than a year. Some of the branch office restructurings around the world, the payback is a year, two years. And then we get into the big factory closures if we come to that, when we're moving volumes, we're going to be pressed for a long time. Those are more like four year payback so you're right on track. It's dependent on how we see the markets develop here. We'll tell you how deep we'll have to cut.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "On this question of deferrals a couple of people poked around it. I'm just wondering if there's anything different in the complexion of what's going on. In other words, are you seeing deferrals once projects have already started and people kind of killing stuff mid stream or are these deferrals that are happening kind of earlier before ground breaking and how does that compare with what you've seen in the past?", "Akhil Johri", "I think a lot of the deferrals are in China, the emerging markets there. There is not much when a project starts or before ground breaks. Some of these deferrals are before these projects have even the ground is broken. They do have some deferrals with us and the reality is the underlying demand will not go away because there is going to be the demand for people to move to cities in China and maybe a gap for a year or six months, but then the transition trend will start again and some of these projects will be back on track. A lot of deferrals are in the emerging markets are more distant than what we're seeing in the Western Europe and Asian market.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "What's the color for the tax rate in '09?", "Gregory Hayes", "It will be just about 28% is the targeted tax rate as it was for the last few year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Douglas Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Douglas Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "On Carrier, if I look at Q4 you would have had benefits from copper. It should have helped the margin and I would expect the average currency that you dealt with was not as weak as you thought it was going to be at the time of the December dinner. Could you talk about the margins in each of the four units there? I know you said commercial was up. What happened in each of these that got you to this lower margin in Q4?", "Gregory Hayes", "Just a couple of point here. If you think about copper, copper actually averaged about $3.37 for us for the fourth quarter at Carrier. As we said, we've got about six months of long term agreements in place. Typically the significant decline in copper down to $1.50 a pound we saw towards the end of the year really didn't benefit and won't benefit Carrier until sometime in the second quarter or the second half of 2009.", "As far as currency, I think one of the biggest surprises was the challenges that Carrier faced was this unprecedented move in currencies. I'm not talking about U.S. dollar versus Euro. I'm talking about Japanese Yen versus Argentinean Peso or Brazilian Real, and we actually about have of the margin decline that we saw in the residential international business was actually related to these abnormal or displacements between these currencies. ", "We're producing product in Japan or Thailand and shipping them to South America and other places, and typically we would hedge those transactions, but then again we've never seen currency shifts the way we saw in the fourth quarter. That was really the biggest headwind that Carrier saw in the quarter.", "Douglas Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "But when you look at the margin, you're saying that operating leverage was not a particularly important issue here? What I'm wondering is as you go into '09, and I know you're expecting weaker revenues, are we looking at an issue here with capacity and operating leverage that will put some additional stress on margin?", "Akhil Johri", "I think if you go back to the map that we already laid out in December, we expect high single digit declines, maybe a little bit worse than what we have seen in the fourth quarter. That would give about $375 million headwind of contribution point of view. We have an additional $150 million of headwind from FX, so that's a $525 million upheaval headwind.", "Of that, that means on the other side the commodity which has started to give some benefits, maybe more in the later half as we get the benefits of long term agreements going away and these new rates starting to come into play, that's actually $100 million to $125 million. Carrier has some aggressive cost reduction actions that they have taken this year which will be another $100 million to $125 million and the restructuring actions should give another $150 million.", "That is the largest chunk of the restructuring dollars in this year so that will all go back to the $100 million roughly guidance that we gave out year over year. Is there more to spend? As we see the order rates and certainly in the first quarter and first half as we look at the more profitable Carrier business order rate, the guidance, yes. The income we expect in as Greg mentioned earlier, that's basically the manpower from [inaudible].", "[Douglas Harnett \u2013 Sanford Burnstein]", "So is it fair to say that there will be pressure basically of an operating leverage nature that you're going to be able to offset that pressure with restructuring, commodity prices and product cost reduction.

But there is not a huge amount of metric pricing.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "About the aerospace, I think in the December meeting you were talking about a slightly lower aftermarket in total lower in aerospace. Obviously with taking down your traffic forecast from flat to now down 3% to 4%, I would imagine it would be materially worse than that.", "Gregory Hayes", "Obviously if RPM's do in fact come in down to 3% to 4% that's going to put pressure on the aftermarket both in Pratt Whitney as well as at Hamilton.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Any sort of guidance on what the aftermarket would look like under that scenario for you?", "Gregory Hayes", "I'm not comfortable giving an updated guidance to that. I think we closed out Q4 okay and the first couple of weeks have been okay, but I think it's too early to really give you any specific guidance. Again at Belmar, we'll have a change to update you on all this. We'll have a little bit more results under our belt here.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "I think for Carrier you talked about a 10% organic revenue decline in '09.

I'm assuming that's from Carrier. Did that have any outside impact on the margin?", "Gregory Hayes", "If you think about it, inventories were down about $700 million from September through December. Carrier was the biggest piece of that, down about $300 million, but we actually saw inventory reductions at each of the businesses for the first time in a long time. Pratt was the other one, down almost $250 million.", "I think it's just good inventory management that we've been focused on for the last year or so as you know, and it's just a typical, normal fourth quarter behavior.", "Nigel Coe \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Do you have any targets for inventories maybe at 2009 year end target inventories?", "Gregory Hayes", "Let me just tell you that a 50 basis point improvement in inventory turns each year, so if you think about that, I think our inventory turns at the end of the year around 4.8.

Are they giving you any color on the end markets?", "Akhil Johri", "Nothing exceptional other than what you are hearing or reading every day.

What about shipments?", "Akhil Johri", "There is a little bit of a lag between order and deliveries. Shipments were down in [inaudible] in the fourth quarter and there was a decline towards the end of the year in December so we expect to have some greater impact in first quarter profit.

I think we should wait for when you have the data in front of you in February. We can have six weeks at that time and that would be the time to really talk about it.

We're talking a couple of month's maybe.", "Gregory Hayes", "That's exactly what happened. I think in the fourth quarter, we saw these deferrals accelerate especially in China. They were not cancelled; they were just simply deferred into 2009.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "But if the market conditions for your customers in China remain weak for the next six months, is it conceivable that Otis OEM production could actually turn out to be lower than your forecasting because of these deferrals?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes it could be.

But as we see the visibility the strong cash flows and the fourth quarter is a great example.", "Despite everything going on in the world, we generated 141% net income of free cash flow so unless we see some major change in the markets, I would think that UTX shares are going to be the place that we continue to invest.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "I understand the acquisition agenda, and could you provide a little color in terms of are you close to finding suppliers or horizontal transactions that would add to the business in a material way? Are discussions more lively than they've been or are people still holding out for the same argument that you just made with your stock?", "Gregory Hayes", "Obviously I think everybody's got the same view in terms of the valuations today. I think Louis said about a willing buyer, willing seller. We are clearly in the market. We think there's some great values out there. We want to add to the core. We still have strong cash flows. I think we have a good currency that we could do a year this year.", "But again, willing buyer, a willing seller. These things take time. I can't comment on anything more specifically than that as you know, but we'll keep looking.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "You've talked a number of times; a lot of the tone of the call has been the challenge of predictability. Are there any signs you have that, you talked about positive or negative, what you're looking for that would give you some comfort that in fact that whenever you reset guidance that this is rock solid bottom. We've seen the worst and sort of just to complete the thought is that if the number turns out to be below the low end, are you prepared to say, \"Look this is a number that's rock solid and it was just hard to get there?\"", "Gregory Hayes", "I think you're a couple of steps ahead of us here. We're not going to change the guidance. I think the part of the slide we talked about; we still see that as guidance for the year.

That is, overhead costs and efficiency within the supply chain and the factories and we're going to continue to focus on those things and we're going to work to outperform. It's a tough question. I think it's something that we'll continue to focus on.", "We don't know how bad the markets are. I think we're actually cautiously optimistic. There's lots of stimulus out there. We have the biggest stimulus package passed here shortly I think here by the U.S. Congress that's going to be signed into law by the new President and once consumer confidence starts to recover as well all know, that's what drives the U.S. economy and eventually the world economy.", "So I don't want to throw out any guidance or anything else, so you know, stand by what we said in December and we'll see what happens.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I wanted to get a sense of a better understanding of your economic assumptions embedded in 2009 guidance and a sense of a change of revenue visibility you're seeing kind of versus usual. If you think of the profile of the visibility and kind of year one and year two for sales, how does that differ for you as you think ahead of not only 2009 but 2010. Because I'm just wondering on 2010 given your combination of long cycle and shorter cycle businesses, some of 2009 sales would be somewhat cushioned but I'm wondering how much cushion you have in 2010 sales.", "Gregory Hayes", "My crystal ball is not very clear beyond about tomorrow and as we get out to 2010 it's really pretty cloudy. I will tell you that the backlogs are still very strong in all of the businesses. If you think about Otis as I said before backlogs were up 9% for the year and the shorter cycle businesses obviously backlogs I don't think is really as much difference as just these general economic conditions that we're experiencing in the world.", "We've got very strong backlog in Sikorsky. I think we've got good backlog in the Fire business, Fire & Security. The OEM's businesses at Hamilton and Pratt all look pretty good. But there's obviously pressure on all things. I was asked that of the military spending. Aftermarket will continue to be strong. People still use elevators every day even if they're not building new buildings.", "40% of our revenues come from the aftermarket so I'm not trying not to generalize here, but we feel pretty good about the revenues for this year and not so bad about the revenue outlook for next year.", "Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On you assumption for the first half being weak in 2009 and the second half recovery, is that embedded in that? Are you predicating a global recovery in the second half so that your earnings kind of rise along with that rise in consumer confidence that you talked about?", "", "Gregory Hayes", "I think what we're anticipating is there will probably be a late 2009 recovery. We'll probably be led by consumer confidence and I think mostly that will happen in the U.S. And we will see that first at Carrier. Carrier is the first to see the pain of an economic slowdown and first to see the benefit of an economic expansion.", "As well, think about comparison from 2008 to 2009, the back half will be easier because it was a pretty tough back half of 2008. We'll see what happens. Right now, I think we're cautiously optimistic as I said that you should see an economic rebound with these masses in those packages.", "Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Turning to Hamilton Sundstrand, are the Sundstrand systems that you've delivered on the 787, are they presently able to fully interface with all the other systems on the aircraft or are you having troubles there. Can you talk to us a little bit about that?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think in fact all the systems that we have delivered including electric power systems are up and operating and we are fully ready to go for first flight here. I think we're still working with the Boeing company, has a final certification of the electric power system. That's done by the end of the month, but right now I think everything is good to go.", "Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And that includes being able to operate within the other system, not just on a stand alone basis?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Myles Walton \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "You mentioned a couple of times this stimulus package. I'm just wondering is there any direct benefit that you could see or could capitalize from it or more talking about the indirect in consumer confidence issue you alluded to.", "Gregory Hayes", "Obviously the consumer confidence piece is the easiest to point to but I think some of the proposals that we've seen in the stimulus package especially as they relate to energy efficiency products fit right into the Carrier, Fire & Security and Otis businesses, so we are actually optimistic that we will get a little bit of a bump just from those particular programs.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Any way to quantify that?", "Gregory Hayes", "I wish I could. I think it's just a general feeling. You are going to see investments in energy efficiency and continue to see investments in green buildings. That is part of the new Presidents agenda. I think that's all generally good for UTC.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Could you give an update on the F35 engine development and your schedule for delivering the redesigned third stage engine to Lockheed?", "Gregory Hayes", "We are still on schedule. We've had a couple of testing issues over the last month. We had some foreign object enter one of the engines. We had another engine shutdown. But other than the kind of typical, normal development problems that you would have on a high tech engine like this, I think we're pretty much on track.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "So that could happen in the next few weeks to the next month or so?", "Gregory Hayes", "I don't have an exact date. Let me get back to you on that. Right now, word from Pratt is we're on schedule.", "Thank you everyone. We appreciate your time. It has certainly been a very good 2008 and we should not forget the 2008 performance. 2009, it will be challenging. We all realize that but we are prepared and we look forward to speaking to you in another couple of weeks.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Akhil Johri, Vice President of Financial Planning and Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s homepage at www.utc.com. ", "The company reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide detail on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. ", "Please go ahead Mr. Hayes. ", "Gregory Hayes", "Thank you and good morning everyone. As you\u2019ve seen from our press release this morning, a tough quarter on the top line, with exceptional execution across the business; no surprises here, just the type of execution you come to expect from the UTC team. Our focus on cost continues to pay off; segment operating margin reached a record high of 14.9%, that\u2019s adjusted for restructuring and a one time gain, with aggressive restructuring and cost reduction actions leading to 50 basis points of margin expansion. ", "We also saw excellent progress in driving down working capital this quarter. As a result free cash flow was 140% of net income, even with $400 million of contributions to our domestic pension plans. As far as the order rates, no significant changes in the year-over-year order rates in the quarter; however, order rates do appear to be stabilizing.", "Strong execution and relentless cost reduction give us confidence, even in the face of difficult markets, that we will resume earnings growth next year while delivering on our commitments this year. The evidence of the cost reduction is in the segment operating margins, all were double-digit and 406 Otis, Fire & Security, Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney saw operating margin gains of 100 basis points or more, again adjusted for restructuring a one-time gain.", "Otis led the way at 21.9%, that\u2019s 210 basis points higher than the prior year. Carrier delivered double-digit margins this quarter as a result of a relentless focus on cost takeout, despite very difficult end markets. This margin performance was achieved even while UTC\u2019s revenues decreased $2.7 billion or 17% to $13.2 billion.", "Revenues decreased 11% organically and 5% from foreign currency translation. Net divestiture accounted for the remaining one point of the revenue decline. Again, no surprises as we knew the competitors would be the toughest this quarter, against a very strong second quarter last year.", "Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.05, that\u2019s 20% lower than last year and inline with the first half expectations we\u2019ve been communicating throughout the quarter. Current quarter results include $0.22 of restructuring costs and a $0.06 non-taxable gain related to acquiring a controlling interest in an Otis joint venture.", "Last year\u2019s second quarter you recall had a $0.06 charge for restructuring costs. Absent the impact of these restructuring costs in both quarter and the one time gain this year, earnings per share was down 12%. Approximately two-thirds of this decline or about $0.11 was from foreign currency translation, combined with a negative impact of Pratt & Whitney currency hedging program.", "On the revenues, only Sikorsky saw a growth. Revenues of the other five businesses were down, with particular weakness in our short cycle segments. Carrier revenues declined 29% in the quarter, 21% organically. While we would all like to say that the economy is improving, we\u2019ve really seen simply stabilization in order rates across the businesses. ", "Consumer confidence does show some indication of improvement, but the US Housing starts outlook is more or less the same as we saw in March and the outlook for commercial construction and aerospace traffic are somewhat worse.", "China, on the other hand, has started to show the positive impact of the government stimulus program. As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve always expected China to recover first and we did see early signs of that in this quarter. New equipment orders in China, at Otis and Carrier Commercial HVAC were down about 18% year-over-year in the second quarter on a constant currency basis, compared with a decline of almost 40% in the first quarter.", "Turning to slide three, as a result of the continued weakness in order rates, we\u2019re revising our full year revenue guidance from $55 billion to $53 billion. That\u2019s down 11% from last year, rather. We still expect to spend about $750 million on restructuring this year and we now estimate one-time gains to be only around $200 million. So restructuring in excess of gains looks to be around $550 million at the high end of our prior range of $400 to $550 million.", "With the lower revenue outlook and a higher net restructuring, we\u2019re tightening our EPS guidance range with the top end at $4.20, compared with $4.50 previously. Better than expected traction on cost reduction actions, higher savings from restructuring, and a weaker US dollar give us confidence in the bottom end of the range of $4, despite those significantly lower revenues. We\u2019re now assuming the euro at 1.38 for the rest of 2009 versus our assumption of 1.27 going into the year.", "On restructuring, we spent about $300 million this quarter, that\u2019s $464 million year-to-date, will addressed volume declines and to eliminate structural and overhead costs across all of the businesses. All 2009 programs are now expected to yield a run rate savings of $700 million; $300 million in 2009, an incremental $300 million next year and then another $100 million in 2011. All this will make the company more cost competitive when the economy does recovery.", "In addition to restructuring savings, we\u2019re also seeing the benefits of other cost reduction actions, in areas such as travel, furloughs, E&D employee attrition. As an example, our overall headcount has now gone down by more than 12,000 since December, and that excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. About 70% of that 12,000 decrease results from the 2008 and 2009 restructuring programs.", "As I noted before, free cash flow in the quarter was 140% of net income attributable to common share owners at $1.4 billion that included $400 million of domestic pension contributions. The solid cash flow resulted from strong working capital performance across the business, particularly in collections. ", "While we\u2019ve made some progress reducing inventory there\u2019s still a lot of work to do there, particularly at the aerospace businesses. Year-to-date, free cash flow is now at 99% of net income and for the full year we continue to expect free cash flow to be equal or excess of net income.", "I\u2019ll come back and talk more about the outlook for the rest of 2009 in just a minute, but let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit detail.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks Greg. Turning to page four, let me remind you that I\u2019ll talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and non-recurring items as we usually do. Otis delivered another strong quarter as Greg said, with margin expansion of 210 basis points with 21.9%, despite the downturn in global construction. Operating profits in the quarter were down 6% on a 15% decline in revenue.", "At constant currency, operating profits grew 5% on 6% lower revenues as aggressive cost reductions and continued strength in the contractual maintenance business has mitigate the impact of lower new equipment volume. Since the beginning of the year, Otis has reduced headcount by over 2,600 employees or 4% of its workforce.", "New equipment revenue was down 9% excluding currency, with mid-teen declines in Europe and North America. Revenues in Asia were flattish with China up mid-single-digit. At constant currency, new equipment orders were down 38% from last year\u2019s record level, which included a large order for the World Trade Center.", "Year-over-year, orders in China were down high teens, compared with down around 40% in Q1. Given that first half order rates, Otis now expects full year revenues to be down near double digits compared with 2008. However, in light of Otis strong operating margin performance, good traction on cost reduction actions, continued strength in the maintenance business, and improved foreign currency translation, we now expect profit for the year to decline by $50 million, $100 million improvement from the midpoint of our previous guidance range.", "On slide five turning to Carrier, operating margin exceeded 10% in the quarter, down 210 basis points on 29% lower revenues. Carrier continues on the path of aggressive transformation, to a simpler, more focused, higher returns business. Cost reduction and restructuring actions contributed more than 250 basis points of margin in the quarter and helped mitigate the impact of this steep volume decline.", "Since June of 2008, Carrier\u2019s headcount has been reduced by 5200 or 13% of the workforce, before the impact of net divestitures. Carrier\u2019s organic revenue declined 21% in the quarter. As in Q1, Carrier\u2019s most significant volume decline occurred in the higher margin transport refrigeration business, with sales down about 40% at constant currency, driven by container and Europe truck trailer.", "The commercial HVAC business was down mid teens organically and we saw new equipment orders there decline about 20%, again at constant currency. U.S. residential was down 16%, about inline with the market. Carrier\u2019s prior guidance assumed an improvement in business conditions in the second half of 2009. ", "In light of continued weakness in order rates, Carrier now expects organic revenues in the third quarter to be down inline with first half and expects profit growth to resume in the fourth quarter on the back of easier compares and continued cost reductions. For the full year Carrier expects revenues down in the mid 20s and earnings down in the range of $500 million to $550 million, with second half earnings down approximately $100 million to $150 million versus prior guidance of flat second half earnings.", "On slide six, UTC Fire & Security delivered a solid quarter with operating margin expansion up 180 basis points to 10.6% on 23% lower revenues. Organically, revenues contracted 8%, with both fire safety and electronic security revenues down high single digits in the quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced revenue 12% and net M&A activity accounted for three points of the year-over-year revenue decline.", "Operating profit decreased 8%, excluding FX profits grew 9%, reflecting the benefits of integration of field operations, restructuring and continuing productivity and cost control initiatives. We remain confident in UTC Fire & Security\u2019s 2009 guidance of flat profits on revenues down mid teens.", "Turning to the aerospace businesses on slide seven, revenues at Pratt & Whitney declined 15% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower overall after market volume and Pratt Canada engine shipments. Revenues were also adversely impacted by net hedging activities at Pratt Canada.", "Large commercial engine spare revenues were down in the mid 20s and book-to-bill was slightly below one. Engine shipments at Pratt Canada were down about 25%. Operating profit declined 7% in the quarter. The impact from lower revenues adverse mix and unfavorable foreign currency impact at Pratt Canada was partially offset by benefits from restructuring, productivity improvements and fewer large commercial engine shipments. E&D was also favorable in the quarter. Operating margin at 16.8% was up 100 basis points.", "Turning to the full year, we now expect large commercial spares revenues to be down around 20%. At Pratt Canada, we expect engine shipments to be down in the high teens. Our prior expectation for both was down double digits. Pratt\u2019s large engine MRO activities are also lower than expected as airlines conserve cash in phase of lower traffic and yields. ", "Overall, Pratt & Whitney 2009 revenues will likely be down mid-to-high single-digits. Operating profit is now expected to be down $100 million year-over-year, as compared with the prior guidance of down $0 million to $50 million. Pratt continues to aggressively reduce operating costs and rationalize capacity in manufacturing operations and maintenance repair and overhaul networks.", "On slide eight in the quarter, Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were down 15%. Organic revenues were down 9%, with aerospace after market down double-digits, the industrial business down 25% and Aero OEM flat. Operating profit declined 20% primarily from lower volume in higher margin businesses. Commercial spares revenues were down over 20% again. ", "Lower E&D discretionary cost curtailment across the business, favorable mix in Aero OEM and productivity improvements in the repair shops, partially offset the volume impact. Orders for the industrial business continue to reflect the impact of the global economic slow down and were down about 35% in the quarter, including three points from foreign exchange.", "Commercial spares book-to-bill was above one, including a few large long lead time orders. Depressed order rates in high margin businesses continue to put pressure Hamilton Sundstrand\u2019s 2009 outlook. We now expect commercial after market to be down low teens for the year and the industrial business to be down in the mid 20s.", "In total, we now expect Hamilton revenues to be down mid-to-high single-digits, operating profit to be down $75 million to $100 million as compared to the prior guidance of flat. Hamilton continues to reduce operation costs through workforce resizing, furloughs, merit deferrals and other actions in response to the challenging market conditions.", "Turning to Sikorsky on slide nine, operating profit grew 26% on 6% higher revenues. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 50 large helicopters, 40 based on military platforms and end commercial. Sikorsky continues to target delivery of between 230 to 240 large aircrafts in 2009. Operating margin expanded 160 basis points in the quarter to 10.1%. This improvement was primarily due to better aircraft mix and lower manufacturing costs.", "Sikorsky continues to expand its footprint of international suppliers. During the second quarter it completed an agreement to manufacture S-92 helicopter cabins with the Tata Group in India. Sikorsky is also making progress with the international Black Hawk in its facility in Mielec, Poland. ", "While we see continued weakness in the commercial market, we expect Sikorsky to continue its strong performance for the remainder of the year, with revenues still projected to grow in the high teens and operating profit expected to increase approximately $125 million.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for a wrap-up.", "Greg Hayes", "", "Okay. Looking at slide 10 now on the webcast, a very strong quarter in terms of execution and very strong cash performance and very, very strong cost traction in the phase of difficult end markets. Continued focus on what we can control resulted in over $350 million of discreet cost reductions, including the restructuring savings in the quarter and this limited the impact of the $2.7 billion revenue decline.", "Just a reminder, the $350 million of savings follows $200 million for cost reductions in the first quarter, so even more traction from aggressive cost actions in the second quarter than what we saw in the first.", "Wrapping up, our full year 2009 revenue expectation is now $53 billion, that\u2019s down 11% from last year and this $2 billion decrease from our prior guidance reflects the expectation, an incremental $2.5 billion decline in organic revenue, and about $500 million from recently announced divestitures, partially offset by the weaker US dollar.", "The negative margin related to this volume decline is expected to be partially offset by incremental benefits of the cost reduction and restructuring actions, as well as more favorable net commodities and a weaker US dollar also helps. Our full year 2009 EPS guidance as I said before is a range of $4 to $4.20, down 14% to 18% from 2008, excluding the impact of acquisition related costs.", "Excluding restructuring expense and one-time gains, we see earnings per share down to 7% to 11% compared to 2008, and a revenue decline of 11%. A big slice of that revenue reduction is coming in our high margin aerospace spares and our transport refrigeration businesses, making the lower EPS drop-through even more impressive.", "As for other guidance for 2009, our expectation for free cash flow for the year remains unchanged and equal to or in excess of net income come. Capital expenditures in the quarter were down 43% or 37% year-to-date and as a result we now expect the capital expenditures to be down about 30% for the full year.", "Our 2009 M&A placeholder remains at $2 billion, although our acquisition spend year-to-date is only $153 million net of divestitures. As always, deals happen when they happen and we\u2019ll continue to be aggressive in identifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities. We also remain disciplined in our approach. On share repurchase, our share repurchases guidance remains at $1 billion. Second quarter share repurchase was $150 million year-to-date, $350 million.", "Okay slide 11 now, a couple of thoughts on 2010. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions about whether we expect earnings to grow next year. Well, there are many moving pieces at this point. I would simply remind you that the strength of UTC is in its market leading franchises, with geographic customer and product diversity, along with strong after-market businesses. This portfolio of businesses and the aggressive cost reduction action we\u2019re taking this year, will position the company to resume earnings growth next year.", "To be clear, we do not anticipate a significant economic recovery in 2010 and as we begin building our detailed 2010 financial plan, the business units are developing cost-led plans without much reliance on top-line recovery. We will see some tailwind next year from restructuring actions taken this year, another $300 million. ", "While there maybe some weakness in our long cycle businesses next year, such as commercial Aero OEM and Otis new equipment in commercial HVAC, our short cycle businesses such as the commercial aero after-market, residential track and transfer refrigeration should be among the first to recover when the economy does improve.", "Our continued focus on process improvement is driving cost reductions we\u2019ve seen across the businesses. Currently 54% of our businesses are operating at the gold and silver level, well on our way to meet the goal that Louie laid out of 70% by the end of this year. Also, our ACE initiative with suppliers is gaining traction with 44% of key suppliers spend now with gold or performing suppliers; well on track to Louie\u2019s target of 70% by 2011.", "With our relentless focus on cost, season management team, significant after-market content and continued investment in innovative new products, we believe we\u2019re well-positioned to outperform again in 2010.", "With that Erin, let me stop here and open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "You\u2019ve got Carrier in the question mark column, yet. You called out growth in 4Q EBIT, which implies that you\u2019re pretty confident in the first half growth at least in 2010. So I\u2019m just wondering why that would be in that column rather than the plus.", "Greg Hayes", "I think Carrier, there\u2019s a lot of pieces to Carrier. I think the long cycle part of Carrier, which is the HVAC and commercial HVAC pieces is a bit of question mark for next year. We actually would expect that to be down slightly. I think the real question on Carrier though goes to the nature of the economic recovery and when we\u2019re going to see a rebound in housing and when we\u2019re going to see a rebound in demand for the transport refrigeration products.", "Again those are very economically sensitive businesses. They have been hurt the quickest and most I would say. So until we see some real signs of an economic recovery, I think Carrier remains in that kind of question mark column for next year.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "On the revenues of [Inaudible], that\u2019s too much of a surprise, but at this point do you think revenues are becoming a bit more predictable for fiscal \u201809? I mean is the rate of change in your projections from month-to-month starting to moderate?", "Greg Hayes", "It has Nigel. In fact if you think about it, the order rates have stabilized as we said. Really since March we\u2019ve seen the order rates fairly stable, albeit at these low rates. So as we look at the back half here and we are sitting here in July, we\u2019re fairly confident in this $53 billion. ", "Could it be a little better or a little worse, yes depending upon FX, but I think for the most part we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility and I would say realistic revenue guidance here based upon what we see today in the markets.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Then one more for me, a quick one; what\u2019s the buffer right now protecting the low end range? What\u2019s the buffer you\u2019re continuing to see at the bottom in the range right now?", "Greg Hayes", "At the $4 level we have about $150 million of contingency left. You\u2019ll recall back in March, at that time we talked about a $350 million contingency, that\u2019s obviously been eaten up a little bit by the revenue reduction, as well as the lower gains on restructuring, but we\u2019re offset by some good news on cost traction as well as FX. $150 million, it feels it\u2019s like about like the right number as we sit here in July again, with half of the year behind us.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "If that $150 million\u2019s still there at the beginning of December, do you then use that for additional restructuring?", "Greg Hayes", "That is a great question for Louie to ask, the answer in December, but I would say probably as we sit here today, if the business remains strong and cost traction improves, I would say there is probably more restructuring in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Greg, on the restructuring, you\u2019re well above half of your 750 so far. How do you think this plays out next couple quarters? I mean how much more than 750 could you come in at, if the dollar weakens or something else happens in your favor?", "Greg Hayes", "We were a little bit above this quarter. I think we talked about 250; we actually launched a little over 300 million, so I think 467 year-to-date. We feel good about the restructuring list that we\u2019ve got. It is a robust list. It is well north of the $750 million that we have targeted. I think the issue that we\u2019ve got as it looks towards the back half of the year is execution.", "In all of the businesses you\u2019ll see with the exception of Sikorsky, have taken on significant restructuring activities. So there\u2019s a lot of things going on out there. There is pressure to probably spend more. I think we\u2019ll even see a little bit of restructuring follow into 2010 and we\u2019ll have to play it by year, but the number will only go up from where it is today, and certainly you can expect to see some additional next year.", "Akhil Johri", "Joe, with regard to your calendarization question, I think we\u2019re right now putting about $200 million for third quarter and the balance in Q4 to go up to the $750 million.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. In China, that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing the best results in the company and of course that is where the GDP looks by far the best. How sustainable though do your people there, particularly in Otis think that this recovery is?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, what we\u2019ve seen in the last quarter Joe is really a recovery at the low end of the market. In terms of order rates, our XOEC business orders I think are actually up about 15% or so, and that low end is where the government stimulus program is helping the most; this is on the residential construction market.", "I would tell you, I think that looks to be sustainable. The 7.9% or 8% GDP growth is all very good. We\u2019ve also seen foreign direct investment start to come back to last year\u2019s level. Still down year-over-year, but again, as foreign direct investment picks up and I think the compounding effect of the stimulus picks up, we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence we\u2019re going to see a good back half for Otis in China, as well as Carrier and even a strong 2010.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Then just two more quick number questions; what\u2019s your commercial HVAC backlog down year-to-date, first of all? Secondly, could you just discuss your Hamilton E&D spending and where you\u2019re running versus where you thought it would be? ", "Akhil Johri", "Hamilton E&D was a little bit of a reduction in the second quarter Joe, on a year-over-year basis. Overall as you know we had E&D down about $50 million this quarter and Hamilton was roughly 40% of that in terms of year-over-year decline. We do expect a continued decline in the second half there, primarily as the 787 spend comes down. Although, you can imagine with the delay in the first flight, there is some pressure on that.", "With regard to commercial HVAC, I think the orders have been worse than these revenues that we have generated, so backlog is down. The orders have been down roughly 20% plus for the first half, while the revenues have been down organically in the low teens. So you can do the math, it\u2019s down slightly, not huge.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Strauss \u2013 UBS.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS ", "Greg, could you maybe touch on the outlook for Otis new equipment shipments as you think about 2010? I think you had previously guided; originally we started thinking about flat and I think you talked about down 5 to 10. Just given the order rates you\u2019re seeing now, how do you think about Otis new equipment in 2010?", "Greg Hayes", "I think for this year, we expect Otis new equipment to be down kind of in that 10% \u2018ish range, it\u2019s down 9% in the quarter and certainly with orders down around 40% on the new equipment side, that 9% or 10% down will play out next year. So I think again, another 5% down next year is probably in the realm of reasonableness. I think part of the question here is how quickly China recovers.", "We have to remember, China accounts for a third of the new equipment business at Otis. So even though we\u2019ve got these big order rates coming down, China is recovering, as well as there were a lot of deferrals at the end of this year that will probably play out next year. ", "So as we\u2019re thinking about it, I think there is obviously pressure on new equipment next year, but again I would say 5%, but it\u2019s a little early and we\u2019ll come back to you obviously at the end of the year with some better visibility there.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS ", "Then on the revenue side overall for this year, I mean order rates are relatively stable sequentially, yet you\u2019re looking at I guess in the second half of the year that revenues are going to actually increase I think 10% or so sequentially second half versus the first half of the year in total. What specifically other than a little bit of a benefit on the FX side, what else is going to be driving that? I guess what kind of gets better on the revenue side in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year?", "Akhil Johri", "FX clearly is a big driver as you pointed out, David. The other factor is that sequentially we do have some improvement in the second half, particularly in our commercial construction related industries every year, because more projects get completed in Q4 as people are running to complete their budgets if you will. So there is some seasonality which we see every year in our business in the second half versus the first half sequentially. ", "On a year-over-year basis I would point out that the benefit from easier competitors, if you recall Pratt spares were down mid teens in the third quarter; similarly carrier organic revenue was down 7% in fourth quarter. So we\u2019re coming off some easier compares, better FX and just the normal seasonality of the business season.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS ", "Okay, and the last one Greg, what was the net pricing benefit if you had one on the quarter, how much was it in total?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, there was a small net pricing benefit; it was about $40 million for the quarter across the business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague - Citigroup.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "I\u2019d like to get into the restructuring a little bit more; Greg you mentioned kind of furloughing and other actions kind of driving the 350 in Q2 versus the 200 in Q1. I just wondering if you can kind of separate what\u2019s going on in terms of kind of structural cost reductions, relative to things that will eventually kind of swing back the other way when we do get a volume turn.", "Greg Hayes", "If you think about it, the $350 million of savings we talked about in the quarter, about a little less than $150 million of that came from actual restructuring, which I would consider to be structural type of cost takeout. We\u2019ve also of course had a lot of just cost control, cost containment. ", "We have seen for instance, travel is down more than $150 million in the quarter. We have seen the benefits of furlough across all of our businesses, and furlough is simply people taking days off without pay. I think everyone of our businesses have done that. We\u2019re also seeing the benefit of net attrition. Net attrition is more than 3,000 people year-to-date rather and we\u2019re just not back filling those jobs. We\u2019ve also deferred merit increases out of the year. ", "So, if you think about it, some of that will obviously come back. I would say, two-thirds of the savings rather is structural and one-third is probably timing that will come back. You also have to point out; I think the employees have been remarkably good about all of the cost takeout.", "There has been a lot of sacrifice across all of the businesses from the furloughs, flying coach to Singapore is no fun thing to do, but all of that is part of what we\u2019ve been doing here to contain costs. So again, its good traction; of that 350 we\u2019ll get a little bit of that back, because we will have merit increases and we won\u2019t have furloughs forever, but I would say, roughly two-thirds probably structurally out of the business.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Then if I think about this 700 that you rolled up, 300 this year, 300 next and 100 left in \u201811, those are all structural cost takeouts.", "Greg Hayes", "That\u2019s correct. Those are run rate savings that will repeat year-over-year.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Kind of changing gears a little bit, I wonder if you could just give us a little more granularity on Carrier as it relates to kind of the price and cost dynamics in that business.", "Akhil Johri", "Jeff, we still saw some pricing benefits in Carrier this year. You recall that in third quarter last year, U.S. residential Carrier raised prices by up to 6% for its various products and we have continued to do see some benefits off that. The Carrier team would tell you though that there is increasing pressure and you would see probably, particularly on U.S. residential side and on the Commercial HVAC side, increasing price pressure in the back half. However, on the opposite side we would see increasing benefits on the commodities.", "As you know, they have a rolling blocking practice with the copper consumption that they have, so these back half benefits on the commodities side will be greater than they\u2019ve seen in the first half. So net-net, I think first and second half are balanced; their dynamics are just different; pricing more in first half, less in second, gross commodities more in first and less in second.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Finally Greg, when do you pull the lever a little harder on the share repurchase if the deals don\u2019t start to materialize?", "Greg Hayes", "I guess that\u2019s clearly a second half action for us. You can see, we\u2019re really pretty light to the $1 billion guidance here. Quite frankly, we\u2019ve been conserving cash in the first half of the year as cash was very, very light as you remember back in the first quarter. So I would expect you would see share repurchase run rate ramp up here in the third and the fourth quarter.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Just actually one more quick one if I could. Given the growing importance of Chinese new equipment as it relates to Otis, any update on kind of service attachment rates there? Are you making any better progress on the market side?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, service has been growing at a slightly faster rate than new equipment, but this is a long term opportunity for us. It\u2019s not something which will happen in a quarter or in a year even, but we think the installed base that we are creating in China will help Otis over the long time over many, many years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets.", "Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets", "Greg, if we compare your commentary back in March about M&A, there was an expectation that UTC might be a bit more aggressive going after deals. Since then the tone has gone back to a little bit more of the placeholder comments staying disciplined. Give us a sense of what the pipeline looks like, were there deals closer that you thought you might get in the beginning of the year and how do you expect that to play out?", "Greg Hayes", "I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re been any less disciplined or more disciplined. I think it\u2019s just typical UTC acquisition reviews and we were hopeful I think earlier, where back in March when we saw equity prices solo, that there would be opportunities for us to do some deals that quite frankly would be very accretive to the business, but it\u2019s taking time and quite frankly, it may take some more time.", "I think people\u2019s expectations of price have not really come down to what the level of their stock price is and so we\u2019re just going to wait this out I think, again. We don\u2019t expect the economy to recover any time soon. We expect as these 52-week highs go into the rear-view mirror, people will become more receptive I would say, to some of the discussions. It is a very full pipeline. ", "I think we\u2019ve got a lot of good targets out there, but it just takes time. So I wouldn\u2019t say we have toned down the aggressive nature of the pursuit; it\u2019s just simply a realization as we get here in July. It\u2019s going to be probably tough to get a lot of things done yet this year.", "Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets", "That\u2019s helpful. If I could just go back to Otis for a moment, the 8% decline in backlog, how do you measure that in months versus where we were in the beginning of the year?", "Akhil Johri", "Given the decline being of about 9% to 10% in new equipment revenues, I would say the 8% decline, the backlog is still about 12 months worth of revenues expected, based on the 8% to 10% decline that we have talked about on new equipment. So there\u2019s still about 12 months worth of backlog.", "Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets", "Great, and then any commentary regarding \u201cactivity,\u201d and then obviously, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve seen a lot in the way of push outs or deferrals, but any comments there would be helpful.", "Akhil Johri", "In China there is clearly a lot more interest, a lot more dialogue with the customers, project developers, etc. I would say geographically, Europe has been pretty consistent at a low level and same in the case of U.S., which had very, very touch compares in the second quarter, but the activity level is pretty stable at low levels there, but China and Asia is showing some increasing signs of discussions with customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "Your R&D, are you still looking for it down $100 million for the year, given that it was down as much, it was kind of as low as it was in this quarter?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes Cai. We were down $50 million or so and $53 million year-to-date. You remember, first quarter was essentially flat. We still expect down $100 million or so for the year. So probably it\u2019s third and fourth won\u2019t be as dramatic as what you saw in Q2, but we\u2019re also going to see a ramp up on spending in the back half of the year on the CSeries, as well as the MRJ. So, that will be good news.", "We\u2019ll see a little bit of a ramp down on 787, which will offset some of that. So I think the other piece is probably Columbus, with that being deferred by Cessna is also going to take some of the back half pressure down. So the $100 million still seems about right.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "So, you would still see a sequential build as we go through the year?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, absolutely.", "Akhil Johri", "It is a normal seasonality Cai in the engineering spend.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "Do you have any recovery from Textron for the cancellation of Columbus?", "Greg Hayes", "I do not believe that we have. I believe the program has been deferred as opposed to cancelled as a result. We\u2019re actually continuing to work on the core of that engine, because the core to the Columbus is the same core as we\u2019re using on the MRJ. So it\u2019s not as much of a savings as you might otherwise think from the deferral of that platform.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "You talked to Jeff\u2019s question about one third of the savings were kind of timing related things, like merit deferrals. So that\u2019s basically what, like $110 million, $120 million, something like that. Should we expect that timing impact to continue at that level in the third and the fourth quarters? You mentioned it\u2019s probably going to comeback at some point, how should we think about it coming back next year?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, clearly Cai. I think the pressure on cost is not going to let up this year and I would even tell you into next year, as we don\u2019t see a recovery in the markets, there\u2019s going to be this continuing focus on costs. It\u2019s really nothing new to UTC; we\u2019ve been doing this stuff for a long time. We\u2019ve done $3 billion of restructuring over the last 10 years.", "The furloughs and the merit deferrals, those are a little bit tougher, but I think you may well see some furlough activity next year if the aerospace markets don\u2019t recover. Merits obviously, that will comeback a little bit next year for headwind, but actually I wouldn\u2019t think all of that\u2019s going to comeback next year. You may see a piece of it obviously, but not the whole 30% or so.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "The last one; I mean you had this huge cash flow in the quarter and yet you didn\u2019t buy very much stock. Was that just timing that the cash flow came in the back part of the quarter, and you were blocked out because of reporting the earnings early on when the price was so low? How come you were so cautious on share buyback?", "Greg Hayes", "I would tell you, we entered the quarter after the kind of the disappointing first quarter cash flow performance and we were a little bit leery of ramping up share repurchase right away, until we saw what the markets were going to do. Obviously as the quarter progressed we started taking up share repurchase as the prices hovering there in the kind of low 50s, high 40\u2019s. ", "Also a big piece of the cash flow in this quarter came from collection activity. That\u2019s something really was back half of the quarter loaded. So, back half cash wasn\u2019t very strong. We also took the opportunity to fund the pension plan by that $400 million and we had planned to do $400 million for the year, but only going to do a couple of hundred million in the quarter. We saw the strong cash coming in. ", "The best thing to get behind us was the pension contribution that earns us 8.5%. Share repurchase, we will be aggressive in the back half of the year. With the price remaining in this mid 50\u2019s range, it is still a very, very good deal for us. So, I would expect to see that much more aggressive in the back half.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "On the overall restructuring gains, when you went to the lower end of the range, the $200 million to $350 million down to $200 million, what led to that? Is this just taking longer? Is the opportunity less?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, actually we had seen or had visibility to I\u2019ll say a sizeable back half gain that looks like it\u2019s just going to get pushed out into 2010 and because we had given the forecast of 250 to 350, as we were going to close out the quarter here, it really became apparent we weren\u2019t going to get this last transaction done this year. So, it\u2019s just a timing issue.", "Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "But what\u2019s pushing that back?", "Greg Hayes", "Just the completion of the deal and I really can\u2019t be more specific Doug, other than to say that it\u2019s a deal with we look to close sometime in the back half of the year, but probably won\u2019t see the gain until sometime next year.", "Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, and then on pricing you described the pricing benefit and then I would assume that Carrier, you\u2019re getting some benefit from efficiency incentives related to residential. If you look overall at Carrier and I would say also Fire & Security and Otis, what are you seeing as the pricing trends in the market and how are you responding to those trends today in term of your aggressiveness on pricing?", "Greg Hayes", "Pricing has become very difficult I would tell you, at Otis and the new equipment. It\u2019s always difficult in China; I would say there\u2019s been no let up there. We\u2019ve also seen pricing pressure in North America and in Europe and again as the volumes have come down; the competition has of course ratcheted up the price pressure. So we are seeing pressure there. Really no different at Carrier on the commercial side again, so we\u2019re still seeing price pressure there.", "As far as the efficiency from the stimulus program, we\u2019re actually seeing a big increase in our tier 15-plus product, more than 30% increase year-over-year in volume there, so that\u2019s actually been a plus for us, because obviously the higher tier product better margin for us, so not as much price pressure there. Still a lot of price pressure at the low end as you can imagine with the amount of excess capacity in the residential HVAC business here in the US.", "Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "One last thing on Hamilton Sundstrand, other than Sikorsky you talked about the least amount of restructuring effort, but it looked like there was a fair amount in Q2. What specifically are you going after in Hamilton Sundstrand in the restructuring area?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, I think there\u2019s really two areas; one is on the industrial side and they have been very aggressive in terms of taking out capacity on the industrial side and taking out people, as well as the Belmont has been just taking out overhead costs. ", "I think they\u2019re reducing overhead G&A type positions by 17% or 18% up there, so we\u2019re talking about structural takeout, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing up there and I think we spend over $50 million year-to-date up there on structuring and I would expect more in the back half of the year, as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "", "I want to go first to restructuring for a moment. When we look at the natural class statement Greg, when we look at SG&A as a percentage of sales, its 11.9% in the second quarter versus 11.1% in the year ago numbers. Now I know a chunk of it is the restructuring items in there. Can you give us a sense of what you\u2019d like to target for SG&A going forward, so that we can actually get a tangible sense of the improvement?", "Greg Hayes", "I think what you see in the quarter, if you get back out restructuring for both this year and last, you\u2019ll actually see that SG&A as a percentage of sales is down to about11.1 to 11.2 year-over-year. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to continue to see; is that trend of holding SG&A as a percentage of sales down slightly quarter-over-quarter. ", "Now if you think about taking out 17% of your revenues and holding SG&A flat to slightly down, that means we\u2019re taking out a huge amount of SG&A and I think that trend is going to continue here in the back half of the year.", "", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "So the goal really is that when volume comes back, it will just drop to the bottom line.", "Greg Hayes", "That\u2019s the idea.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Then to talk about inventories, this is always the promise and never quite the result. It always seems to be one area or another that\u2019s not. Could you sort of talk through some of the business units. I mean you talked about aerospace still being a challenge, what is it in particular? We\u2019ve seen this de-stocking at the back end of the channel fairly substantially. Why can\u2019t you get ahead of the curve?", "Greg Hayes", "I think in fact the businesses, especially Carrier and Otis have gotten ahead of the curve. Well if I look at Carrier performance year-over-year, their inventory is down over $600 million. Obviously the market is down, but even sequentially Carrier was down almost $200 million. Otis took inventory down, F&S took inventory down both sequentially and year-over-year. ", "The real challenge for us remains on the long lead aerospace side. I think that\u2019s the continuing frustration of inventory here and Pratt has been working very hard on it, but they still saw inventory go up sequentially just a little bit, and Sikorsky saw more than $200 million of growth on inventory.", "Really good work by Ari and his team on the commercial side in terms of giving inventory down. Jeff down at Sikorsky is faced with a different problem and that is a good problem of having a lot more volume. So his inventory continues to go up. I\u2019ll tell you, his turns are nothing special. They\u2019re aware of that and they\u2019re continuing to work on it.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Just a follow-up on Carrier; the fact that you were down sequentially $200 million with the usual seasonal build means the turns were up fairly sharply then.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "And then last, could you just talk about transportation a little bit? I mean, I remember at the analysts meeting, the surprise by Geraud, just how bad the numbers were. Could you talk about the environment and what you\u2019ve done to improve it, because I know those run sustain ably low levels.", "Greg Hayes", "The numbers that Geraud talked about back in March, where you talked about truck trailer and the container being down 70% or 80%, obviously they have recovered from that level. I think transit for the quarter was down, just about 40% or so, a little less, about 35% or 40% in terms of orders and we still see container being very, very weak. Truck trailer North America has gotten a little bit better and even in Europe truck trailer, we\u2019re starting to see some signs of some activity in that market.", "You got to remember; the underlying demand for refrigerated transport as best we can tell is only down 2% or 3% around the world. So the fact that we have seen this remarkable reduction in order rates, in my mind it is a temporary thing, because if demand is there, eventually we will see orders come back. Part of it is of course the credit markets. We\u2019ve been talking about this for the last few months as the unavailability of credit is really what\u2019s hurting that business.", "Shipping business of course is in trouble; there\u2019s a lots of excess capacity out there. Everybody is constrained by capital, but until the credit markets really free up and our customers have access to credit again, I think we\u2019re going to see a pretty tough market there. Again, that will come back. Underlying demand is not evaporated for refrigerated transport; that is foods and medicines being moved around the world. So we like the business long term, it\u2019s just a very tough year.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Just one last thing is, if you were to kind of look at all your businesses, are there any managers that are coming to you and saying I\u2019d like to either add some hours on direct labor or hire some people in direct labor? I know I\u2019m being optimistic, but I\u2019m sorry, this is one area you might see it first or in service at Otis.", "Greg Hayes", "I think service at Otis continues on the maintenance side to be a strong business, but we\u2019ll tell you, even at Otis we are taking headcount out as we continue to drive productive in that business. It is not the time to be adding direct labor or any kind of overhead right now into the business. Obviously, the idea here is to get productivity as the markets improving, not bring back all of the people that are being let go now. So I would tell you around the business, we are not adding much if any, anywhere.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "I wondered if you could talk a little bit about Europe. You\u2019ve talked about China coming back. What\u2019s happening in the developed economies of Europe and say in Northern Asia for you?", "Greg Hayes", "I think Europe has been very slow. When we look at both at Otis and at Carrier and we\u2019re not seeing like many signs of life in any of the European markets. I think Spain has been particularly bad, Italy not much better, Ireland of course has been down because of the housing bubble there. Eastern Europe still looks to be promising, although Russia with the commodity meltdown we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve seen a fairly large contraction in order activity.", "So I think our own view is Europe is probably behind the U.S. in terms of the timing of the recovery and we would expect to see it here first. So I just don\u2019t have much good things to say about Europe. I guess the tour to France is going on, so we can said that, but other than that, not much with the activity.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "Northern Asia?", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "Korea has come back a little bit. I think Otis actually saw some good traction there in Korea in the quarter. Japan not so much. Japan was down significantly, but as far as China, we already talked about China, but those were the two other big markets for us in Northern Asia.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "Then just switching to aerospace, Boeing and Airbus, perhaps surprisingly to many, continue to stick to their no cuts or if any modest cuts. Are you thinking along the same lines? Have you revised OE outlook upward other than 787 shipments or are you still thinking that Airbus and Boeing probably will have to make some cuts?", "Greg Hayes", "We\u2019re continuing to work with both Boeing and Airbus on the long lead production items. I think we all realize that with air traffic down 7% or 8% this year, there\u2019s probably a lot of excess capacity and at some point we believe that volume will have to comedown. At the same time you still look at the backlog, I think there\u2019s almost 7000 aircraft in backlog between the two. ", "So, long term demand remains strong, but we would not be surprised in fact if we saw a cut in production next year or at the latest 2011, but right now we\u2019re working very closely with them. I know they\u2019re both concerned about suppliers making cuts in productions, so they can\u2019t be supported. So we\u2019re making sure we\u2019ve got the long lead items in place, but I think from a financial planning standpoint, we\u2019re pretty cautious about the near term outlook I would say for production.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "On this small engines Greg, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been announced. Are you thinking that we\u2019ve kind of seen it and we get down to these new much lower run rates and then we kind of hang out there? Is the small engine business a place where there\u2019s another round of output? I\u2019m not talking any one guide, but just sort of collectively across the board here.", "Greg Hayes", "I think what we would fully expect is another down year, next year.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "You would get that if you just see; the back half of the year is just down from the front half and from Q4 last year. What I\u2019m asking is, now that you\u2019re down there, does it sort of hang out at those rates or does it take another notch down from sort of the Q4 levels?", "Greg Hayes", "I think what you\u2019re going to see is a continued reduction in the run rate of engine production at Pratt Canada. What\u2019s driving the bizjet market is the same thing that\u2019s driving our transport refrigeration business. So that is customers can\u2019t get credit. On top of that, the corporate profitability is a great precursor in terms of when bizjet production will increase. You wouldn\u2019t expect to see that probably until 2011 or maybe even 2012. ", "We\u2019ve also got of course a lot of used planes on the market, so it is a tough market. I would not be surprised to see run rates comedown again even into next year, as the OEMs build out their backlog this year and try and pull airplanes into this year for delivery to fill slots that they\u2019re building. So it\u2019s a pretty tough market and I would not expect it to be any better next year, probably a little worse.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company.", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company", "I was wondering if we could fix on Otis a bit in terms of the EPS guidance provision there. Nice upside to the prior expectation; obviously the top line coming in lower than previously expected. I know one of the moving parts would be 4X. Can you walk us through that $75 million to $125 million and improve that look at Otis on the EBIT side; how much of that is 4X?", "Akhil Johri", "Actually Myles, if you look at it there, revenue declines resulted in some margin impact as well and that has been pretty much more or less offset by the strong execution on the cost side and the restructuring and other actions that they\u2019re doing on the field performance. ", "So, big strong cost reduction benefits offset pretty much entirely the negative impact from volumes and then the improvement is pretty much all FX if you look at it. So benefits of cost reduction and field performance offsetting volume decline, FX improvement flowing through to be improved guidance.", "Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company", "So Greg, to putting context your prior comment about OE Otis being down maybe 5% next year in a constant 4X environment even under that scenario, could you see Otis up?", "Greg Hayes", "Absolutely. I think again just because OE production is down, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to stop driving costs out of the business. You also got to remember, 55% of that business comes from the service side, which traditionally continues to grow. ", "You\u2019ve got $1.6 million elevators under service contract around the world and that population continues to grow 2% to 4% every single year. So, between productivity improvements, cost reduction in our factories and the service side of the business, we would certainly expect Otis to grow earnings next year. ", "Myles Walton \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Could you give us a little bit of color on the portfolio shaping you\u2019re doing at Carrier. How much of these businesses that you\u2019re shedding or spending into JVs, where sources of restructuring spend in the past that won\u2019t be there on an ongoing basis and also kind of the size of the further portfolio shaping to come?", "Greg Hayes", "We\u2019ve taken about $1.1 billion of revenue out of Carrier on a run rate basis so far. That includes the transaction we did earlier this year with GL buyer to get rid of European commercial parts refrigeration distribution business. That includes the part that we joint ventured with Watsko and also the exiting of the commercial refrigeration business here in the US.", "In terms of restructuring, we\u2019ve done some restructuring as part of the exit of those activities. It has not been a source during the past of huge restructuring spend though, so I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be a kind of a year-over-year change in the restructuring.", "What we said all along is probably another $1 billion of additional revenues to take out and Geraud and Ari have been working on that. They\u2019ve talked about that plan I think at length. It takes time to execute, but I would think over the next 12, 18, 24 months you would see that continuation of the more focused Carrier start to emerge and again, it\u2019s not magic; it is just a lot of hard work and focus.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ron Epstein \u2013 Bank of America.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Bank of America ", "", "Greg, you\u2019ve been I guess very cautious about the economy in terms of talking about stabilization. What would you have to see to become more positive?", "Greg Hayes", "That\u2019s a great question Ron, because I think we all are looking for the positives in the economy. Clearly consumer confidence and the leading economic indicators are pointing upward. Unfortunately what\u2019s happening is that consumer spending or savings I should say, continues to soak up some of that good news out there in the economy.", "I think when we start seeing the credit return to more normal levels and when our customers aren\u2019t saying that \u201cLook, we\u2019d love to place an order, but we can\u2019t have access to credit,\u201d that will be the real sign for us and we\u2019ll see it in some of our short cycle businesses. We will see it at the transcycle, because again, underlying demand is there. I think we\u2019ll see it obviously in the housing market as well; and mortgage rates are at record lows here and we\u2019re still only talking about 550,000 or 560,000 new housing starts this year.", "So again, we hear some good news, there is some things out there that might give us confidence that things will get better, but quite frankly as we look at the order rates today and we look at the underlying unavailability of credit, I think we\u2019re still very cautious about any type of return to growth next year.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Bank of America ", "The Gear TurboFan, can you just give us an update on how that program is going and how the test one at Airbus and what we should think about it?", "Greg Hayes", "The tests last fall at Airbus, I think we\u2019ve gotten all of the data back and the test program exceeded everybody\u2019s expectations in terms of the fuel burn and in terms of the noise levels of the engine. I think everybody was very excited about those results. Right now we don\u2019t have an engine on test for the C-series, we won\u2019t have an engine on test for the C-series or MRJ until next year, but we are continuing with the development program. ", "We\u2019ve got about 20,000 cycles of testing now done on the gear set, which is of course the heart of the Gear TurboFan. As we\u2019ve taken that apart after those tests, it all looks excellent in terms of the predictability of the wear on the unit. So in making progress, spending is going ramp up, back half of the year will increase again, next year we\u2019ll get the first engine to test, but I\u2019ll tell you right now, we\u2019re all on track and there has been no showstoppers in terms of technology development.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley ", "Greg, I actually want to get your thoughts on sort of a bigger picture item on Pratt. Can you talk a little bit about what you see as sort of the long term margin potential structurally there? As we look at the puts and takes, I\u2019m just wondering about the feasibility of the high teen margins at Pratt. ", "I know it\u2019s been something you guys have long had a goal on and there\u2019s always something that interrupts it and every year you take restructuring charges and I know R&D is coming down, but as we think over the next several years with the installed base continuing to decline, it looks like the CFM engine venture really hasn\u2019t panned out. Pratt & Whitney Canada is coming down, your military engines volumes are probably flat up, but do you have the structural underpinnings to get to those eventual high teen margins?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. Heidi, I think if you take a look even at this quarter, if over 100 basis points of margin expansion in a market where you see Pratt Canada down 25%, spares down 25%, those are high margin businesses and we still had margin expansion. Dave Hess and the whole team over at Pratt are focused on this 20%. I think it\u2019s realistic.", "You\u2019ve got cost take-out and cost potential from low cost sourcing on the engineering side. You\u2019ve got low cost manufacturing that we\u2019ve done in Poland. You\u2019ve also got a very strong future because of the JSF, that\u2019s a huge program. We\u2019re not going to see a big benefit until probably 2013, but clearly there is margin upside to the 20%.", "Pratt\u2019s military engine business is great. The small engine business is wonderful and even the commercial business with the GTF, it will return to high levels of profitability in the future. So 20% is not out of the question, and Dave is not letting his foot off the gas there. They\u2019re going to get to it.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Can you refresh us as to what your installed fleet of large commercial aircraft engines is today and where it\u2019s going to be in the next couple of years by your estimates?", "Greg Hayes", "About 16,000 engines today that includes a few that of course have been part, for about 16,000 out in the fleet. That\u2019s obviously declining every year. Some of the old GT8s and GT9s get retired. I don\u2019t know that we have an actual forecast of fleet size, but we can get back to you with that.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "So, basically you\u2019re saying that the low cost sourcing and the manufacturing changes in Poland and the growing volumes in military are going to help more than offset the decline in the installed engines that you ask now?", "Greg Hayes", "If you think about it Heidi, we\u2019ve seen a dramatic decrease in profitability associated with a big piece of that installed base as the GT8s and GT9s. In 2001 that was $1 billion of revenue. Two years ago that was $350 million. This year it\u2019s going to be less than $200 million. ", "So I would tell you if most of that, which you would be concerned about, has already happened and Pratt has been able to overcome it and the V2500 parts continue to be very strong on that program, you\u2019ve enough other things in the hopper I think to offset this. Again they\u2019ve done good job overtime. It\u2019s not just something that just going to fall off the cliff right away.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "No, I don\u2019t say it\u2019ll fall off the cliff, but it\u2019s interesting to see what has happened between Hamilton Sundstrand in 2001 and Pratt & Whitney, where you\u2019re fighting a good fight at Pratt, but it seems it\u2019s always hard to kind of get above a sustainable 16% and higher.", "Volumes are doubled at Hamilton and gone from sort of 13%, 14% onto 17%, whereas Pratt & Whitney in the early 2000 and 2001 was doing 16% and 18% and now we\u2019re looking at 14%, 15%, so again with sales just about doubling. So I\u2019m just wondering; as we think about the global recovery and after market demand picking up, whether Pratt & Whitney was going to see whether that benefit is going to be feasible?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, we like this challenge. This is what we come to work for; to do every single day is to drive margin improvement in each of the businesses. Obviously Hamilton, they\u2019ve had a little bit better recovery over the last five or six years. They\u2019ve got more aircrafts around the world, but Pratt has done a tremendous job in terms of offsetting the decline in front of that old installed base and driving cost reduction. ", "You think about the low cost sourcing that the Pratt has done, it\u2019s been tremendous both on the engineering side and factory side. There is more of that to come. So 20% and Dave is going to get there.", "David Hess", "A minor point Heidi, also remember that collaboration accounting drives margins down effective this year by almost 100 base basis points for Pratt. That\u2019s just an accounting change, that\u2019s not operational.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Greg, will you give us a sense as to how many years from now we can look for that 20%?", "Greg Hayes", "That\u2019s a great question to ask Dave when you see him in next March.", "I want to thank everybody for listening into the earnings call today. Obviously a tough market out there, but I think what you\u2019ve seen here is tremendous execution across all of the businesses and 50 basis points of margin expansion in this market is really something remarkable. ", "So, I thank everyone for listening and we\u2019ll be in touch over the next couple of weeks. Thank you.", "Operator", "Once again, ladies and gentlemen that concludes our conference today.

On the call today are Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Akhil Johri, Vice President, Financial Planning and Investor Relations. ", "This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there's a presentation available for download from UTC's homepage at www.utc.com. ", "The company reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. (Operator Instructions)", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory Hayes", "Good morning everyone, as you saw in the press release this morning, no surprises in the fourth quarter. Three takeaways, first, solid execution with strong margin expansion on the back of sustained cost traction. ", "Secondly, commercial aerospace and long cycle commercial construction markets remain tough but we did see some improvement in our short cycle businesses. And finally, very strong cash flow performance as a result of our continued focus on working capital. ", "So the story remains the same, continuing to focus on structural cost reduction, process excellence in our factories and our supply chain and back office functions, as well as focused portfolio realignment and disciplined cash redeployment. ", "None of this is new. All of these actions contribute to full year segment operating margin expansion of 50 basis points to a record 14.3% adjusted for restructuring and one-time items. And we accomplished this in a declining revenue environment. ", "Free cash flow was 118% of net income and included $1.3 billion of global pension contributions, that\u2019s significantly more than we anticipated. UTC also announced strategic acquisitions such as GE Security while divesting lower return non-core businesses, particularly at Carrier. ", "Full year revenues were $53 billion, and that\u2019s down 11% year over year. Earnings per share were $4.12 and that\u2019s down 16% versus 2008. Absent restructuring and one-time items, earnings were down 8%. ", "Fourth quarter performance was solid across our businesses despite continuing end market weakness and we returned to EPS growth excluding restructuring and one-time items. Total segment operating profit grew 8% on a revenue decline of 3%. ", "And nowhere was this solid performance more evident than at Carrier, where portfolio rationalization and cost actions allowed operating profit to grow 34% in the quarter on a revenue decline of 12%. Four of six business units improved margins with Otis, Carrier, and Fire & Security increasing margins by more than 100 basis points each. ", "Sikorsky\u2019s 10.4% operating margin in the quarter puts it firmly on track to achieve its margin targets in 2010 and beyond. Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.15 and that\u2019s down 7%. Excluding restructuring and one-time items in both quarters, earnings per share increased 5% on 4% lower revenues. ", "foreign currency was a tailwind with an impact of about $0.04 from translation. Organic revenue declined 6% in the quarter with declines across all businesses except Sikorsky, which saw 22% organic revenue growth and delivered a record 84 aircraft in the quarter, brining the total to 244 large aircraft for the year. ", "restructuring and other charges were $135 million in the quarter, that\u2019s $830 million for the year. We continue to drive productivity throughout our operations and UTC\u2019s headcount is now down by nearly 18,000 since the beginning of the year before the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.", "Fourth quarter order rates remained stable although continuing at the low levels we saw in the third quarter. However as I noted before trends in our short cycle commercial businesses have improved. For example US residential gas furnace and split unit shipments were up 13% in the quarter.", "In addition new equipment orders in China grew about 15% for Otis and around 20% for carrier. Akhil will take you through the orders detail by business unit in a just a few minutes. In the quarter free cash flow was 107% of net income at $1.2 billion and that included $637 million of contributions to our global pension plans.", "Solid cash flow resulted from good working capital performance across the business. Inventory was again a source of cash. We reduced inventory by $550 million in the quarter on top of over $450 million in the third quarter. So more than a billion dollars of inventory out in the last half of 2009.", "share repurchase in the quarter was $320 million bringing the year to date total to $1.1 billion. Acquisition spend in the quarter was $146 million and just as a reminder we expect the GE Security deal to close early in the second quarter now. ", "We ended the year with a strong debt to capital ratio of 32% and that\u2019s down from 41% last year. So no surprises here. Just as we told you in December, it\u2019s a quarter where we saw continued margin expansion, excellent cash flow in a still difficult end market environment. ", "I\u2019ll come back and talk a little bit about 2010, but now let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit detail. ", "Akhil Johri ", "Thanks Gregory, turning to page three of the webcast, let me remind you that I will talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and non-recurring items as we usually do. ", "Otis had another exceptional quarter with profits up 20% despite a 1% decline in revenues. Operating margin expanded 390 basis points to 22%. Excluding currency and last year\u2019s charge for inventory and other adjustments in Brazil, profits grew 6% on 7% lower revenues due to aggressive cost reductions, lower commodity prices, and continued strength in the contractual maintenance business. ", "New equipment revenue was down 14% in the quarter excluding currency with declines in most major markets partially offset by a double-digit increase in China. [inaudible] revenue was about flat as continued growth in the contractual maintenance business offset declines in both modernization and repair.", "New equipment orders in the quarter were down 15% at constant currency. We saw growth in China where orders were up about 15%. Orders for Europe as a whole was flat while orders in North America were down around 50%. For the full year margins expanded by 250% to 21.8%. Operating profit was up 2% despite a revenue decline of 9% from swift cost reduction actions and commodity tailwinds. At constant currency operating profit increased 7% on 5% lower revenues. ", "On slide four turning to Carrier, consistent with guidance Carrier returned to profit growth in the quarter with operating profit up 34% on 12% lower revenues. This translates into 230 basis points of margin expansion bringing the margin to 6.7% for the quarter, the second highest Q4 margin in this last decade. ", "Carrier continues on the path of aggressive transformation to a simpler, more focused higher returns business. In Q4 the benefits of ongoing aggressive cost reduction and organizational restructuring combined with lower commodity costs, more than offset the impact of lower revenues. While organic revenues were still down 8% in the quarter, we are seeing improvement in the rate of revenue decline at Carrier. ", "In fact volume is up in the US residential HVAC and truck trailer businesses. Q4 shipments of US residential split and gas furnaces combined were up year over year for the first time since Q1 of 2006. For Carrier Transicold, in total orders were down only a little over 10% at constant currency, an improvement from the nearly 40% decline in the first three quarters of 2009.", "On the other hand, there was no meaningful change in the rate of decline of longer cycle commercial HVAC business where revenues were down mid teens organically and we saw new equipment orders there fall by about 20% at constant currency. ", "For the year Carrier results were in line with guidance with adjusted earnings down $523 million on 24% lower revenues. Operating margin for the year was down 170 basis points, however proactive cost reduction and restructuring actions contributed more than 275 basis points of margin and partially mitigated the impact of the steep volume decline. ", "UTC Fire & Security delivered another solid quarter with operating margin expansion of 130 basis points to a record 13.1% on 2% higher revenues. Organically revenues contracted 9% with high single-digit declines in both Fire Safety and Electronic Security. Foreign currency translation and net acquisitions increased revenue by 8% and 3% respectively. ", "Operating profit was up 14%. Excluding the impact of FX profits grew 5%. Fire & Security continues to realize the benefits of integration of the field operations, organizational [inaudible], restructuring, and cost controls. Despite the lower revenues productivity initiatives drove down overhead by more than 100 basis points in the quarter from a year ago. ", "Consistent with our guidance Fire & Security held profits flat year over year while revenues declined 14% resulting in 150 basis points of margin expansion for the year. Now turning to aerospace, on slide six, at Pratt & Whitney, revenues declined 9% in the quarter driven primarily by the lower overall after market volume and Pratt & Whitney Canada engine shipments. ", "Engine shipments were down at Pratt Canada over 30% from last year\u2019s strong fourth quarter. Large commercial engine spares were also down over 30% partly due to tougher compares as 2008 Q4 included the benefit from a [JB 90] distribution agreement. Book to bill in the quarter was about one. ", "Military revenues were up mid teens on higher engine deliveries. Operating profit at Pratt declined 9% in the quarter. The impact from lower revenues particularly of higher margin spares and unfavorable foreign currency at Pratt Canada was partially offset by fewer large commercial engine shipments, lower E&D and restructuring benefits. ", "Also you will recall that in the fourth quarter of 2008 Pratt & Whitney had recorded a favorable adjustment to a commercial engine program worth less than $0.02 of EPS. For the full year Pratt & Whitney operating profit declined 8% on 10% lower revenues. Operating margin at 16.1% was up 40 basis points for the year in spite of 25% decline in higher margin large commercial engine spares.", "On slide seven in the quarter Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were down 8% with Aero OEM down high single-digits, industrial businesses down low teens, and Aero aftermarket down slightly. Commercial spares revenues were down high teens with book to bill of about one. [inaudible] order rates remain depressed and were down over 35% as airlines continue to conserve cash. ", "Industrial orders were down slightly over 10% in the quarter on constant currency. However they were slightly higher on a sequential basis from Q3. Operating profit declined 14% primarily from greater volume reductions in the higher margin businesses and the absence of an acquisition related liability adjustment last year. ", "The decline was partially offset by lower E&D expenses primarily on the 787 program as expected. We continue to invest in the program although at a lower rate as Boeing moves towards certification and entering the service of the 787. ", "For the year Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were down 9% with operating profit down 13% from the decline in higher margin commercial spares and industrial businesses partially offset by benefits from restructuring and cost reduction actions. ", "Turning to Sikorsky, record levels were achieved in Q4 where revenue, operating profit, and aircraft deliveries. Operating profits grew 33% on 22% higher revenues. During the quarter Sikorsky shipped a total of 84 large helicopters, 57 based on military platform and 27 commercial. ", "Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 10.4% from higher helicopter shipments and product cost reductions. During the quarter Sikorsky\u2019s Black Hawk helicopter fleet surpassed one million flight hours in Iraq and Afghanistan without a single significant failure. ", "For the year Sikorsky delivered a record 244 aircraft, above the high end of its commitment of 230 to 240 aircraft deliveries. Consistent with the guidance last December operating profits grew 29% on 18% higher revenues. ", "Operating margin of 9.7% for 2009 is up 80 basis points year over year and as Gregory said, puts Sikorsky firmly on track to achieve its margin targets in 2010 and beyond. With that let me turn it over to Gregory for wrap up. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "Thanks Akhil, just on slide nine on the webcast, just to summarize 2009, excellent execution through structural cost reduction and portfolio realignment along with strong cash performance in a difficult end market environment. ", "Margins improved despite lower volumes and we positioned the business for continued margin expansion when volume does return. This is evident in our earnings per share conversion. Excluding restructuring and one-time items, EPS declined 8% on a revenue decline of 11%. ", "Free cash flow was 118% of net income and that included $1.3 billion of global pension contributions. We drove down working capital by over $1 billion and inventory was down 8% for the year on an organic revenue decline of 7%. ", "We also returned about $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends during the year. although 2009 was a tough year there was a lot of good progress made across our businesses. Otis improved its industry leading operating margins with best in class products, service, and operating performance. ", "Carrier completed two thirds of its portfolio realignment agenda with simpler more focused higher returns business. Fire & Security significantly enhanced its geographic and product breadth with the GE Security and GST acquisitions. Pratt & Whitney launched testing of a full-scale GTE engine core and delivered its final development JSF CTOL engine as it readies for decades of production. ", "Hamilton Sundstrand systems successfully supported the 787 first flight and Sikorsky continued to increase its production velocity with record aircraft deliveries in the fourth quarter and for the year. On ACE we achieved Louis\u2019 goal of 70% ACE gold and silver sights across the business by year-end 2009. ", "We also made significant progress towards deploying ACE at our key suppliers. In fact 50% of key supplier spend was at ACE gold and performing sites at the end of 2009. This is the type of performance that you\u2019ve come to expect from UTC and gives us confidence that we have positioned the company for earnings growth in 2010 and beyond. ", "Now turning to 2010, in December Louis provided EPS guidance range for 2010 of $4.40 to $4.65, that\u2019s growth of 7% to 13% on revenues of $54 to $55 billion. And we are affirming that guidance today. ", "Okay so let\u2019s take just a couple of minutes to talk about calendarization, first on organic revenue growth, while we still expect to see full year growth of zero to 2%, organic growth in the first half of the year could be flat to slightly down and we\u2019ll likely see a decline of 2% to 3% in the first quarter. ", "And while that is down that is still a significant improvement from the 6% organic revenue decline we saw in the fourth quarter. The pressure on growth come from the fact that we saw good backlog conversion into revenues in early 2009. ", "As an example Pratt & Whitney Canada shipped almost a thousand engines in the first quarter of 2009 and that dropped to about 700 by the fourth quarter and that\u2019s the rate we expect will remain through most of this year.", "Otis new equipment backlog is also down about 15% from last year and commercial Aero after market activity is only expected to pick up as the year progresses. In spite of these headwinds we expect restructuring benefits, a continuing focus on cost control, and favorable currency translation to provide earnings growth in the first half consistent with our full year earnings growth expectation of 7% to 13% growth. ", "On cash flow we continue to expect free cash flow equal to or in excess of net income. As Louis stated in December the acquisition placeholder is $3 billion and that includes the GE Security transaction. Share repurchase guidance is $1.5 billion for the year. ", "With our seasoned management team, structural cost reductions and significant after market content, we are well positioned to resume earnings growth and outperform in 2010. So let\u2019s stop there and open up the call for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank ", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank ", "Just to pick up where you left off can you just talk about how you expect restructuring net of gains to pace for the year. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "For the full year we\u2019re expecting about $350 million of restructuring, about $200 million in the first half probably spread evenly across those two quarters. We also expect gains for the year of about $100 million and I think we\u2019ll see about $25 million of gains here in the first quarter and then $75 sometime in the third and fourth quarter. So $250 net. ", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank ", "And then turning to Otis margins, can you maybe just talk about what you see on the OE pricing and maybe if you just throw in the OE margins, are you seeing any pressure on the OE margins within Otis and then if you adjust for mix normal mix of between OE and after market, where do you think the margins for Otis are, is this now a low 20\u2019s business. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "Let\u2019s start with the last part of that question, absolutely we think is a 20% plus margin business going forward. I think with the cost that the team have taken out over this past year and with the strong after market franchise, 20% is a goal that ought to be achievable not just for one year but on a continuing basis. ", "As far as pricing, pricing has been difficult. As you would expect with new equipment orders down 50% here in North America, we\u2019ve seen some very difficult pricing. And as a result I think you\u2019re going to see a little bit of pressure on new equipment margins coming into 2010. Saw pricing pressure in China, that\u2019s a continuing thing. Even in Europe we saw pricing pressure and in fact I think we have been, the team has been very disciplined. We lost a little bit of share in 2010 at Otis but I think we did not give up on pricing. ", "And that cost of share, but I think its good discipline for us to keep pricing where it is. ", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank ", "Can you just remind us on the other temporary cost reductions in 2009, how much of that is coming back in 2010.", "Gregory Hayes ", "Its about, there\u2019s about $750 million of call it temporary cost reductions, that\u2019s furloughs, merit deferrals, probably see about half of that come back in 2010. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan", "Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan", "Just first of all on the calendarization of the sales, is that different than six weeks ago or are you just giving a little bit more color on that now. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "No I think its exactly as Louis had explained, its just as we started to look, revenues have been getting better although still down throughout 2009 and that trend is going to continue where you\u2019re going to see slower growth in the first half than the back half. ", "We\u2019ve always talked about kind of a back half recovery in the economy so nothing new, just trying to get a little bit of specificity out there so we don\u2019t surprise people if we see earnings, but revenues down. Earnings will certainly be up in the first half but revenues could well be down especially in the first quarter. ", "Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan", "Is there anything that\u2019s changed, what would you highlight across all the businesses from when you gave your guidance six weeks ago.", "Gregory Hayes ", "I think what\u2019s changed in my mind is really some of the performance we saw at Carrier short cycle businesses where we saw really good traction I think in the US res business. We also saw good traction at Transicold in the truck trailer business in fourth quarter. ", "Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan", "And then just finally US res turned for the first time as you mentioned in I guess almost four years, do you think that\u2019s sustainable, do you think you\u2019ll be in the black every quarter in terms of growth rate in 2010.", "Gregory Hayes ", "I don\u2019t know that I want to comment or predict quarterly growth rates, but yes we do see growth throughout 2010 at Carrier in the res business. Its going to be on the back of housing and an economic recovery. ", "Akhil Johri ", "And certainly we can give more color on that certainly at the March meeting when we are together with you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Just on this phasing discussion, make sure I\u2019m clear, you\u2019re saying you would expect the 7% to 13% EPS growth for the full year to be consistent throughout the year and just to make sure we\u2019re on the right starting point, $0.78 Q1 2009 so we\u2019re sort of implying a range of $0.83 to $0.88 for the first quarter. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "That\u2019s how the math would work out but yes I think, what we\u2019re trying to do is just make sure everybody understands, first quarter is going to be a very tough compare versus last year on the revenue line because again we came out of 2008 with very strong backlog and still good production out of Pratt, so revenues are going to be a little challenged. ", "I think you\u2019re going to see good cost traction the first quarter, Sikorsky is going to have a good first quarter because they\u2019re not going to have the settlement costs from the union negotiation. We\u2019re getting good cost traction so yes, I think, I\u2019m not going to give quarterly guidance. I just want to make sure everybody understands, its just a tough compare. ", "But yes, 75 to 13% each quarter. ", "Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then on the commercial spares at Pratt, just wondering if you can calibrate what happened sequentially there and what you are expecting in the first quarter there. The down 30% was down more sequentially on a year over year basis but did the spares number go down sequentially as well and would you expect we\u2019re sort of running along the bottom here in the first half or could there be another leg down there. ", "Akhil Johri ", "We typically see a pick up in the fourth quarter of spares that is just the normal calendarization we saw that again this year. The reason why year over year compares were tougher was because of this agreement we had last year on JD90 which propped up these spares last year in fourth quarter. So if you adjust for that the year over year run rate would be about 25% which is consistent with what we have seen through the rest of the year. ", "And at some point the airlines will have to buy these spares, the question is when does that happen as traffic improves probably first half may be a little difficult but I think second half should be strong. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "We don\u2019t expect to see another leg down here in commercial air, I think its been, what we saw last year we think was the bottom. Airline profitability is still a challenge going into 2010 but we are seeing better inductions into the engine centers and we would expect to see spare pick up kind of gradually through the year. ", "Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And just to be clear, there really is nothing changed on your commercial after market view overall for Pratt and Hamilton relative to December, is that correct. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "That\u2019s right we still think they\u2019re kind of up 6%, 7% for the year about half of that on RPM growth and the other half on pricing. ", "Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then on China you had talked about China running a little bit better in December and the order rate that you called out on the commercial side certainly reinforced that, I\u2019m just wondering your take on the tightening efforts and what impact that might have on China in the second half of your 2010 year at this point in terms of what you\u2019re field people are telling you in terms of conversations with customers and so forth there. Do you think that we\u2019re going to see a little bit of a moderation in growth in some of those numbers in the second half or how are you looking at that now. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "What we are hearing from our folks in China is that the bank lending is starting to tighten. I think we\u2019ve seen that across the headlines here for the last couple of weeks and that\u2019s really focused on trying to keep some of the economic growth, the factories, and some of the residential housing prices in check to eliminate the possibility of an asset bubble there. ", "We\u2019re still seeing good order intake though on the infrastructure and on the low end housing market which is where Otis plays primarily as well as Carrier so, we\u2019re still expecting a good full year 2010. In fact, they\u2019re still going to spend $250 billion of stimulus in China this year on the infrastructure projects on that low end residential housing so again, the idea there is you\u2019ve got to keep growth from getting out of control, but I think we still are expecting 9% to 10% GDP growth evenly throughout the year there. ", "Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "At the total commercial level, is there a way, can you call out what growth in China was overall in 2009 and maybe what you would think is a reasonable range for 2010 to calibrate us there. ", "Akhil Johri ", "I can give you the specific details later on. I think for the fourth quarter we saw it roughly 15% to 20% kind of growth in the order rates across all our commercial businesses and I think in terms of revenues because there\u2019s a little bit of a lag probably a little less than that but still pretty good growth, double-digit growth in China across in revenues and 15% to 20% on orders. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "Just to be clear orders were down for the year. Otis orders in China were down about 15% for the full year. For Carrier it was down almost say about 10% to 12% for the year so it was a very tough first half.

", "Akhil Johri ", "I think, let\u2019s start with divested revenues first, there is about $500 million of divested revenue impact next year, that\u2019s just for the annualized effect of divestitures done in 2009. There is organic growth of low single-digit, call it 3% or so in the assumptions overall and the breakdown of that would be double-digit growth in US residential, 10 to 20% sort of level for transport refrigeration, offset by a decline in commercial HVAC.", "David Strauss - UBS Securities", "And at Otis are you still thinking on the new equipment side down mid to high single-digits. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "Yes I think given where we ended the year with orders down and backlog down about 15% it will probably be towards the higher end of that range on the downside, probably closer to 9% or so down for the year. ", "David Strauss - UBS Securities", "And the guidance you gave for 2010 back at the investor conference I think you talked about $0.20 to $0.25 contingency at the mid point obviously the dollar has moved a little bit against you since then, is there anything that\u2019s made up for that move in the dollar or have you [inaudible] into your contingency a little bit. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "When Louis stood up we talked about a contingency at the mid point which is about 10% growth where we had about $275 million of contingency. I think the euro this morning is about 141 versus our guidance of 148 and that\u2019s cost us let\u2019s call it $75 million but we had to have some good news on the pension plan, the discount rate on the pension we had assumed 5.7 back in December ended up being around 6% for the US plan. ", "We also had a little bit of returns, we did a little bit more funding for the pension plan so add all that up and it gives us about $50 million of benefit versus the guidance that we gave you in December, so that\u2019s a long way of saying contingency is probably about 250 today at the mid point.

That\u2019s a very large contract that\u2019s up for bid right now. We\u2019re competing with [Augusta Westland] so I think we\u2019ll hear on that contract shortly. ", "But the key for us on the international Black Hawk is low cost sourcing and low cost manufacturing and we\u2019re gearing up in Poland to build the international Black Hawk there. Significantly lower cost obviously than Stratford so we think there\u2019s a huge market out there. The US market, the European market is pretty well spoken for but international Black Hawk still opportunities we think in Taiwan, and Singapore. ", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jeffries & Co. ", "From time to time the JSF has been a topic and this might be a good opportunity for you to sort of give us an update on the progress on the engine and how well its going so that you kind of eliminate some of the confusion. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "I don't think there\u2019s any, there shouldn\u2019t be any confusion on the development of the engine, the engine has performed beautifully in the flight test program. We had a little hiccup about a year ago with a blade but I think all of that is behind us and we are on track. We are delivering engines under the [L rip] program right now. The [Stouvall] version is in test. That\u2019s also performing very well so we see nothing but upside on that program right now from an engine standpoint. ", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jeffries & Co. ", "And then second, when you look at your outlook for Carrier how are you weighing the risks of the stimulus for housing abating and maybe the market petering out, how are you balancing that risk versus the 550,000 units a year. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "The 550,000 was obviously a low point and we do expect modest growth I would tell you in housing this year but if you think about US res its really becoming add on replacement market, over 80% of the revenues in res now come from add on replacement so new housing starts make up a very small percentage of total revenue there. ", "Again AOR as we would call it is really more dependent upon overall economic growth as opposed to growth in housing so housing price stabilization is important I think for consumer confidence and we expect all of that to be positive this year but not in a big way. ", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jeffries & Co. ", "So you\u2019re sort of sizing for, I know you, modest growth but you kind of looked at the downside and feel like some of this stimulus is, are you just being careful that if some of the stimulus has a transitory effect it won\u2019t impact your business plans.", "Gregory Hayes ", "Yes, I think Carrier is pretty calibrated on the res side. We don\u2019t expect much impact from the elimination of the housing tax credit here.

The container business is still down year over year in orders but a lot better than the 80% number that we quoted in the past. So clearly some signs of improvement there. ", "Like the US HVAC residential market, I think we believe transport refrigeration is probably an early indicator and that\u2019s an encouraging sign. ", "Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets ", "And then the other early indicators you say are the residential [A track] business of Carrier, we\u2019ve got a different dynamic this year with the [Watts Co] joint venture is there anything in terms of how we\u2019ll be watching inventories in the channel, will it be more difficult for us to track that and what is the assessment of inventories today. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "I think our visibility in inventories remains the same. Remember this is a joint venture we have with [Watts Co] called Carrier Enterprises, so we still see what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and as we continue to divest out of some of the distribution we\u2019ll continue to have equity stakes in these ventures to give us visibility. ", "Inventory is down across the channel and I think that\u2019s actually an encouraging sign for us because when we see any pick up in economic activity we\u2019re going to have our factories back up and running to support that. So I think its down in line with the market but upside for us for the year. ", "Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets ", "And then just to clarify you updated the numbers on restructuring expectations for 2010 and can you just reaffirm on the saving for expected incremental savings on the carryover from 2009 and then the new restructuring initiatives on 2010.", "Akhil Johri ", "We have about $350 million of savings in 2010 from the restructuring actions taken in 2009 and a little bit from the 2010 program that we have on the [inaudible].

", "Gregory Hayes ", "I think 2010 you\u2019re looking at probably less than $50 million of incremental savings this year. Most of that payback is going to really come in 2011 and 2012 as we\u2019re taking on some of the longer restructuring sort of the more structural things like factories and such that you don\u2019t see the payback right away but its still maybe about $50-ish million this year.

We\u2019re not looking to do a big deal. What we\u2019re looking for are more deals like [inaudible] Wind Power where we can add to some of our capabilities and take advantage of some good valuations and you may see more smaller deals like that during the course of the year but more in the core, we\u2019re not looking for the big deal.

The program, the C Series program continues on track, lots of talk out there in the market about the C Series. MRJ, that program has slipped a little bit as you know but the engine continues to work. And we\u2019re working with the other OEMs as well on potential re-engining opportunities and I think there\u2019s lots of pull from airline customers for what the GTF has to offer which is 10% to 15% better fuel burn and lower noise, lower emissions, and all those good things.

The level I would say is also consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past years and the pricing realization is also consistent with what we see every year so no new news there, no surprises, everything as you would expect. ", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo ", "And then the $577 million reduction in inventories in the fourth quarter can you talk about where that mostly came out of and as we think about a recovery in the businesses during 2010 are you going to be able to hold inventories at these levels or should we start to see that growth in 2010 versus 2009. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "That\u2019s clearly the challenge is to keep inventories in check and to improve turns as we see some of the demand come back. In terms of the reduction for the fourth quarter about $450 million of that let\u2019s call it 550 ex acquisitions and all that, 450 came from Carrier, Pratt, and Sikorsky. That\u2019s good news at Sikorsky, and you would expect that on those high shipments. ", "Otis also had a good quarter taking out almost $90 million of inventory so really good in fact each one of the businesses actually took out inventory during the fourth quarter so good performance across all the businesses. ", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo ", "The deferred income tax line of the $415 million or so in terms of the cash, what is that related to in the fourth quarter.

How do you think that shook out. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "I think in total it was a net negative to the year. We had big absorption across most of the businesses as you can imagine with Carrier\u2019s volume down as much as it was. At Hamilton I think the absorption impact was over $100 million alone and there was a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter from LIFO that came partially from divesting of some of those Carrier distribution businesses but also just on the lower volume. ", "So on a net basis I would tell you it was a big negative. ", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup ", "The flipside of Howard\u2019s question on stimulus, stimulus for energy retrofit on commercial has been AWOL, have you seen any uptick in energy performance contracting or anything on the commercial side that mutes the negative headwinds in 2010 on commercial OE.", "Gregory Hayes ", "We\u2019ve certainly seen some good traction at the [Norersco] business which is the energy services contracting business that we bought in late 2008. They\u2019ve got a very strong backlog. The problem there is it\u2019s a $200 million or so business as compared to the total totality of the commercial HVAC business so its going to be improving this year. ", "We have seen good traction on the government side which is where they focus. But in terms of stimulus impacting or energy efficiency impacting the rest of the PSS, its really pretty moderate.", "Akhil Johri ", "The only real benefit has been in the US residential business where the mix is better because of the rebate for [15 inaudible] equipment. That has driven the mix up which has helped the margin a little bit, again not meaningful but has certainly been the most positive impact. ", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup ", "And then on Carrier resi in particular can you give us a little color on how price cost dynamics are playing out. Obviously everybody is hearing some footsteps on cost and we\u2019re running at real low utilization rates, what do you think is the shape of pricing as the year unfolds here, what\u2019s going on in the channels right now. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "I think pricing is probably the one question mark we have and maybe the biggest risk as we think about Carrier for the year. As volumes pick up we know that there\u2019s excess capacity in the channel out there. I think the good news from a Carrier perspective on a cost side over the last year and a half Carrier has actually reduced the break-even point of the big res factory in Tennessee from about a 50% volume to 25%. ", "So we think we\u2019ve got a cost advantage out there. Obviously copper could be a headwind if we see that start to pick up here as we have in the last quarter but from a cost perspective I think we feel pretty good. Pricing is the great unknown and again we have to stay disciplined, just like Otis stayed disciplined last year. I think Carrier is going to have to remain disciplined and not give up on pricing. ", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup ", "And on GTF, obviously there\u2019s been a lot of development dollars expended along the way here for years as you work on this, but if one of the big commercial OE actually hits the bit if you will on a re engining program, what kind of inflection in E&D spending would that trigger as it relates to the GTF. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "Obviously there would be a big bill associated with any re engining of one of the large commercial transport, be it the 737 or A320, the good news of course is we have partners out there that would absorb a big chunk of that but you would see and inflection. You probably wouldn\u2019t see it in 2010, its probably more a 2011 phenomenon because even if something that was selected this year, to ramp up spending, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see it until 2011 and really probably even 2012, 2013 before you get to the bigger dollars.

I think the question is how much of it goes to the partner share and how much of it ends up on our P&L but if you think about it Pratt spends about $700 million a year on E&D now so obviously other programs will go down. This will replace a piece of that spending but you\u2019ll probably still see an incremental number, but you\u2019re not talking about $ 2 or $300 million a year.

", "Gregory Hayes ", "Are you specifically concerned about JSF production in the next couple of years, is that\u2014", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "It would be, so as we get out to 2012-ish, 2013 before we have GTF contributing if there\u2019s less JSF engines if the F16 is going down, C17 is going down, and you have R&D at a relatively high level for the GTF, is there a growing concern that Pratt would be flat or do you think that Pratt Canada and after market and restructuring can still give you growth during that period. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "There\u2019s no doubt I think 2011 will be kind of a low point on the military engine business, you\u2019re going to see the engines for the F22, they start to go away after this year. JSF does not ramp up to replace all of that until 2013, 2014. I think Pratt is going to be challenged next year but to your point, we\u2019re going to see benefits from restructuring next year. ", "You\u2019re going to see a little bit of recovery in spares continue and you\u2019re going to see better outlooks from Pratt Canada. So again it\u2019s a little early to give guidance out of 2010 but I think Pratt understands the challenge and the military is certainly going to be a headwind for them in the next couple of years. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Question on Hamilton Sundstrand, if you could give me a little bit more color I know we saw a 10% decline in revenues and a 32% decline in profits, clearly weaker in spares and you gave us color on industrial and commercial but can you add even more color on what we saw and talk about the sustainable margins in 2010. ", "Akhil Johri ", "I think for Hamilton the numbers you quoted were reported numbers so when you adjust for restructuring and Hamilton did a lot of restructuring as you would expect in this environment, I think the numbers are closer to down 13% for the year on earnings. That primarily is because of the, both their spares business and their industrial business were down about 20% for the year, year over year on revenues. ", "That\u2019s a big decline on their highest margin businesses. So that put a lot of pressure on it. They did do a lot of cost actions like everybody else, furloughs, travel restrictions, and restructuring, all that gave them about $200 million of good news in the year but that wasn\u2019t enough to offset the declines from the higher margin businesses. ", "Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "I\u2019m sorry those numbers I quoted I backed out the restructuring and I still found that it fell short but it was just the significant weakness more in the commercial side.", "Akhil Johri ", "Commercial spares and industrial. ", "Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "And then what about what we should think about then about margins in 2010 and also touch on when will we see provisioning spares on the 787 ramp up, does that happen in 2010.", "Gregory Hayes ", "No I don\u2019t think so, I think margins ought to be up at Hamilton this year just on the back of the cost reduction that Akhil talked about. Revenues will be challenged there again primarily because of the regional jets going down as well as some of the military vehicles that have been a big piece of the revenue for the last couple of years. ", "So, they\u2019re going to be challenged on the top line but cost reduction will actually give them some margin expansion this year. As far as provisioning, provisioning was as big piece of the after market. We saw that down significantly last year and don\u2019t expect it to pick up much this year and specifically on the 787 with entry into service probably here towards the end of 2010 we wouldn\u2019t expect a big uptick in provisioning orders in 2010 especially since the first customer which is ANA, they\u2019re actually on our long-term, we call it a care program, where they don\u2019t actually provision but they just pay us a fee for the provisioning. ", "Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Okay so that\u2019s something we can anticipate for next year.", "Gregory Hayes ", "Yes.", "Heidi Wood \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "And then on GTF another way that I\u2019m wondering about is how do we think about the risk to the C Series given that Boeing and Airbus have lodged complaints on [inaudible] subsidies even though that is a little like calling the kettle black. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "I think its actually a great testimony to how good the GTF is that Boeing and Airbus are concerned about the C Series. So I think again it\u2019s a good aircraft. Bombardier is going to have it to market ahead of any re engine A320 or 737 and we think there\u2019s nothing but upside with GTF. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton \u2013 Oppenheimer ", "Myles Walton \u2013 Oppenheimer ", "Good quarter, question for you on the cash side of the house, you obviously added another $500 million on the, I think you had placeholder for 2010 of $400 domestic $200 million international, I assume the international hasn\u2019t changed. Has the domestic. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "We did a lot of prefunding in December as you noted, we still have a $400 million placeholder out there and I think again cash ought to be strong again this year so we\u2019re still anticipating another $400 million but it really depends I think on the market and cash but $400 is a good placeholder for now. ", "Myles Walton \u2013 Oppenheimer ", "And the other cash item was on CapEx, obviously you pulled back the reins pretty hard in 2009 on CapEx do you go back in 2010 to more of the $1.2 or equal to D&A kind of rate. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "No I think, CapEx was down a little over 30% last year. obviously all the businesses, we saw the economic environment they tightened up and Louis put out an [inaudible] out there to cut back on CapEx. The guys executed on that. You\u2019re going to see a little bit of an increase this year, not back to the levels that we saw in 2008 but you\u2019re going to see a little bit of uptick in CapEx year over year. ", "Akhil Johri ", "There are a few program related investment that need to be made, for example in Pratt you see the setting up of the Turkish and the Shanghai engine centers, so there is some CapEx which got pushed out from 2009 into 2010 which will put a little pressure but we don\u2019t expect it to be any where close to the $1.2 billion. It will maybe be a double-digit increase but not much more than that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "", "Could you on Carrier walk through some of the actions that have been taken, I know you\u2019ve done a lot on headcount reduction, you\u2019ve talked about R&D consolidation, exiting underperforming businesses, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of where you are right now in terms of actions that have pretty much been completed and what you have ahead of you in the next year or so. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "As we said in the opening comments we think we\u2019re about two thirds of the structural work has been done at Carrier. The other third is still to come. I think the key and Geraud will take you through this in more detail in March is you\u2019re going to see some more on the international res, we\u2019ll be exiting some of those, and of course just continuing down the path on the US distribution business and we\u2019ll probably see more of that here in the first half. ", "But the big tough things have been done. I would say the heavy lifting is behind us but still some more, and again Geraud can give you a lot of detail here and he\u2019ll spend some time in March on that. ", "", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "And then similarly on Fire & Security, I know one of the things that [inaudible] has emphasized was the need to do consolidation around service centers, where are you on that, is this at a point where its being implemented or are you still in the planning stages for that work.", "", "Gregory Hayes ", "No we\u2019re going full tilt there. We started last year in France, we\u2019ve got some more teed up around Europe this year. You\u2019re going to see in fact a big piece of the restructuring cost this year are going to be at Fire & Security not just for GE Security but also to continue on the branch office consolidation. That ought to be wrapped up by the end of 2010 or so. ", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "So we should actually see savings impact from that in 2010. ", "Akhil Johri ", "Some savings from the actions, as you can imagine this is a geographic business so we started actions in Australia, we\u2019ve seen benefits from that. There are actions in France as Gregory talked about we\u2019re just starting to see some benefits in 2010. Bulk of the benefits will come in 2011 and 2012.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of George Shapiro \u2013 Access 342 ", "George Shapiro \u2013 Access 342 ", "I wanted you to run through sequentially both at Pratt and Hamilton Sundstrand the margin was down despite revenues being up and I thought I heard you say that normal seasonality is that the spares are up a little bit sequentially in Q4 versus Q3, so I\u2019m just looking for the reason for the margin decline. My guess is maybe its more OE zero margin engine deliveries but if you could provide the color.", "Akhil Johri ", "Let\u2019s take Pratt first, the normal seasonality on the spares is also followed by seasonality in E&D where E&D ramps up in fourth quarter typically so we saw from Q3 to Q4 an increase of approximately $50 million in the Pratt E&D number. The second thing to keep in mind there is if you go back to our third quarter call we mentioned a one-time benefit in Pratt numbers associated with several contract adjustments.", "We talked about a $35 million number there which was on a year over year basis, in the quarter the number was more $50 plus so if you take those two factors into account, higher E&D and the one-timer in Q3, you pretty much explain the margin change there. ", "And for Hamilton actually sequentially there is really no change in the margin. the margin is pretty consistent, about similar level of profit on similar level of sales. The little decline there is also a function of E&D being higher in Q4 as compared with Q3. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "", "Maybe just to close, just a final word on 2009, a great year for execution. Its positioned UTC for earnings growth in 2010 and beyond. Thanks for listening today. We appreciate your time. We look forward to seeing everybody in March at our annual investor meeting.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Akhil Johri, Vice President, Financial Planning and Investor Relations.  This call is being [carried] live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's homepage at www.utc.com.

You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and then we will answer those questions as additional time permits.  ", "Gregory Hayes", "Thank you Tricia, and good morning everyone.  ", "As you saw in the press release this morning, a great start to the year with strong performance across the business in a tough but improving end market environment.  Some key take-away from this quarter:  first, cost traction continues, resulting in margin expansion at each of the businesses.  Second, we are seeing improvement in order trends and continued strength in our short-cycle business.  And finally, we saw strong cash generation in the quarter.", "If you recall, in our March investor meeting, we expressed confidence in our original EPS guidance provided back in December.  This pressure from the euros weakness was partially offset, the benefits from pension, the early closing of the GE Security Deal, and strength in our short-cycle businesses.  ", "Since that time, the euro has weakened a little bit more, but the continuing strength of cross-traction, and a broader improvement in order trends has increased our confidence in the outlook.  As a result, we are going to raise the low end of our EPS guidance range to $4.50 from $4.40.  So we now expect EPS to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.65.  That's up 9% to 13% from 2009, and revenues still expected to be around $54 billion to $55 billion, up 2% to 4%.  ", "Getting back to first quarter results, performance was solid across our businesses, with segment operating margin expansion of 180 basis points with 14.2% adjusted for restructuring.", "On that same basis, total segment operating profit grew 13%, and a revenue decline of 1%.  All six business units improved margins with Carrier, Otis and Sikorsky leading the way.  Carrier's margin expansion of 390 basis points reflects strong progress from its restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives, in addition to the benefits of the relatively easy compare given the very rough Q1 in 2009.", "Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.93.  That's up 19%, and includes a charge of a little more than a penny of the recently enacted healthcare legislation which eliminated the Medicare Part-D tax subsidy. Restructuring costs were $67 million; that's slightly below the net $75 million that we had expected.", "Excluding restructuring costs in both quarters and the one-time gain in last year's first quarter, earnings per share increased 13% on 1% lower revenue.  Foreign currency was a benefit of $0.06.  That's from translation and the positive impact of currency hedges at Pratt & Whitney Canada.  Foreign currency translation also favorably impacted revenues by 3%.  ", "Organic revenues declined by 4% in the quarter.  That's a slight improvement from the 6% decline was saw in the fourth quarter.  We expected organic revenues this quarter to be down, as last year's first quarter benefited from a strong backlog.  ", "The best example is probably Pratt & Whitney Canada which shipped nearly 1000 engines in the first quarter of 2009, compared to 633 this quarter.  That's down 35%.  That's the lowest quarterly rate we expect this year at Pratt Canada, and for the full year, we still expect Pratt Canada to ship about 2800 engines.", "Now on Slide 2, on orders.  While first quarter organic revenues were down, first quarter order rates showed marked improvement with continued strength in most of our short-cycle businesses.  Carrier\u2019s U.S. residential shipments and Transicold orders were up year over year with strong improvement in truck, trailer, and containers.", "In China, [inaudible] orders across our commercial business units grew by 40% and other emerging markets such as India and Brazil also saw strong improvements.  Initially at Hamilton, we saw growth in the commercial aero aftermarket and at their industrial businesses.  ", "Not surprisingly, commercial construction related orders, particularly in North America, remain weak.   Akhil will take you through the details of orders by business unit in just a few minutes.  ", "Now on Slide 3, in the quarter free cash flow of 116% of net income, our focus on working capital and control over CapEx continues to pay off, and we drove solid cash flow performance.  Working capital terms improved to 8.3 even in the face of lower revenues.  Capital expenditures to depreciation was slightly below 70% in the quarter.  ", "Share repurchase in the quarter was $500 million; a strong start to this year's program, as we continue to believe that our shares are attractively priced.  Acquisitions spend in the quarter was $2.1 billion.  That's primarily from the GE Security, and Clipper Windpower transactions.", "So no surprises.  Just like we told you since December, the strong quarter where we saw continued market expansion and excellent cash flow in difficult but improving end markets.  We'll come back and talk a little bit more about 2010, but for now let me turn it over to  Akhil to take you through the business unit details.  ", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Greg.  Turn to Page 4, let me remind you that I will talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and nonrecurring items, as we usually do.  ", "Otis delivered an exceptionally strong first quarter with profit growth up 15% on 2% higher revenues.  Operating margin, expanded 240 basis points to 22.2%, as the benefits of aggressive cost reduction actions over the past years and continued strength in contractual maintenance more than offset the impact of lower new equipment volume. ", "At cost and currency, revenues went down 3% while operating profit was up 8%.  New equipment sales went down 7% as a strong rebound in China was more than offset by a continued decline in North American and Europe.  Service revenues went down slightly with growth in the contractual maintenance business offset by lower modernization and repair volumes.", "New equipment orders resumed growth for the first time since second quarter of 2008, and went up 9% [inaudible] a year, and up 3% on cost and currency.  The increase was driven by China, where orders were up close to 50% from a bleak first quarter of 2009; partially offset by a 30% decline in North America.", "Orders in Europe remained flat for the second quarter in a row.  While the foreign exchange benefit in the first quarter is expected to be more than offset by headwinds in the latter part of the year, based on the solid cost traction and strong orders in China, we now expect Otis fully a profit growth to be at or above the high end of our prior guidance range of $75 million to $100 million on flattish revenue.", "On Slide 5, Carrier continued this transformation to a high returns business and posted another quarter of record margin expansion.  Profit grew 149% on 2% lower revenues, resulting in 390 basis points of margin expansion.  This was largely driven by carry-over benefits of the aggressive cost reduction and organizational restructuring, strong volume, and earnings conversion in parts of the business, and lower commodity costs.  ", "One time impact of new divestiture related transactions reduced profit by about $20 million.  Consistent with expectations, organic revenues were up 2% in the quarter, following 18 months of contraction.  First quarter shipments of U.S. residential systems were up high single digits year over year; the second consecutive quarter of growth.  ", "Although all the rates in the longer cycle commercial HVAC business in the Americas and Europe were down in the low teens at cost and currency, all of the rates in China were up mid teen.  Transicold orders were up for the first time since third quarter of 2008, up over 35% at cost and currency.  Container and truck filler orders nearly doubled, albeit from a low base.  ", "I'm sure you remember these segments had significant drops in orders last year.  While the cooling season is still in front of us, based on the solid start, we now expect areas of operating profit growth for the year to be at or above the higher end of our prior guidance range of $150 million to $175 million.  Based on the solid stock, we now expect Carrier\u2019s operating profit growth for the year to be at or above the higher end of our prior guidance range of $150 million to $175 million.", "UTC Fire and Security delivered operating margin expansion of 110 basis points on 10% higher revenues.  Organically revenues contracted 8% with double digit decline in Fire [Safety] and a mixed single digit decline in electronics security.", "Net acquisitions ran [laterally] from the acquisition of GE Security on March 1 contributing 10 points of revenue growth.  Foreign currency translation increased revenues eight% year over year.  By first quarter orders declined organically at a low single digit rate overall.", "The rate of decline continued to improve sequentially.  Orders in Asia and the Fire products business increased year over year in the quarter.  Operating profit grew 24% including 11 points from favorable FX and 20 points from the GE Security acquisition.", "The large negative impact from low organic revenues was partially offset by the benefits of integration of field operations, restructuring and cost controls.  For the full year, we continue to expect revenues to be up 20% plus and operating profit up $225 million to $215 million.", "Turning to the aerospace businesses on Slide 7.  At Pratt & Whitney revenues declined 9% in the quarter driven by lower overall after market volumes and significantly lower OEM shipments at both Pratt & Whitney Canada and power systems.", "[Inaudible] revenues was flat while favorable currency conversion at Pratt Canada contributed three points to revenues.  Large commercial engines spares revenues were down mid-teens while book to bill was slightly above 1.", "As Greg said, Pratt Canada engine shipments were down 35% from a strong first quarter last year.  Operating margin at 16% was 30 basis points higher than prior year.  The impact from lower revenues, particularly of high margin spares was more than offset by restructuring benefits, favorable foreign currency at Pratt Canada and lower E&D.", "Recent improvements in air traffic trends are consistent with our expectations of high commercial after market revenues in the back half of 2010 and for the full year we remain confident in Pratt\u2019s operating profit increase of $75 million to $100 million on low single digit growth and revenues.", "In the quarter Hamilton Sundstrand operating profit grew 6% on 3% lower revenues.  aero OEM revenues were down high single digits while aerospace aftermarket and commercial spares were both up low single digits.", "Industrial revenues were also up slightly.  Commercial spares orders were up low double digit versus the weak first quarter 2009 levels.  Book to bill was slightly above 1.  Industrial orders increased mid-teens on a constant currency basis. ", "Orders improved across all industrial businesses with over 20% growth in the [inaudible] compressor business, a positive sign as this segment has been a leading indicator.  Operating margin expanded 130 basis points, reflecting the benefits from restructuring, cost control, and lower E&D, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues.", "For the full year we continue to expect Hamilton Sundstrand\u2019s operating profit to be up $25 million to $50 million and revenue up slightly.  On Slide 9 turning to Sikorsky, operating profits grew 25% on 2% higher revenues.", "During the quarter Sikorsky shipped a total of 51 large helicopters, 24 based on military platforms, and 7 commercial, reflecting the continuing strength of the military business and the weakness in the commercial markets.", "Operating margin expanded 190 basis points in the quarter with 10.6% from favorable mix of military and aftermarket shipments and the absence of approximately $20 million first quarter 2009 payment off a union contract ratification bonus.", "The [inaudible] was slightly higher in the quarter.  Final assembly on the first international Black Hawk was completed in March at [Mielec, Milicz] in Poland.  This new radiant uses a global supply chain and is the first Black Hawk helicopter assembled in Europe.", "We remain confident in Sikorsky\u2019s 2010 guidance with deliveries of 250 to 260 large helicopters.  Revenues up high single digits and operating profit up $100 million to $125 million.  With that let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.", "Gregory Hayes", "Okay, thanks Akhil.  Well, a very solid quarter.  Great cost performance, great margin expansion and all of that came with good cash conversion as well.  And [size of life] in the end markets.", "Some other highlights from the quarter, I think most importantly we closed out the GE security acquisition.  The F&S team is now focused on the hard work of integration of this really wonderful property into the F&S family.", "Carrier continues to implement its portfolio transformation agenda as well.  Since the beginning of the year, Carrier has announced new divestitures for joint ventures for about $200 million in annualized revenue, and that\u2019s in addition to the $1.7 billion previously completed.", "On the aero side, Pratt Whitney\u2019s engine continues to gain momentum in the market with the Bombardier C series order for 40 firm and 40 option aircraft from Republic Airways.  And Hamilton Sundstrand were recognized as Supplier of the Year by the Boeing company for its performance on the 787 program.", "Okay, as for the outlook for all of 2010, while there is still some uncertainty regarding the pace of global economic recovery, and foreign currency continues to be a forecasting challenge, we are very confident in our revised EPS guidance of $4.50 to $4.65 a share.", "As I said before, we continue to expect revenues of $54 billion to $55 billion, that\u2019s up 2% to 4% from last year.  And as I stated earlier, order trends are improving, and that\u2019s all in line with our expectations for organic growth to resume in the second half of the year.", "Our full year expectation for organic growth remains in the range of 0% to 2%.  No other changes to guidance for 2010.  Still expect $350 million of gross restructuring, partially offset by one-time gains of about $100 million.", "Our restructure in the first quarter was lower than we expected due to the timing of some of the projects.  We continue to expect gross restructuring charges of $200 million and about $25 million of one-time gains in the first half of the year.  So that\u2019s about $0.08 of net restructuring in the second quarter if I can do the math for you.  ", "E&D was down slightly in the first quarter, but we still expect the full year to be up about $150 million due primarily to [GTF] development and the acquisition of GE Security.  And of course we continue to expect free cash will be equal or be in excess of net income.", "On share repurchase our guidance remains at $1.5 billion for the full year.  And we\u2019re keeping our $3 billion placeholder for acquisitions for 2010 of which $2.1 billion was used in the first quarter.", "While the world feels much better than it did three months ago, keep in mind that it is still April and our guidance relies on organic growth in the back half of the year, particular in the high margin commercial aero after market.", "As always, we remain confident but cautious.  We also remain focused on what we control and we continue to position UTC to outperform.  By the end of this year we will have invested over $1.5 billion since the beginning of 2008 in restructuring to rationalize our cost structure.", "At the same time, we continue to focus on low-cost sources, and we\u2019re reshaping business unit portfolios to become simpler and more focused to deliver consistently higher returns.  And on the top line, we continue to invest in game changing technologies and to enhance our presence in growth markets and fuel sustainable top line growth in excess of global GDP growth.", "In closing we\u2019re confident in delivering our 2010 commitments, and the leadership team is committed to generating double digits earnings growth in 2011 and beyond.  Let me stop there, and Operator let\u2019s open it up for questions if we could.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", " ", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joe Nadol - JP Morgan.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Greg, just on organic growth company wide, you had said 2% to 3% down for Q1 and you came in -4 and my sense is that Q2 might me a little lower than you were thinking a couple months ago.", "Where are you seeing \u2013 is it in aerospace that you\u2019re seeing the weakness?  And what\u2019s your confidence level on that full year guidance which you didn\u2019t change?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think organic growth did come in a little bit lighter than what we expected.  I think there you know really three places that I would point to.  You know F&S was down organically about 8%, and that was a little bit lower than what we had expected.", "The orders have started to pick up there sequentially but still a pretty tough environment on the F&S side.  Also you saw you were down 9% organically at Pratt, that was a big number for us.  But of course that was really pretty much in line with expectations given the big back log that burned down in last year\u2019s first quarter.  And the other place I would say is probably Sikorsky came in a little bit light on the F&S side.  ", "Also you say you were down 9% organically at Pratt that was a big number for us but of course that was really pretty much in line with expectations given the big back-log that burned out in last year\u2019s first quarter. And the other place that I would say is probably Sikorsky came in a little bit light. They delivered only two more helicopters this year than last year and part of that is just the nature of the commercial business or we had a little problem with some of the customers where we didn\u2019t get some things delivered that we probably could have.  I expect again, second quarter will be a better story then first quarter.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay and then Pratt & Whitney Canada, spares you gave us the big Pratt but how did that you look in the quarter?", "Akhil Johri", "Buick was down in like mid to high teens level excluding FX.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "And how does that compare to what you saw late last year and what do you think is going to happen in the next couple of quarters there?", "Akhil Johri", "I think a little worse then we saw last year but we do believe fully because of the improvement of the traffic we are seeing in the customers\u2019 use of the business jet, that number should improve as it goes through the year.  So we do believe this quarter was probably the lowest compares that Pratt would see all of this year.", "Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, on the first question I asked on the organic growth, I just want to get back to that for one second.  The Fire and Security at negative 8%, where was the weakness organically because that\u2019s been a pretty stable business historically.  Was it fire or security and any details you can give?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, you know really we saw weakness around the globe particularly in the US, Austro-Asia.  I tell you the one bright spot in the quarter was Asia itself but for the rest of the markets it was really pretty much down across the board.", "Akhil Johri", "One of the things you would find, if I might add, is to it\u2019s not a huge, it was a little lower than we expected.  The orders in the third quarter last year for F&S were down 14%.  They were down 8% in the third and they are now down 3 in the first quarter.  So we have seen an improving trend and again, like Pratt, we do believe that the organic compares would start to get better for F&S as well going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ron Epstein - Bank of America.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America", "Good morning.  When we think about volume coming back through the business, how much of the cost take-out do you expect to be sticky?  I mean how much of it is going to go away when volume comes back to the business?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think the place over there that we have been talking about for the last year or so, is about two-thirds of the cost that we have been taking out are structural and should not come back when volume comes back.  A third of the costs are just related to the volume reductions that we\u2019ve seen so head count has been taken down sharply at Pratt & Whitney Canada.  Obviously it\u2019s come down sharply at Carrier with the volumes coming down.  The BL piece will come back.  But as far as the other cost savings, those things ought to stick.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America", "Okay then we\u2019re thinking that\u2019s what \u2013 $500 million or $600 million of cost to go, ballpark?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, that\u2019s probably a good ballpark.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America", "And then maybe one other question.  On the geared fan, if we were to see a re-engining announcement from Airbus or Boeing this year and it did involved geared turbo fan architecture engine, what kind of investment would you expect that would be in terms of R&D for Pratt?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well again, I think every time you look at a large commercial engine, you\u2019re talking about an investment somewhere in the neighborhood of a $1 billion but you\u2019ve got to keep in mind that that\u2019s over probably a 4 to 5 year period and there\u2019s lots of partners involved.  The clear preference of course is to offer GTF through the IAE joint venture.  Again, that takes a big burden of the E&D to the partners.  Even if we don\u2019t end up going through IAE, you can be assured that we will have lots of partners willing to sign up for that so at least half of the engine would probably be partnered out regardless.  So, again, all kind of manageable within the context of UTX.  ", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America", "You think it would be $150 million to $200 million a year, something like that?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, it could take, yes, $1 billion over five years is $200 million a year and you know half of that would be on our nickel so $100 million a year, rough numbers.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Greg, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on where the cash flow upside is coming from and specifically I\u2019m wondering, given the actions you\u2019ve taken at Carrier are you seeing, although you\u2019re in kind of your seasonal low ebb, are you seeing better cash performance there?", "Gregory Hayes", "If Carrier was probably I think the most pleasant surprise in the quarter.  Not just for margin expansion but also they had a positive free cash flow which considering it is their big inventory billed quarter.  It was a remarkable performance.  Carrier\u2019s inventory was up a couple hundred billion in the quarter but their returns were up over a point.  ", "So working capital I think last year was an outflow of about $700 million, this year only about $200 million.  So that\u2019s really where the strength came in.  If you parse that down and inventory was up in the quarter but not up as much as it probably otherwise would have been, so turns have actually improved across UTC working capital terms have improved. ", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "So I would bet that typically Carrier\u2019s negative cash flow in Q1 going back forever, do you think that\u2019s a permanent structural change in the business that you\u2019re going to, I mean it\u2019s going to be seasonally weighted still to the middle of the year but the working capital and other changes have inherently changed the cash flow of Carrier for the good?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well I think it certainly changed it for the good.  Obviously as we get out of distribution, we\u2019re not just sitting there with all that inventory that gets shipped from the factories into distribution.  We still have the receivables, however.  And Carrier\u2019s always going to be light cash first half of the year because of the big impact of the summer cooling.  But again, structurally having gotten rid of the or divested of a big piece to the distribution businesses so far, it\u2019s taking a big piece of working capital and put it on somebody else\u2019s balance sheet.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Now you did indicate that that raw mats were a favorable in the quarter and I\u2019m sure that that helped Carrier.  I just wonder how the channel is acting relative to price with potentially hearing negative footsteps on cost as we progress through the back half of the year?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think it was about a little less than, or about a penny I would say of headwind at Carrier in the quarter, so, I\u2019m sorry, tailwind, associated with raw materials.  Copper was lower this year than last year.  If copper has gone up, we\u2019ve seen around $3.60, I think when [inaudible] gave guidance last month we were talking about a $3 average price.  It\u2019s probably going to be more like $3.15 now.  ", "Pricing is obviously very difficult in the market.  Channel inventory is actually down we think year over year.  And I think it\u2019s going to be tough to push price in the back half of the year even with raw materials going up because there is so much excess capacity.  At the same time everybody else has essentially the same cost structure as we do in terms of inputs.  So given Carrier\u2019s scale, I think we\u2019re in a better position to take advantage of the market then many of the others.  ", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "And if you have the data, do you know how GE Security performed organically in the quarter if you look at it on a pro forma basis?", "Gregory Hayes", "I don\u2019t know that we have that data.  We can probably get that for you but I don\u2019t know that we have that handy here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs", "Hey Greg I wonder if we can talk about some of the pieces in Otis, the China orders very, very strong.  The profit forecast kind of buys to the upside but revenues are unchanged.  First question is sort of the way to put those pieces together just mix?  And secondly, can you address the question a lot of people are wondering about here in terms of a China property bubble.", "Gregory Hayes", "China property, let\u2019s get to that one last.  Because I don\u2019t have an answer for you.  I think the Otis story in the first quarter was really on the cost performance side.  New equipment was down 7% and even service was down slightly.  But overall really it was a great quarter because they took out a lot of cost.  They have 240 basis points of margin expansion, about 50 basis points of that just came from mix.  ", "I\u2019d also tell you though, they\u2019ve got a big piece of benefit from currency obviously.  That\u2019s actually going to be a headwind for them as they go throughout the year and we don\u2019t expect this kind of performance to continue throughout the year.  Obviously they\u2019ve had a big piece of their guidance here in the first quarter but for the full year we still expect new equipment down 5-10%.  ", "Service has to come back from the first quarter levels before going to be able to take their guidance up.  Now as far as China, orders were up just about 50% there but again, that\u2019s off of a very low compare.  Last year\u2019s first quarter was down 40%. So you do the math and we\u2019re still not back to where we were in the 2008 levels even thought the headline 50% sounds really, really good.  ", "Clearly the Chinese government is concerned about a property bubble.  We\u2019ve seen some of the actions they\u2019ve taken here in the last couple of weeks in terms of trying to limit the property sales and increasing down payments and such.  But quite frankly, we haven\u2019t been very much impacted by that.  Most of the growth we\u2019ve seen has come into the social housing and in some of the western provinces where the housing bubble isn\u2019t nearly as apparent as what we see out of the east side.  ", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, very helpful there.  And then on the confidence in the second half Pratt commercial spares improvement, you mentioned, referenced some of the macro factors out there that also all of us are seeing.  I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anything more on the micro level at this point or customer indications or anything along those lines that you can point to that reinforce your confidence on that?", "Gregory Hayes", "I\u2019d love to be able to point to inductions into the engine centers or customers telling us that they\u2019re going to be able to send a bunch of engines in, but quite frankly it really goes back to the macro view that as RPM\u2019s increase, and we saw them up double-digits here in February, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see engines come back.  Right now as we look at why are spares down so much at Pratt, it\u2019s truly because the overhaul continues to be these light overhauls instead of the regular heavy overhauls in the engine centers.", "So every spare part are down some 30% on some of these repairs of engines going through the shop. So again, we expect as traffic picks up, the airlines become more profitable during the course of the year we\u2019re going to see a return to more normal levels of repair activity and spare sales. Obviously this problem with the volcano in Iceland isn\u2019t helping matters and the industry probably lost a couple billion dollars of revenue. But, despite that I still think we\u2019re pretty confident we\u2019re going to see a lot of engines come back, we\u2019re going to have to see parts come back relatively robustly. ", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs", "Lastly, on M&A I\u2019m wondering still around $1 billion on the placeholder for this year\u2013 how you\u2019re thinking about public vs. private opportunities out there.  I guess if you look at the valuations in the public market moving up, does that shift your focus to the private side more or not necessarily? ", "Gregory Hayes", "Not necessarily. I think we remain open to deals, both public or private. Obviously as valuations pick up and it becomes more difficult to do a deal we like to buy for value. I think GE Securities is a great example of that. And as we sit here today, we don\u2019t see any big deals on the horizon, but we sat here at the end of the first quarter last year and we didn\u2019t know about GE Security either. You know deals happen when they happen and we continue to evaluate a lot of different things and we\u2019ll just have to see how they all develop. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities", "Good morning. Greg I just wanted to go back to one thing you just said so the engine shop visits right now as the works go unchanged, you\u2019re not seeing people moving back towards a normal work scope in terms of the shop visit?", "Gregory Hayes ", "That is exactly right. That\u2019s one of those things that I think as we think about what\u2019s going to change in the course of the year, the airlines again as they have more cash as they work these bigger repair bills, we\u2019re going to see this naturally pick up. ", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities", "This would be the time on Carrier, especially on the residential side, when you would be building inventory for the cooling season. Can you talk at all about what your production schedules look like now as in April and May vs. a year ago? ", "Gregory Hayes ", "As we start to look at the beginning of April orders are certainly trending up on the cooling side. We\u2019re running a full shift in Collierville, right now. We\u2019re not working the second shift. We didn\u2019t work any overtime last year. I tell you the production is ramping up in Collierville though. We expect really good growth for the cooling season here coming up. ", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities", "And then on F&S I guess the comment was February was the first positive organic growth in I think it was 18 months something of that sort. Did that continue into March and April or is the discussion about the organic growth being a little less a sign that perhaps it didn\u2019t continue?", "Akhil Johri", "I think the reference, Sam, was to the orders, organic orders were up in February. We saw the improvement in orders for the quarter. It was only down 3% compared with down 8% and down 14% in the prior 2 quarters. We still expect some negative organic quarters of 1 or 2 just given the lead time of the conversion of those orders, but we do expect that to turn around and be positive in the second half of the year. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Greg, you pointed out about the volcano so some of your eco-wash I\u2019m sure is up here. But you talked about working capital improvement, could you address a little bit why that\u2019s happened especially at Carrier. You talked about distribution but that\u2019s not really all of it. ", "Gregory Hayes", "Should we comment on eco-wash? Obviously it\u2019s the probably biggest growth opportunity we have right now is washing engines in Europe but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probably not across second quarter.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "I know that.", "Gregory Hayes ", "As far as working capital at Carrier, inventory was up a couple of hundred billion dollars but that is much less than we had seen in previous years. Again I think there\u2019s not a lot of inventory out in the channel right now, but Carrier has taken out so much structural cost and they have such a focus on cash, Cap Ex and the whole working capital area, I think that they\u2019ve really been able to turn the corner. Cash has been strong at Carrier really since the last half of last year going into the first quarter. And as you take the residential distribution business out it takes a lot of that cash capital out. We don\u2019t have to carry that inventory we previously did. ", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "You\u2019ve done a nice job with the numbers at Carrier in the aggregate.  Is there still some more trimming around the edges or are there still a few things you need to do to strengthen the franchise as you reposition it from here? ", "Gregory Hayes", "I think we\u2019ve announced a couple billion dollars in positions.  In California that\u2019s going to go into a joint venture shortly. We\u2019re still working on some of the other distribution here in the States. I think we\u2019ve got the northeast and Canada left. We\u2019re also probably looking at investing or joint venturing some of our other European and South American residential HVAC. So again, that\u2019s all part of this ongoing. We think we\u2019re going to get to $2.5 billion of net revenue divestitures so we\u2019re probably about 75% of the way there. ", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Just to follow up on one other thing. Research and development is obviously a function of projects and timing and other things.  Could you address where you are with the runoff on the 787 at Hamilton?  I mean the numbers really were a nice improvement year-over-year in terms of profitability.  ", "Gregory Hayes", "Hamilton did see a big improvement year-over-year.  In the 787 there were down about $15 million. Still a little higher than the run rate we expect for the year there.  That\u2019s not unusual in this space of the flight test program. For the full year we still expect about $100 million or so of spend in the 787 program. The first quarter was probably about 35% or so of that total. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Strauss \u2013 UBS.", "David Strauss - UBS ", "I apologize if this has been asked as I joined late. Greg, were there any changes to your underlying assumptions to Carrier for the year by market whether it be res, commercial, trust, trailer, container, any of the guidance points that you gave at the investor conference. ", "Gregory Hayes ", "Obviously the order rates are up wonderfully at Transicold, and probably a little stronger than we had anticipated. You think about truck trailer North America is up.  Truck Trailer Europe combined, those are up over 80% in orders in the quarter. We\u2019re very low base. On the commercial side, commercial HVAC, still down around the world ex-Asia, but again trend line is improving there. I think overall we just feel better about the year. For the year still only expecting about 2% organic revenue growth there. We haven\u2019t really forecasted a big increase. Orders are better, we feel a lot more confidence in the guidance, but a lot of that guidance is simply coming from the cost traction that we\u2019ve seen in the business.  ", "David Strauss - UBS ", "Nothing really changed in the underlying assumption by market. ", "Akhil Johri ", "It\u2019s probably a better conversation to have as the cooling season\u2026maybe we can have this again in a couple of months, may have better information. ", "David Strauss - UBS ", "Looking up to 2011 in terms of headwind, how should we think about in terms of quantifying F22 and D17 and then shuttle, can you give us an idea of what each of those headwinds might look like?", "Gregory Hayes", "I don\u2019t know if I can quantify the exact dollar amount. We know that production on the F22 is going to end after the first quarter of next year. C17 we think production will go down and we think there will be 8 aircraft with the DOT budget versus 16 this year. And obviously the space shuttle going away is impacting rocket time this year. So those are known headwinds. On the upside you\u2019re going to see a recovery at Pratt Canada next year and I think spares are going to come back relatively strong. The back half of this year and into next year to kind of offset a big piece of that headwind at Pratt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Could you give us some color on the sequential monthly trends in the commercial aftermarket at both Pratt and Hamilton Sunstrand?", "Akhil Johri ", "We typically guide\u2026 We don\u2019t talk about monthly data as such, but I think the point to make probably would be that there is improvement in Hamilton that we\u2019ve been seeing as evidenced in our overall quarterly numbers and it\u2019s not surprising given the broader base that they have across the aircrafts around the world, so Hamilton is the first one to see the improvement.  They also saw the improvement in the provisioning side which is also encouraging to see.  ", "On Pratt, I think that gets [back in mode] by the fleets that they are on and the [inaudible]. Also to remind you, Pratt\u2019s [inaudible] for first quarter last year was the strongest quarter of the year for last year.  So I think to talk about significant decline year-over-year, we still believe that it\u2019s due to tough compares and that should get easier as the year goes around in addition to the improving traffic and the phenomena that Greg talked about of maybe higher, heavier build schedules as the engines come back the later half of this year.", " ", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "I didn\u2019t really want specific, we were up 10% or whatever by month, but just any general color as you went through the quarter.  Was January the worst, did things get a little bit better in general?  Was it about level?  Any kind of color to that extent would be very helpful.", "Gregory Hayes", "We look at things on like a three month rolling average here.  Things are very lumpy day to day, week to week, and month to month.  January \u2013 really the whole quarter was just about on forecast where we had expected it to be.  There were no surprises either positively or negatively in the quarter on spare run rates at Pratt.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Also could you kind of walk us through [inaudible] Transicold, clearly truck trailer was strong, the orders were strong, when do you expect that to kind of translate into volume and kind of\u2026 Do you have any sequential color?  Are things really starting to pick up or\u2026 Was it even throughout the quarter?  Any color there would be greatly appreciated. ", "Akhil Johri ", "", "Bear in mind Cai that the order compares could be slightly different than revenues because orders in first quarter for last year, Transicold were down over 60% so [inaudible] up a lot while the revenues were not down as much.  So I think because of the backlog, sometimes you have slightly different compares on orders versus the revenues.  In terms of translating the orders regarding Q1, I think we should expect to see that at Carrier in the next three to six months. We still believe as we said in March that container and truck trailer should see somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% or so increase year-over-year.  That\u2019s what we expect the market to do.  One or two of the quarters might be different but that\u2019s what the full year outlook still remains.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Stallard - Macquarie Research.", "Rob Stallard - Macquarie Research", "Just a couple of quick ones on the aftermarket.  Greg, you did note that Hamilton Sundstrand saw the aero aftermarket up low single digit and the commercial spare orders up low double digit.  Does it imply a little bit of conservative about how the aftermarket is going to track this year at HS?  Are you confident that your supply chain is ready for this pickup in aftermarket demand through 2010?", "Gregory Hayes", "I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re accusing us of being conservative.  It was a good quarter.  In fact, I think it was a little bit of a positive surprise for us because for the year we had expected aftermarket to be up high single digits at Hamilton.  Obviously when orders are up in excess of that, that\u2019s always good news.  As far as the supply chain goes, we have not seen any real issue with supply chain.  Keep in mind, supply chain problems of 2 and 3 years ago were on record volumes and we\u2019ve come off of those and pretty much adjusted to that so right now I think we could clearly handle 10% or 15% increase in sales without any disruption to the supply chain or bumps from the supply chain.", "Rob Stallard - Macquarie Research", "Just quickly, did you get your normal price increases in the spare parts aftermarket in the start of the year?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, both Pratt and Hamilton published catalogs back in the first of October.  I think spare parts price increases were averaged around 5%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Doug Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Going back to the gear turbo fan, you refer to $1 billion of investment if Airbus or Boeing decided to re-engine with it and that\u2019s a typical cost for a new engine.  But what I\u2019m trying to understand, if you\u2019re already developing a similar thrust class engine for the MS21, doesn\u2019t that imply that you\u2019d be spending that money anyway and also, wouldn\u2019t that have implications for how you would structure investment in something like an IAE structure?", "Gregory Hayes", "You\u2019re exactly right.  Obviously if you build an engine for the A320 family which is going to be very similar to the MC21 that we\u2019re building, there\u2019s obviously big synergies on the core side.  You still have obviously specific testing that you have to do, certification testing and all that, but that $1 billion comes down materially if you\u2019re able to use the same core from plane to plane.", "Doug Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein", "I would expect you to be able to do that given what the aircraft looked like and if you go that way, you envision\u2026 let\u2019s say you sold it through IAE.  Wouldn\u2019t you envision having a much larger share in terms of revenues coming out of IAE given your investment and your intellectual property, you\u2019d be contributing.", "Gregory Hayes", "Those are all things that we\u2019re talking to the partners about today.  Obviously we very much want to do the Airbus re-enginging through the IAE joint venture.  Most of the partners are aligned with us.  One of them is not.  That\u2019s part of the problem, one of the reasons why this is more difficult than it otherwise would be to forecast for you guys.  ", "But we\u2019re working on every possible scenario with Airbus with IAE and with our partners.  I think if we can\u2019t come to conclusion with  Rolls Royce on this on how IAE goes forward, clearly Pratt\u2019s going to go it alone and I say go it alone, that means we\u2019ll still have partners, so to your point, we\u2019ll get a lot more than a third of the revenues in a geared turbo fan engine program than we see on the V-2500 today.", "Akhil Johri ", "As you well know, it\u2019s still all hypothetical discussion. There\u2019s still a lot to happen between now and before Airbus decides to re-engine and put GTF on, so better guidance, better direction as we always provide, we will give all this data to you once those decisions are made and be further along.", "Doug Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Then if I can quickly, decline in service revenues at Otis, typically Otis is something that service tends to improve year-over-year in good times and bad times.  Why do you think service is down and what\u2019s your thinking on that for the rest of the year?", "Gregory Hayes", "Service was down in the first quarter but just slightly.  You\u2019re talking about 1% or so and as you\u2019re looking at the three pieces of service, the biggest piece of the service revenue comes out of the contractual maintenance.  That\u2019s about two-thirds of the revenue.  That was actually up as it normally is. That just keeps growing every single year as the number of units under a service contract grow.", "What was down in the quarter was repair and modernization, and they\u2019re probably equal in terms of their weighting in the revenues.  Modernization was down the most though.  That\u2019s one of the things we think will come back strongly in the back half of the year.  There\u2019s still a requirement in Europe to modernize all of the older elevators so we expect as we typically do that repair and mod will pick up as the year goes on.  It\u2019s just a natural tendency.  Our guys are out there, they\u2019re selling this and building owners have to get things done by the end of the year.  So it\u2019s just kind of a\u2026 It was a bad first quarter but again, it doesn\u2019t really cause us concern for the year yet. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "A question on Otis as well.   On the new equipment orders, can you break those out in terms of geography?  Was largely all the strength from orders in China or was there strength elsewhere?", "Gregory Hayes", "As you think about it, North America was down about 30% on new equipment.  Like Akhil said, Europe was flat which is the second quarter in a row that\u2019s Europe has been flat.  In China we saw orders up nearly 50% so again, keep in mind, as we said before, that\u2019s off of a very easy compare when orders were down 40% last year, but the strength is really in Asia right now.  ", "Commercial construction continues to be a problem here in North America.  I think the only good news we saw today, I think ABI finally came out and its trending positively, still not at 50% level, but again we\u2019re going to have a tough year in new equipment in North America and it\u2019s probably not going to be great in Europe either, but that trend will reverse.  Again, one of the reasons we\u2019re confident next year is going to be  so much better is we\u2019re going to see a rebound at Otis new equipment next year.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Another question on M&A.  You answered it from one angle, but I wanted to take it from another which is we haven\u2019t seen strategic M&A in commercial aerospace from you guys since I think Hamilton Sundstrand in the late 90s.  Can you talk a little bit about sort of where you see opportunities in that arena and how you address kind of gaining share with Comac given their long-term ambitions in China.  Are we going to see more joint ventures out in Asia as a consequence of that?", "Gregory Hayes", "That would be just exactly right idea.  What you\u2019re going to see Comac is an important customer that both marketed in Pratt and Hamilton and had been working with the [Avec] companies for a number of years.  I think we view this, the Comac opportunity is unique and we\u2019ll be able to look at it from the Hamilton Sundstrand side to develop a joint ventures to supply the Comac aircraft within China and also to use those joint ventures as low cost sources for the rest of the products that we deliver.  That\u2019s the, I think that\u2019s the good news.", "As well on the engine although we did not win the initial competition on the engine, we\u2019re still talking to the Comac folks about potential for the GTS on the next generation or the next version of that aircraft so, lots of opportunity in China and commercial aviation.  And most of this is going to happen through joint venturing.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "But does this interest you in being larger in commercial air from an M&A standpoint.  I mean are there more things that you think you ought to be buying to expand this new entrant.  We have a duopoly market that some day over the decade is going to be an oligopoly and how are you positioning for that?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think as we look at commercial aero opportunities it\u2019s primarily the aftermarket space and you\u2019ve seen Pratt Whitney has been doing this for a number of years.  We just opened up the China Eastern joint venture to overhaul CFM engines.  We opened up the Turkish engine overhaul center again, the CFM overhaul shop and as we think about M&A opportunities it\u2019s really in the aftermarket area.  ", "There are three engine manufacturers out there, three big engine manufacturers out there.  It\u2019s kind of hard to do consolidation there.  Obviously there\u2019s opportunity on the Hamilton side from a systems perspective to go down the wire [spirter] to offer more systems, but some of the big aero sub system suppliers are very expensive.  I think our money is better spent and aftermarket where the margins are better and the opportunities are greater.", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  We\u2019ll take our next question from George Shapiro \u2013 Access 342", "George Shapiro \u2013 Access 342", "", "Hi Greg, if you go through Hamilton Sundstrand\u2019s aftermarket and break it up by the provisioning, the piece part and the maintenance so, is there much difference in any of those categories?", "Akhil Johri ", "The provisioning orders came back a little stronger as you would imagine because they had fallen off a lot in first quarter last year so then easier to base that these parts were up so, both were up in terms of orders provisioning probably a little more than these parts.  And then in terms of revenues I think it was about the same.  Provisioning was still a little down but these parts were up.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Access 342", "", "Okay and then, if you look at Carrier you got almost $100 million dollar increase in profit in the quarter so why weren\u2019t the 175 for the year be conservative and then if you can just comment on how much of that carrier profit if at all significant, came from the Watsco joint venture?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, first quarter of it was very strong, you\u2019re absolutely right there George, but if you take a look we did get a big benefit in the quarter in a very strong summer selling season down in South American in Brazil and in Argentina.  We also had tailwind from commodities that\u2019s not going to repeat.  It\u2019s actually going to be headwind in the back half of the year.  But to your point I think as look at the guidance for Carrier we are very confident that they\u2019re going to be at the top end and perhaps above that. ", "That based again on revenues but just on the very strong cost traction that we\u2019ve seen in the business.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Access 342", "Okay and then Greg, the Watsco, is there a significant number you get there from the way you accrue the joint venture profit in carrier?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, it\u2019s not a big number especially in the first quarter, George.  We\u2019ve got 40% of that joint venture so we\u2019re picking up a pro-rata share of the earnings but it\u2019s just not significant in the first quarter.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Access 342", "And let me sneak in on more Greg, almost $700 million increase in inventories.  You mention a couple of hundred was probably carrier.  Can you break out where the rest is from?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, to think about that, about $200 million of that came from the GE Security transaction.  And another $230 million or so was at Sikorsky and again that\u2019s just part of the issue that we talked about in terms of some of the commercial aircraft not getting shift in the quarter is going to go out here in the second quarter so\u2026 Most of the other units had very very small increases if at all.  ", "With that Patricia, let\u2019s conclude the call if we can.", "I want to thank everybody for dialing in and listening.  Real strong quarter obviously.  We\u2019re confident in the improved full year outlook so thanks for listening and the Akhil and team will be around to answer your questions throughout the day.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation.

Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory Hayes", "Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, a strong close to the year with 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. Solid margin expansion on the back of sustained cost traction and, of course, excellent cash flow. ", "Our short-cycle markets are recovering as expected. Emerging markets continue to gain traction, and we are finally starting to see a modest recovery in the commercial construction markets in the U.S. ", "We also continue to invest in new platforms and new markets that position us well for long-term growth. As always we remain focused on structural cost reduction, operational excellence and disciplined cash redeployment, nothing new here. ", "Just a reminder, as we go through the numbers today, we'll talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as we usually do. So if you look at the segment results, you'll see that UTC delivered exceptional segment operating margin expansion for the year of 100 basis points to a record 15.4% even as we increased investment in E&D by $188 million or 12% over 2009. Importantly, all six businesses expanded margins in 2010 and all six businesses achieved double-digit operating margins for the first time in UTC history, quite a milestone. ", "Otis led the way with an operating margin of 23%, Interior led the margin expansion story with 240 basis points of growth. The operating margin performance at Carrier, Fire & Security and Sikorsky put them all firmly on track to achieve their margin targets. ", "For the full year, sales were $54.3 billion. That's up 4% year-over-year. Earnings per share were $4.74, and that's up 15% versus 2009. Absent restructuring and one-time items of $0.29 in 2010 and $0.46 in 2009, earnings per share were up 10%. ", "Free cash flow, 115% of net income attributable to common shareowners. And we made over $1.5 billion of cash and stock contributions to our global pension plans. UTC's pension plans are in a good position. We're 92% funded on a PBO basis at year end and that's up from 87% in 2009, despite the fact that the discount rate has declined about 60 basis points. ", "Turning to Slide 2 now. Fourth quarter performance was solid across our businesses. Total segment operating profit grew 11% on organic sales growth of 6%. Pratt & Whitney and Carrier led the way with organic growth in the quarter of 12% and 9%, respectively. ", "Five of the six business units expanded operating margins in the quarter led by Carrier, Fire & Security and Sikorsky, each with over 100 basis points of margin expansion, evidence that our structural cost reduction efforts continue to pay off. ", "Debt restructuring and one-time items in the quarter were a headwind of $0.03. Restructuring charges in the quarter were $233 million or $0.17. Pratt & Whitney continued its push to reduce its footprint in high-cost locations and to reduce overhead in the face of increasing investment in new technologies and programs. Hamilton continued to work on its low-cost sourcing initiatives, and the commercial units remain focused on footprint and overhead reductions in both the domestic and international markets. ", "Significant one-time items in the quarter included a gain of $76 million or $0.08 a share from a tax benefit and net asset revaluation associated with the Clipper acquisition. Some good news from Clipper. ", "We also recorded a net tax benefit of $38 million or $0.04 from the repatriation of foreign earnings. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.31, that's up 14%. Excluding restructuring and one-time items on both 2010 and 2009's fourth quarter, earnings per share increased 9% on 6% higher sales. ", "Foreign currency was a tailwind with an impact of $0.02 from net hedging activity at Pratt Canada, more than offsetting unfavorable currency translation. Fourth quarter short-cycle shipments order rates were robust and consistent with our expectation for them. ", "Carrier's U.S. residential gas price and split unit shipments were up nearly 10%. In Aerospace, fourth quarter commercial spares orders at Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand were up 45% and 31%, respectively. ", "Otis new equipment orders grew 11% in the quarter, and Carrier's global Commercial HVAC new equipment orders were up 20%. Land markets are recovering in line with our expectations for 2011. ", "In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was 108% of net income at $1.3 billion, and this was after $600 million of cash contributions to our global pension plans. Solid cash flow resulted from strong working capital performance across the businesses. ", "Share repurchase in the quarter was $556 million bringing the year-to-date total to $2.2 billion. So again, no surprises, just as you heard from Louis in December, a strong finish to the year where we saw accelerating organic sales growth, excellent margin expansion and strong cash flows. ", "I'll come back and talk a little bit about 2011, but for now let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the segment results.", "Akhil Johri", "Thank you, Greg. Turning to Page 3. Otis delivered another solid quarter with operating margin expansion of 60 basis points to 22.6%. At constant currency, profits were up 3% despite a 1% decline in sales as benefits from higher service volume and ongoing cost reductions more than offset the impact of lower new equipment volume and pricing. New equipment sales were down 8% in the quarter, excluding currency. Trends remain the same as growth in China was offset by declines in North America and Europe. Higher service sales from continued growth in the contractual maintenance business and improved repair volume helped mitigate the new equipment decline. New equipment orders in the quarter, however, were up 11% led by China where orders grew 30%. Orders in North America were up 15% as a result of the order for the new World Trade Center transportation hub. Orders in Europe were down slightly. ", "As the global economic recovery continues, Otis expects to see ongoing strength in China and other emerging markets along with stabilization in construction markets in U.S. and Western Europe. For the full year, margins at Otis expanded by 120 basis points to a record 23%. At constant currency, operating profit was up 5% on a 2% drop in sales. ", "On Slide 4, Carrier posted another quarter of solid profit growth and strong margin expansion. Profits were up 24% on 3% higher sales, resulting in 130 basis points of margin expansion. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 9% on continued very strong results in Transicold plus good growth in all other major markets except HVAC Europe. ", "We saw nearly double-digit growth in shipments of U.S. residential systems, as Greg said. Organic sales for global Commercial HVAC equipment were down slightly, while order rates were up 20% at constant currency. Profit growth was driven by strong conversion on organic sales growth. And the Carrier would benefit from cost reduction and restructuring, partially mitigated by higher commodity costs.", "For the year, Carrier grew earnings by $276 million or 32% on 6% organic sales growth. Margin was 10%, up 240 basis points and on track for the target of 12% by 2012. ", "UTC Fire & Security delivered operating margin expansion of 130 basis points in the quarter on 18% higher sales. Organically, sales were flat with the product businesses up high-single digits, Asia up double digits and the other regional service and installation businesses down mid-single digits. ", "Net acquisitions, primarily GE Security, contributed approximately 20 points of sales growth. Fourth quarter orders grew organically 6%. Orders in Asia, as well as in the global fire product business increased more than 20% year-over-year. Backlog is up 14% organically from the beginning of the year. ", "Operating profit in the quarter grew 30%, driven mainly by acquisitions and the continuing benefits of productivity initiatives and restructuring. For the full year, operating margin at Fire & Security was 12.2%, up 120 basis points over prior year and on track to 15% by 2012.  ", "Now turning to Aerospace. On Slide 6, at Pratt & Whitney sales were up 12%, including three points from favorable currency conversion at Pratt & Whitney Canada. Higher overall aftermarket sales and engine volumes at Pratt Canada were partially offset by significantly lower industrial volumes at Power Systems. Large commercial engine spare parts were up over 40% in the quarter coming off the lows of 2009. Operating profit was up 14% in the quarter. The benefits from higher sales, favorable foreign currency at Pratt Canada and restructuring were partially offset by unfavorable engine mix, start-up and other costs at our non-legacy engine centers, as well as higher E&D. Operating margin for the quarter was up 40 basis points. For the full year, Pratt & Whitney operating profit increased 5% or $100 million, at the high end of the guidance range. ", "In the quarter, Hamilton Sundstrand sales and operating profit were both up 6%. Industrial and aerospace aftermarket sales were up low-teens, while Aero OEM sales were down low-single digits. ", "Inside the Aero OEM sales, commercial Aero OEM was up high-single digits but was more than offset by lower military and space volumes. Commercial spare sales were up nearly 25% and orders were up 31% versus last year with strong activity for both parts and provisioning. Book-to-bill was slightly above one. ", "Industrial orders increased 13% on a constant currency basis with particular strength in both the Sundyne and Sullair businesses, while Milton Roy was flat. Profit growth in the quarter reflects the benefit of higher volumes particularly of the high-margin commercial space and industrial businesses. This benefit was partially offset by substantially higher E&D. ", "For the full year, Hamilton delivered profit growth of 4% on 1% higher sales. Operating margin at 17.5% was up 50 basis points. ", "Turning to Sikorsky. Operating profits grew by 18% on 7% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 74 large helicopters, 58 aircraft based on military platforms and 16 commercial. Higher sales in the quarter were driven by increased international military aircraft shipments and higher aftermarket volumes, partially offset by lower U.S. government and commercial aircraft volumes. ", "Operating margin expanded 110 basis points in the quarter to 11.5% from lower manufacturing and overhead costs. Of note, during the quarter, Sikorsky announced that they would develop and fly two prototype light tactical helicopters, the S-97 Raider using the X2 Technology in advance of the U.S. Army's planned armed aerial scout program. ", "For the year, Sikorsky delivered 253 aircraft. Operating margin of 10.9% reflects a 110 basis point improvement from 2009 and is on track to the target of 14% by 2014.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for outlook.", "Gregory Hayes", "Thanks, Akhil. We're on Slide 9 on the webcast now. As you just heard, 2010 was a strong year at UTC. Organic sales growth resumed accompanied by exceptional margin expansion and as usual, solid cash flow. ", "In 2010, we returned $3.7 billion or about 75% of free cash flow to shareowners in the form of share repurchase and dividends. We continue to expand UTC's presence in emerging markets, which now represents just over 20% of UTC sales. The GE Security acquisition closed on March 1. The integration efforts by the F&S team were flawless. As a result, the acquisition was accretive in year one. ", "Carrier's transformation continues to yield strong results and exceptional margin performance. Pratt's reemergence in the commercial engine market gained more traction with the GTF selection on the Airbus A320 NEO, the fourth aircraft platform to adopt this new technology. Importantly, the first GTF engine has completed 150 hours of testing, confirming the fuel consumption, emission and noise improvements which were predicted. ", "Sikorsky achieved its goal of 250 knots on the X2 demonstrator program, while Hamilton continues to bolster its market-leading position with its selection by COMAC to supply five aircraft systems on the C919. Unless we forget our most profitable business, Otis, it expanded its industry-leading margins by over 100 basis points. ", "We also continue to aggressively restructure and drive efficiency throughout our operations. In fact, UTC's 2010 profit per employee, a key productivity measure, surpassed even the peak EPS year of 2008. This performance gives us confidence that UTC is well positioned for sustainable double-digit earnings growth into the future. ", "On to 2011. All the economic data over the past month and a half since our December 9 investor meeting seems to be generally in line with our expectation of a gradual recovery in our end markets. And so today, we're affirming the 2011 EPS guidance that Louis provided in December of $5.05 to $5.35 per share. That's earnings growth of 7% to 13% on sales of $56 billion to $57 billion. ", "We have seen a little bit of good news on pension expense since the meeting. You recall that we estimated a headwind of $0.17 for the year. As a result of slight improvements in asset returns and the discount rate, as well as an additional pension funding that we made in the fourth quarter, we now expect that headwind to be only about $0.13. On the other hand, we are seeing some pressure from commodities inflation and higher E&D as a result of the 787 delivery push out. ", "You've also heard us discuss the higher tax rate from the 2010 law changes. In addition to the higher rate for the year, these changes will cause variability in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. As an example, we expect the first quarter tax rate to be around 33% as most of the transactions impacting our tax rate won't occur until the second half of the year. For the full year, we still expect the effective tax rate to be about 30.5%, just a little bit lumpy during the course of the year. FX will also be a slight headwind in the first quarter. You\u2019ll recall that the euro averaged 1.39 in the first quarter last year. ", "In the business units, Sikorsky will have a challenging start to the year as it delivers its first Canadian Maritime Helicopters. On the other hand, we do expect to see continuing strength in Carrier's Transicold business, easier compares in commercial Aero and tailwind from lower net restructuring, so lots of moving parts. Bottom line is we're targeting double-digit earnings growth in each quarter, and we still expect quarterly EPS growth rates to be in line with our full year guidance. ", "On cash flow, we continue to expect free cash flow for the year to equal or exceed net income, and as Louis stated in December, share repurchase guidance is $2.5 billion for the year, that's up from $2.2 billion last year. And the acquisition placeholder is $1.5 billion. With our industry-leading franchises, seasoned management team and sustained structural cost reduction, we are well positioned for strong earnings growth in 2011 and beyond. ", "So with that, let's stop and open up the call for questions if we could. Michael?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Greg, could you elaborate a little bit around what you said on U.S. commercial activity? In particular, Akhil called out Otis being positive on the World Trade Center order. But if you kind of take that out, give us a little more color on what you're seeing in generally in Otis in North America and also in Carrier?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think the World Trade Center order was a big order. Absent that order, if you take really just kind of apples-to-apples year-over-year, it would be relatively flat I would say at Otis for North America. So awards still look to be promising for the year, but quite frankly, we're not expecting an improvement in commercial construction markets probably until late '11, early '12, and the ABI has been positive for the last couple of months. I think that's all trending in the right direction but that's a leading indicator. On the Carrier side, I think again we saw much better traction. We saw orders growth of about 14% in North America, which again really plays to the energy and efficiency theme a lot more than the commercial construction starts. So a little bit of a different story from Carrier to Otis. But generally, I wouldn't say we expect big, big recovery in commercial construction for the year.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And I think the comment was resi. There might have been orders but I thought it was shipments up 10% in the quarter. Can you give us some color on the attempts to position for price in that business as you kind of move into the season here in the middle of '11?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, we raised prices or we announced a price increase of between 2% and 6% late in the fall to take effect I think on February 1. We think, again the pricing, it\u2019s been followed by most of the competition so we expect these prices to stick. And it's not surprising, with copper at $4.40 or so there's lots of reason out there for people to be pushing price higher. Again, I think maybe the good news is we look at the resi business in the U.S., as inventories were still down in the fourth quarter. And even with the expiration of the $1,500 tax credit, we still saw momentum going into the end of the year. The tax credit is going to come down to $500 a system starting in 2011. So again, probably not going to play as big a role as we've seen in the last couple of years. But obviously, commodities are a problem. We can deal with that. That's all part of the guidance for the year.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "I was just wondering, Greg or Akhil, can you give us a little more color on just Otis aftermarket, kind of the contractual service versus modernization, any kind of distinction there in the trends?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think we saw continued good growth in the contractual maintenance. I think that was up about 5%, or 3%. Repair was actually up stronger, but modernization was relatively flat. And again, modernization is more of a U.S. and European story and we just didn't see much traction there. Coming up on 2011, though, we do expect to see a pretty robust growth back in modernization and repair as well as continued growth in the contractual maintenance.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Do you have an embedded pension tailwind for '12 now, based on where the line was snapped at the end of '10?", "Gregory Hayes", "No. I think again as we look at it, we're still amortizing some losses from 2008 and 2009. So there\u2019ll still be a little bit of headwind next year.", "Akhil Johri", "Jeff, it's only January 2011.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Joseph Nadol with JPMorgan.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "If you look at equipment orders in general, actually just orders across the business, Greg, the percentages looked terrific relative to last year but the comps are in different places a year ago, were in different places a year ago. I'm wondering if you guys could just provide some big picture color, not by geography but by business, where we are relative to where things were before the world fell apart? Where do we have a long way to recover still and where are we approaching kind of where things were before 2008?", "Gregory Hayes", "That's a great question, Joe, because I think there is some euphoria over the order rates that we've seen. But we should recall that we're still not anywhere near back to levels that we saw in 2008. If you look at commercial spares, they were up very strong at both Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton this past year but still well below 2008 levels. I think at Pratt spares are probably about $1.750 billion or so, down from about $2 billion in 2008. So you still got some room to recover on the commercial spare side, both Pratt and Hamilton. Transicold, another great story. Again, we saw a very strong orders growth at Transicold. I think orders overall, Transicold were up about 75% with very good strength in containers and also good strength in the truck trailer in Europe and the U.S. Again, still below the market, but I think the containers are still well below what we saw at the peak in 2008. I think if you go around the business, you'll see that really it's a consistent theme. Res? Again at Carrier it's the same kind of story. I mean very nice traction but a long, long way from our peak. And I think the peak in resi was back in 2005. So again, that all gives us lots of room to grow. As we've taken the cost out of the businesses, these revenues come back and orders come back, I think you're going to continue to see the margin expansion story play out as it has here in the back half of 2010.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Is there anywhere where your orders are now hitting new heights?", "Akhil Johri", "China, geographically, Joe. China certainly keeps surpassing its past records. India is doing very well. So emerging markets I would say broadly, the orders are up significantly versus the prior peaks. And then in terms of the other business units, I think probably still long way to go. Transicold probably is the one which is getting closer but still there is a gap, there\u2019s probably 30% to grow there as well.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "If you look at your eliminations in the quarter, x items, the way you define it, it was about $100 million and it's usually about a $50 million run rate. It bumps around a little bit but it kind of dampened the EPS impact year-on-year. In particular, segment EBIT was up 11%, again taking out the items, but consolidated was up only 8%. I'm wondering what was in there and how sustainable is that?", "Akhil Johri", "Couple of items. The Clipper charges, Clipper losses flow through that at this point, Joe. I think we've talked about the fact that for 2011 we expect between a penny to two penny a quarter on Clipper as we absorb that business into our fold. And then the second item is some legal costs, which were a little higher than we\u2019ve experienced in the past. It may not necessarily continue, maybe a quarter or two more, but beyond that, it should pale down.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So bottom line, we expect this number to be higher than it used to be but lower than it was in Q4 going forward?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think Q4 was a little bit of an anomaly just because we had some catch-up on these legal costs and of course it's the first time we saw Clipper in there. So we think it\u2019s maybe a penny or so a quarter is going forward here, over the last year run rate.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Any update on Clipper?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, I think the integration is going well. Dr. McQuade and team have done a nice job. It's a very good business in a very bad market. We've got good people. We've got good technology, but it's just a very bad market at this point but we're working on some good orders, and I think it's going to be a very successful acquisition over time, just not soon.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "A question on the price increase in HVAC. I mean, on the resi side there, I mean, we had this dynamic playout this year where people were sort of rejecting, replacing units for financial reasons. I mean if we put through a further price increase, which I understand you have to do given copper, but you put through a further price increase and the credit goes down, I mean do you think there's going to be any demand destruction impact from this? And are you seeing any change in kind of the fix versus replaced behavior? Obviously, it's off-season but just curious.", "Gregory Hayes", "I think we saw that issue last year where we saw, again people were not replacing, they were repairing, and so we saw a big mix shift where we typically had been selling whole new systems, we were only selling condensing units or only selling coils, whatever was broken. Again, as the economy recovers here, it's going to be helpful, but I think pricing is still going to be tough. I'd also point out that our price is a very small piece of the actual price to the end consumer. And as you think about it, on a system that might cost $2,500, ours is a relatively small percentage of that total cost to the end consumer, so this is not a 6% increase that the consumer is necessarily going to see. Although I'll tell you on the service and installations, and I'm sure they're experiencing the same type of cost inflation we are on fuel and other things and labor. So it's one of those tricky things where you've got to manage these price increases judiciously. Also, you\u2019ve got opportunities I think to continue to rein in cost increases as we look for product substitution. This whole issue of copper at $4.40, it gets to the point where it's going to be less expensive for us to put aluminum heat exchangers in than copper heat exchangers, and Carrier's actively working on that. Again, you can't keep pushing price. We realize that it is a demand-sensitive market, so it's a fine balance. I think Jerone [ph] and the team have been pretty judicious in these price increases.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "And on commercial aftermarket, I think the prior expectation was for it to be up low-teens in '11. Obviously, things are pretty strong, have you changed that assumption?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think with the strength we saw at Pratt in the fourth quarter with orders up over 40%, sales up over 30%, we've got a little ahead of ourselves in terms of expectations. We still think for the year, for 2011, we're going to see aftermarket at Pratt up kind of low-single digits as opposed to low-teens. Hamilton I think is still up kind of low-teens overall.", "Akhil Johri", "Double-digit. For spares, I think the only thing to keep in mind is while we still feel good in the orders for Pratt converted into sales in the fourth quarter except for spares, there is a little bit of hanging concern with airlines\u2019 profitability because of the oil prices. And if they continue to rise, then obviously it can turn around the airlines\u2019 profit situation very quickly and they could be back into a cash conservation mode. So while we still feel good about it, I think double-digit at Pratt and low-teens at Hamilton are still very good. That can change, as you guys well know.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "So it's more you making an assumption around the impact of airline profitability rather than something you actually have seen so far in the business?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, I think there's a lot of factors that go into the forecast. Obviously, the airlines made -- we think about $15 billion last year, that\u2019ll be less than $10 billion this year, again just as fuel prices move up. But we look at what we see in terms of shop visits for the year. We expect shop visits to be roughly flat on the legacy Pratt equipment. We see them going up relatively substantially on the non-Pratt or the CFM56 shops. So we got a pretty good view of what the aftermarket's going to do as we did last year. I think as Akhil has just pointed out, there's always been uncertainty where if oil were to spike above $100 a barrel, that's trouble for the airlines. We know that every dollar increase in a barrel of oil costs the airline something like $1.75 billion in profitability. So it's just a word of caution, certainly not what we're forecasting.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Greg, I guess I'll keep trying to dance around this question of, \"Hey, why did we get a little bit of pickup in the revenue guidance with these strong orders?\" And I guess the first part of that is did you really see the strength to this extent in December? Or is it, \"Hey, it's just early in the year and there are a lot of variables that can evolve so we're comfortable where we are now.\" How do you weigh all those pieces for us?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think we came in a little bit better than what we had anticipated. Clearly, on the spares side at Carrier, I think both Hamilton and Pratt surprised us a little bit on the top line. But I think Louis has been talking about this wall of spares for the last year. I think the wall is here and it looks like it's going to continue. But to your point, it's January 26, and it's really too early I think to take up the revenue guidance for the year. But we'll be back talking to you guys in another month or so in New York, and hopefully we'll see the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter continuing well into the first quarter here.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just to beat that copper horse again, I mean can you give us what that, at this point, what that year-over-year dollar increase on your copper cost is? Presumably, you're not -- you have everything priced at the leading edge here, so a lot of questions around how much inflation is too much inflation relative to what you can handle with productivity and a 2% to 6% price increase? Just help us with the sensitivity analysis there.", "Gregory Hayes", "Terry, actually it's something quite wonderful. In retrospect is they blocked in about 2/3 of their copper for the year. So even with the price today, let\u2019s call it $4.35, $4.40, I think the total price is going to be somewhere around $3.68 or $3.70, so we'd expect something like around $75 million of headwind from commodities at Carrier this year. I think it's $150 million across the business when you add in steel and everything else. So again, it was all part of the guidance. Might be a little bit more than what we anticipated but not significant from what Louis talked about in December.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "On the M&A pipeline, would you anticipate some activity in the first half of the year or tough to call on that? And then maybe just comment on where bid-ask spreads are at this point.", "Gregory Hayes", "The bid-ask spread still remains significantly apart, I\u2019ll tell you that. The pipeline is still pretty robust. First half versus second half, if I were to call it, probably more second half than first half just given the timing of how these deals roll out during the course of the year. But we're always out there. We're looking at deals. The key for us of course is you've got to continue to be disciplined, right? It's going to be in the core. It's going to be things that we know what we're buying, and we're not going to over pay. I think if you go back to the GE Security deal, we like that deal. It's a good sized deal, $1.8 billion. It was accretive in year one. It was absolute home run, great people, great products. If I could find five more of those, we\u2019d do them tomorrow.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Akhil, on Pratt & Whitney, you called out that the commercial spares on the large engines were up about 40%. I was wondering if you could give some detail on the other parts of the aftermarket in the quarter?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure, Rob. The Pratt Canada spares were up high-single digit and the Military spares were up over 20%. So I think overall pretty strong commercial aftermarket, overall aero aftermarket environment.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just to follow on from that and it related to Pratt, Hamilton and Sikorsky. What are your thoughts on the defense situation, I mean I don\u2019t suppose a hell of a lot has changed since December, but given the uncertainty on the budget, where do you see the most negative risk in the defense portfolio over the next 12 months?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think the next 12 months, I guess I don't see much risk because most of what we have for 2011 is pretty well in backlog today. Think about Sikorsky, we\u2019ll start there. They're in the process of negotiating Multi-Year 8. I think we're going to have that wrapped up in the back half of the year. That should add about 500 helicopters to backlog. On the Pratt side, I think it will be probably a little bit more problematic over the medium term. We know we're going to see a cutback in JSF production, probably lose about $2 billion of revenue on the JSF production starting I think in '13 or so, so figure about $500 million a year. Some of that is offset by the FTD program we'll probably ramp up to the tune of about $500 million, but still about $1.5 billion of revenue will come out, kind of 10%-ish margins. But I think the good news is we've got time to address that. We've seen plus ups over the last couple of years in spares. I think we just got an order for 30 F117s for the C-17 fleet, and Pratt continues to work that. JSF long term is going to be still a great, great program. And they continue to work, the engine\u2019s doing very well on test, not one of the issues that's really holding up the aircraft. Hamilton, again they've seen their military revenues coming down. We saw that here in the fourth quarter. Most of it on the military vehicle side. These are referring to the [inaudible] fire suppression systems in military vehicles. That business this year in 2011 will probably be down another $100 million, $125 million in revenue mostly as a result of just the cutback on the OEM side. So it's kind of a mixed bag. I think we're well positioned at Sikorsky. We're well positioned at Pratt in the long-term, and I think again the international military is going to pick up some of the slack for the U.S. Military. But again, it's not a great place to be in now. The budgets will be down.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Nigel Coe of Deutsche Bank.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG", "Greg, I just want to clarify the comment you made to Terry's question about M&A. Are you ruling out any new class of acquisitions in the near term?", "Gregory Hayes", "Nigel, I don't think we would rule anything out in the near term. But I would tell you is that the focus is on the core. It's about things that we know that we can add value. And I think that's the key. You're not going to see us go into healthcare. You're not going to see us go into things that really are way outside the core. In adjacency, where we think we can add value, where we can bring supply chain and operational discipline, maybe. But again, the focus here really is on those six businesses that make up the core of UTC.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then secondly, can you maybe talk about where we are on the GTF sharing? I think you mentioned some of your traditional partners could be looking to pick up some share of that engine. Can you maybe just talk maybe where you are in terms of negotiations and when you might have some clarity there?", "Gregory Hayes", "Nigel, we signed up a number of partners so far. I think MTU is probably the biggest partner that we\u2019ve signed up. Obviously, JAEC, the Japanese heavy industry consortium, is out there. It's part of the IAE consortium. We\u2019ve had discussions with them about joining us. And the target here is somewhere between 40% and 49% partner share. And we\u2019ve got lots of interest. The A320 NEO was a huge win for Pratt & Whitney, and it really has turned up the heat on the partners to sign up. So I'm not really concerned about getting to that 40% to 49%. It's trying to hold the line at that point I think is probably more problematic.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG", "On restructuring, came in at 233. I had roughly half of that modeled. I mean was that just a bad modeling assumption or did you really pick up activity in 4Q and maybe if you could just talk about the kind of payback you expect on that investment?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, there was more restructuring than what we had anticipated. We had some good news coming off of the tax line, as you saw. We had a couple of small gains at Carrier, so we took advantage of those to really go off and do some things. And the biggest thing, I think almost $100 million of it was spent at Pratt & Whitney, most of that on footprint reduction, trying to move out of some high-cost locations to lower-cost locations. And the payback on these factory closures is not the one-year kind of payback you typically see on the G&A or overhead reductions, but they\u2019re still out there in the three-year range or so. On the commercial side, again, most of it is on the overhead side, and most of those are still pretty good payback programs. Frankly, it amazes me that we're able to continue to find these very good payback programs out there. But the guys keep coming up with it. If we have the money, they're going to find ways to invest it that will have pretty good returns.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.", "Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Greg, you had mentioned about the tax rate variability throughout the year. Is there anything in terms of the restructuring or gains? Is there anything where it's, I guess, not covered during any of the quarters as we think about how they lay out?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, I think we've got this gains equal restructuring math that we're going to go back to, which of course, back in '09 we got off of. But as I look out at the quarters, I think we've got pretty well matched up or identified gains to cover the restructuring in each of the quarters. I don't expect that number's going to be very big either. We're talking about $150 million to $250 million of restructuring. So you might see $50 million of restructuring in the first quarter and $50 million of gains, but it will be pretty close.", "Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "And then with the 787 delays, have you changed the assumption with regards to Hamilton Sundstrand for initial provisioning spares? And then what does R&D look like year-over-year at Hamilton because of that?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, we\u2019ve changed the provisioning assumptions. We\u2019d always anticipated this thing was going to go into service in the first quarter, so now it's got pushed out to what we think is third quarter, some of those provisioning sales will move out. A&D will also go up a little bit, maybe $20 million to $25 million. So a little bit of pressure at Hamilton, but I think Alain and team have got it pretty well under control. We're not changing their guidance as a result of this. I think it's just one of those things that as you think about the contingency that we had, it might be a small call on contingency.", "Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "With regards to the A320 NEO, how should we be thinking about the timing as to when engine decisions get made? We've seen a couple of orders there. When do they actually decide which engine selection they'll use?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think you'll start to see engine selections probably by the second quarter, certainly by the Paris air show this year, I would expect some of the first in line are going to be signing up for their engine choice. And the key here, of course, is we have to retain the discipline of the pricing here. This is a great value to the customers. When you have an engine that gets 15% better fuel burn, 50% lower noise and emissions, there's value to the customer. We just have to make sure that we're going to get paid for that value as part of this. So again, we'll be disciplined. We've got a great product out there, and as we see, a lot of people want it. So I think it's a great time to be at Pratt & Whitney.", "Operator", "We will go next to Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "R&D, could you refresh my memory? What are we looking for now in 2011? And that number is up?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think it's about $175 million higher than 2010. I think 2010 ended up about $188 million higher. So it was a little bit lower than what we\u2019d expected but still up about $175 million this year.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And so maybe a little bit more than you had expected at Hamilton Sundstrand. In terms of your expectation of bringing on partners on the NEO, are you assuming that as those partners come in, they kind of have to pay tribute, as a price to play to get in since you've kind of absorbed some of the R&D that they haven't, so that that would soften the blow? Is that baked into the number?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, the tribute that you're referring to or the buy-in to the program is typically put on the balance sheet and amortized over the program. That actually doesn't reduce E&D. The reduction in E&D comes when they start taking on the work themselves as part of the program. So again, the $175 million that we're having, most of that\u2019s at Pratt. But that assumes the partners will be picking up 40% or so of their share of E&D during the course of the program.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And then you'd mentioned that Sikorsky initial margin pressure on the Canadian maritime program. Is that program still at breakeven? And is there any chance that could move into the red?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, the program was sold as 28 helicopters and then a 20-year service and support contract. And so when we look at the total contract, it is still very profitable over the 20-year time horizon. The problem, of course, is the initial helicopters are each going to go out with a $10 million check, and so that's what puts the margin pressure on these guys. You have $10 million, you're going to deliver six of them this year, probably two in the first quarter and then the rest over the remainder of the year. So just year-over-year, they've got $20 million of headwind that they didn't have last year. The program is still -- again, we think it's a very good program. The Canadians, they want these aircraft. We've done a lot to make sure that this is the best search and rescue helicopter out there. We think there's still possibilities for international sales, too. So this will be a good program over the long term, but it's going to be painful for Sikorsky as they deliver these first 28.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "There's been some talk by some other suppliers of a pickup in the bizjet market. Are you seeing any signs of that at Pratt Canada?", "Gregory Hayes", "We've seen a little bit of that benefit here in the fourth quarter. We started to see orders pick up just a little bit. But quite frankly, we don't expect to see it increase in bizjet delivery, significant increase until probably 2012 at the earliest. Typically, as you know, Cai, bizjet orders pick up about two years after corporate profitability picks up. We don't think anything\u2019s going to change in that model. There's still 15% of the fleet out there for sale, and prices are still relatively depressed for the used aircraft.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "As outsiders looking in on the GTF development program and now that you're on several airplanes, what can we use just as guides that things are going well or not? Can you kind of maybe throw out some things we should look for?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think it's just the achievement of the milestones. I think the biggest thing was getting first engine to test, which we did here in the fourth quarter, and it's completing those milestones. We're going to take the first engine to flight here probably in the second quarter. I think it's June, maybe July. We'll actually get the flight test with the CSeries engine up at Mirabel, at our new test center up there. I think it\u2019s just hitting those milestones. And we'll talk about those. And I'm sure Dave will hit on those in March as we go through the program. I mean this is a big program. It's big investments. We've got four platforms. But the technology is really very mature, and I think that's the key for us is mature technology. This is not a paper engine. We're going to actually deliver these things on time with the performance that we've guaranteed.", "Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Switching businesses, if we jump over to Fire & Security. When we all met down in Florida, one of the focus points was the growth of that business largely around kind of the new products that you've brought to market. Can you give us an update on what's going on there? How is the fire mist system doing and the online security stuff?", "Akhil Johri", "I think, Ron, some of the initiatives Bill talked about are doing extremely well. The Marioff business had very good orders in the quarter and continues to build its backlog. I think the one question which comes up is why is there a disconnect between the orders which have been growing strongly for the last several quarters\u2013\u2013we had 4%, 7% and now 6% growth in organic orders in the quarter, while sales has not grown as much. And I think that's because a lot of these orders are coming in long-cycle businesses. Marioff books orders but delivers in nine, 12 months. Similarly on some of the other fire suppression and firefighting businesses, we see a time lag between booking of orders and delivery. But we feel pretty good about the guidance for 2011 of mid-single digit type of organic growth for Fire & Security.", "Gregory Hayes", "And I would just add to that, I think as we look at the products side of the business, the products business is actually doing quite well, especially on fire products. We saw very strong order growth, good sales growth on the product side even in the fourth quarter. Where we've really struggled is on the service and installation side and that really is more endemic of the commercial construction overall market. And so as commercial construction remains weak in the U.S. and Europe, which is the biggest part of the Fire & Security business, that's why I think we're going to continue to struggle on service for a bit yet. But the product pipeline that Bill talked about, I think it's robust. I think all of those things are on track. And the GE Security products certainly help within the portfolio.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.", "Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research", "On Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton, I'd like to go back to the order growth because this was very high order growth. Can you talk about where you saw that both in terms of geography and in terms of legacy versus CFM56-type growth?", "Gregory Hayes", "Let's start with Hamilton, I guess. We saw, again, I think the pleasant surprise in the fourth quarter at Hamilton was the recovery in the provisioning market. Provisioning orders were up over 60%. Now that's coming off of a very easy compare in the fourth quarter of 2009. But we really saw strength across the entire globe in terms of provisioning orders, and that's not surprising. The airlines have been so cash constrained, they really needed to bring some of this equipment into their fleet. So provisioning was up, but parts were up nicely as well at Hamilton. And Hamilton's on every aircraft, every commercial aircraft out there. So their recovery has been pretty broad-based. Pratt on the other hand, they saw a very strong growth really under the legacy programs. I think the biggest growth in spares was out of PW4000. Also that we saw a good growth on the V2500 fleet as well, some of the PW2000. And the JT8s and JT9s are really pretty insignificant, but when you think about where those fleets are and those are mostly U.S. fleets for Pratt and some in Asia. So again, pretty good growth across the product lines.", "Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research", "But when you look forward, you were saying before that you thought you would see strong growth in the CFM56 side and relatively flat on the legacy products. Does that have an implication for some margin pressure with respect to aftermarket?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, that's a good point, Doug. I think as we look out in 2011 as we're ramping up these new CFM56 shops in both Shanghai and in Turkey, that's going to drive more spare parts volume into those shops. And of course, because those are CFM56 engines, we're not going to see the same margins on those parts as we do on our normal legacy parts, legacy engines going through the legacy engine centers. And that was really the whole thought there. Just to point out, revenues will probably pick up in the aftermarket nicely this year. But there may be a little margin pressure as the CFM56 shops pick up a bigger share.", "Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research", "On the two, when you look at restructuring in each of them, they each looked to have higher restructuring than I would have expected. You commented on the Pratt situation. What about Hamilton? Was there something additional there going on?", "Gregory Hayes", "Most of the Hamilton restructuring is around low-cost sourcing and just moving some facilities and some work over to Poland. Some of it\u2019s coming out of our APU business in San Diego, really just across the board, just trying to downsize and go to lower-cost manufacturing facilities.", "Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research", "But these are things that we shouldn't expect to see repeated necessarily in 2011?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, Hamilton\u2019s still got some work to do on low-cost sourcing. They\u2019ve got some trailing costs associated with these programs, and they\u2019ll continue, I think, and Alain will talk more about this in March but the big push in Hamilton is to look to move to low-cost sourcing. And that's going to involve more restructuring of some of our legacy factories as well as our legacy supply base.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Question on the NEO. It looks like that is attracting actually quite a lot of attention with the airlines, and the order pipeline looks pretty healthy. But I'm just wondering, should we assume that the GTF orders are going to come from the existing V2500 customers or do you possibly see any airlines converting their worst CFM56 users?", "Gregory Hayes", "I'm not sure that I'm going to hazard a guess in terms of which customers we\u2019ll ultimately select. But certainly, we\u2019ve got, I think, a very competitive offering to both the existing V2500 customers as well as the legacy CFM56. JetBlue is a great example. They see the value proposition of the GTF, and that we expect to have a very competitive offer to those guys.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Did you hazard a guess on the market share balance that you think you'll get versus GE on that?", "Gregory Hayes", "No.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Question on Fire & Security. Can you give us a sense on that GE Security business? You got a pretty good due diligence process, but nevertheless I'm wondering what your puts and takes were on, on what you expected versus what you saw? And what are the chief data points that we should look for in \u201911 to see how this integration\u2019s progressing?", "Akhil Johri", "The key data point, Heidi, is the fact that the acquisition was accretive in year one, which I think Louis mentioned in December and Greg confirmed today. That's certainly better than we had expected. The synergies are coming in nicely in both on the cost side -- actually on the sales side, the team has been positively surprised. As you know, we are very disciplined in determining the acquisition returns. We generally rely on cost synergies. And in this case, we have been pleasantly surprised with the sales synergies which are expected to come as well as GE Security brought in a good product pipeline and technology with it. So I think all in all, it's going very well and ahead of schedule.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "We\u2019ve touched on the MRO stuff before, Greg, but I wanted to dot the I\u2019s a little bit on that for a second. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing with the airlines? I mean for a while, they weren't willing to do much in the way of activity. Are you having conversations where you're getting a feeling like that could start to pick up more in 2011?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think as we look at the inductions into the engine setters this coming year, we're expecting significantly more, kind of mid-teens more, in terms of heavy overhauls versus the light overhauls. The phenomena we talked about in '09 was the fact that the engines were coming back as they needed to but they were having light overhauls instead of the normal heavy. So we're starting to see a trend now where airlines are getting the -- I won\u2019t say they\u2019re flush, because when they're making 2.5% margins, it's not exactly flush, but they've got cash, and they're investing that in their fleets to make sure they can stay flying. So I think we're going to see nice continued growth there just as the airlines continued to do some of the deferred maintenance that we didn't see done back in '09 and early '10.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "And then on Pratt & Whitney Canada, I didn't catch what you did in 2010 and what you think in 2011?", "Akhil Johri", "For Pratt Canada, Heidi, the engine shipments were up slightly. And I think fourth quarter was up 5%, so we've seen some improvement. And I think for next year we expect similar, about a 5% increase in engine shipments. But the full year \u2013 just to correct, for the full year the engine shipments were down, but fourth quarter they were up 5%.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell", "My first question was just on the trends you're seeing on the commercial construction and construction generally I guess within China. I mean you called out the very strong Otis growth, I can see that. But obviously the inflation concerns have only really become a very big deal I guess since sort of mid late November, and I just wondered if you'd seen any kind of slowdown in Otis or Carrier in China and what your sort of core expectation is for China growth in those businesses this year?", "Gregory Hayes", "Julian, I don't think inflation is a new phenomenon in China. We certainly, we've seen it over there and especially on the labor side for the last several years. Order growth was really strong across both Otis and Carrier. Both had order growth over 30% in the fourth quarter. Now that's going to slow down. We all recognize that. We're still forecasting though around 10% growth in orders in China in 2011. So the government\u2019s talking about slowing things down. Property continues to remain a very, very good investment for people. It's one of the few places where people can invest their money. So I think again slower growth. There\u2019ll be some cooling measures. We'll continue to see those from the Chinese government, but overall I think the demand for property and building construction is going to be relatively robust in 2011.", "Julian Mitchell", "In Sikorsky, I mean we're hearing sort of mixed things on commercial helicopters. I mean Bell were fairly positive this morning, but Eurocopter a couple of weeks ago were quite cautious. Can you just give an update of what you're seeing? I mean, is it kind of a lot of talks and discussions but not many placements or how do you see the market environment?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think we saw a relatively good fourth quarter. We\u2019ve had 17 orders. We had relatively good deliveries, although they were down versus last year. I think as the oil and gas market returns here in the U.S. and some of this deep sea exploration starts again and some of that uncertainty is lifted from the market we'll continue to see some traction on the commercial side. But it is a long cycle business. And I think 2011 is not going to be a growth year in commercial, it's really going to be 2012. And part of that\u2019s going to be driven by the introduction of the S-76D, which is the new model that I think we'll be starting to deliver in early 2012 at this point. So again, we're not forecasting a complete recovery in the commercial market this year. It's similar really to bizjet. It's probably a 2012 kind of phenomenon.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Deane Dray with Citi.", "Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc", "I had a couple of cleanup questions on Carrier and there was an expectation there might still be some pruning going on in some of those businesses. What's the timing and potential size?", "Gregory Hayes", "Deane, we've done about $2.5 billion of asset or business dispositions over the last couple of years. We still think there's maybe $500 million to $800 million to go. We still have a piece of the North American distribution here in the Northeast and in Canada we're working on. And I would say disposition, we're really talking about joint venturing obviously with some people there. But I think you'll see most of that probably play out during the course of the year. Not sure you'll see anything here in the first quarter, but certainly during the course of the year, I think Geraud will be pretty much wrapping up on that whole portfolio transformation.", "Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc", "And how about just clarity on the European HVAC. It was a bit soft. Was that timing or is there any austerity pressures there?", "Akhil Johri", "Deane, actually the orders in -- even though the sales were soft, as I said, they were down, but the orders in Europe were very strong. They were almost 20% higher than prior year for the Commercial HVAC business. So I think, while there are different markets, Europe, as you know, is a story of different countries. The southern countries still a little weak, but Germany continues to be strong and I think we feel relatively okay with the guidance, which is not very robust for next year. It's about flattish in Europe for next year for us.", "Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc", "Greg, I know you got asked a question about any potential new platform, but given current weather conditions, have you been looking at snowplows at all?", "Gregory Hayes", "Maybe we can convert some of those fire trucks that Fire & Security makes and put some plows on them, sell them in the Northeast. We'll see, but probably not much there. ", "Okay. Just let me close out and just say thank you all for listening. It was a very strong 2010. We're positioned well for earnings growth in 2011. And Louis and I, along with the business unit presidents, look forward to meeting with you at our analyst and investor meeting on March 10 in New York City. So thanks, everybody.

And it seems although the tabloids are all over this and it just doesn't seem to want to go away, as long as this is working sort of hand-in-hand with the authorities, it should over time go away, I would guess.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think the key is to work with the customers and to make sure this never happens again and to make sure that our systems are in place from a supplier quality standpoint that this kind of escape can never happen. But again, I think Otis is on top of this, and they're doing all the right things.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "Just back to the AMR thing again. So are the regular A320s, do you think an opportunity for IAE? Or as -- or are we talking about when you say there's still a competition, you're talking about those 130 neos and 300-and-some-odd options for neos?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, Joe, I think those are all up for grabs. The A320 family is the first they'll be in the American fleet, and I think IAE will have a good shot at that with the V2500. We're going to pursue that aggressively with our partners as well as the opportunity for the neo. There's no fleet commonality here issue that we have to worry about. So I think we've got a good shot with American. We'll put forth our best foot, and I think we've got a great engine. And we'll hopefully have a good opportunity here.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "Do we have a sense of when this will happen?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think it'll be sooner rather than later. I asked Louis that question this morning. I think he mentioned before the end of the summer, we would expect to have some type of decision on the engine selection.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "But not days or weeks? Not tomorrow, but yes.", "Gregory Hayes", "I would say again we're seeing mid-July, probably before the 1st of September.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "Okay, great, terrific.", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, let me just close out. Again, solid results in the quarter, continued momentum in order trends, all good news. We're confident in our improved outlook and in our ability to outperform peers. So I thank everybody for listening in the earnings call this morning. Akhil and team will be available for you throughout the remainder of the day. So thank you again and have a wonderful day.", "Operator", "Again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Akhil Johri, Vice President, Financial Planning and Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's home page at www.utc.com.", "The company reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory Hayes", "Okay, thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on the press release this morning, we had another solid quarter with organic sales growth of 6%, and that's after 9% organic growth in the first quarter. You'll recall that we actually saw the recovery in our sales group start in the second quarter of last year where we saw 4% organic growth. So with 5 consecutive quarters of organic growth under our belt, we're confident now in the sustainability of the recovery in our end markets, and we're confident in our full year forecast organic sales growth of 5%. ", "Earnings per share in the quarter, $1.45. That's up 21%. Continued focus on cost reduction and operating leverage from higher sales through a segment margin expansion even as we increased investments in engineering and development. It is no surprise that most of that E&D increase was at Pratt & Whitney as we continued to invest in the development of multiple Geared Turbofan platforms.", "We're clearly operating in a better economic environment than a year ago. However, most measures still point to a slow and uneven recovery. High unemployment, a weak housing sector and a deficit standoff in Washington all continue to dampen consumer sentiment here in the U.S. Our European sovereign debt worries still plague financial markets and constrain government spending in the EU. ", "On the other hand, emerging markets continue on their growth trajectories even with the adoption of cooling measures by the various governments to hold down inflation. And importantly, airlines continue to fill seats in spite of higher airfares.", "So with this uneven economic backdrop, we continue to see sales and order rates consistent with our full year expectations for most of our businesses. Carrier's Transicold business remains exceptionally strong, more than offsetting a softer U.S. residential HVAC market. This improved Carrier outlook, along with the translation-related benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar, gives us confidence to raise the sales and earnings outlook for 2011 one more time. We now expect sales of around $58 billion. That's up from $57 billion we've previously estimated, and now up nearly 7% from 2010. We also expect 2011 EPS to be in a range of $5.35 to $5.45. That's up from our previous guidance of $5.25 to $5.40. That's a range of 13% to 15% up over 2010. ", "The foreign exchange has clearly been a benefit so far this year, and the Euro has averaged $1.40 for the first half of the year as compared to our original assumption of $1.35. So now we're assuming that we're going to continue to see this year average of $1.40 for the balance of the year. This FX benefit and the improved Carrier outlook will more than offset additional engineering and development investments at Pratt & Whitney and a lower outlook at Fire & Security in our increased guidance.", "Before I start with the second quarter discussion, just a reminder that we'll talk to you -- talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring in onetime items just as we usually do. ", "Okay, turning to Slide 2, 2nd quarter results. You can see sales up 9% with 6 points organic revenue growth. More importantly, this is the first time in 3 years that all of our businesses reported year-over-year organic sales growth, reflecting a broad based improvement in our end markets. And we still have runway with most of our businesses well below peak levels, with the exception of Carrier's Transicold business and Hamilton Sundstrand's industrial businesses, both of which are now likely to be at or near their 2008 peaks. In the quarter, Carrier again led the way with 11% organic growth, while Otis' sales were up 3% organically. That's after 9 quarters of year-over-year decline at Otis. So a real turning point there.", "As I mentioned earlier, earnings per share in the second quarter were up 21%. Restructuring expenses were offset by onetime gains in the quarter compared to a net charge of $0.12 last year. Excluding restructuring and onetime items, second quarter EPS increased 10%, and foreign currency was a net benefit of $0.06 in the quarter. ", "Gross [ph] segment operating profit increased 10% even with $67 million of higher engineering and development investments. Segment operating margin was 15.9%. That expanded 20 basis points with 5 of our 6 businesses reporting higher margins. Carrier segment margins were up 110 basis points to 13.9%. Now with Carrier's operating margins now at 12.9% for the first half of the year, it's highly likely they'll be close to their 12% margin target for the year. And that's one full year ahead of schedule.", "Okay, maybe the one soft spot in the quarter. I think the one thing, of course, that my boss is not very happy about in the quarter, free cash flow is only 80% of net income, which is, of course, below our normal benchmark of 100%. Working capital increased by more than $600 million in the quarter due to higher shipments across the businesses and the timing of cash receipts. However, we point out for the year we're very confident that free cash flow will still equal or exceed net income. ", "Share repurchase was $750 million in the quarter, and year-to-date, we've invested $1.5 billion in share repurchase, a pace well ahead of our guidance of $2.5 billion for the year.", "Acquisition spend was light again. And year-to-date, we spent $184 million. Our Bill Brown and his team continue to work on a robust pipeline, and deals are hard to predict. As you've seen in the past, in the GE Security acquisition, we have the appetite and the capacity for large acquisitions, and we know how to integrate them well. That said, given that it's already July, we will likely spend less than the $1.5 billion placeholder on M&A this year and will likely spend slightly more than the $2.5 billion placeholder on share buyback.", "Okay, on Slide 3, orders. We continue to see strong order trends in the aerospace aftermarket with Pratt & Whitney large commercial spares up 23% and Hamilton commercial spare orders up 25%. At constant currency, Otis new equipment orders grew 15%, and Carrier's global Commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 9%. That's a positive sign for commercial construction. Emerging markets continue to do well with particular strength in the BRIC countries where combined orders for the commercial business units were up 26%. ", "So solid quarter, strong organic sales growth, earnings growth and margin expansion, all while continuing to make significant investments in these new technologies. I'll come back and talk a little bit more about the back half of 2011. But for now, let me turn over to Akhil to take you through the business unit results.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. Otis delivered a strong quarter with profits up 14% on sales growth of 12%. Operating margin expanded another 20 basis points to 23.4%. Foreign currency accounted for 10 points of profit growth and 8 points of sales growth. New equipment sales were up 8% in the quarter at constant currency, led by strong growth in China and Russia. Service sales were also up in the quarter with continued growth in contractual maintenance and repair. New equipment orders increased 15% at constant currency, led by China where orders were up close to 30%. Orders in North America were up mid-single digit, while orders in Europe were flattish. Pricing remained under pressure in most markets. ", "After including the translation benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar, we now expect full year profit at Otis to grow around $225 million as compared to the prior guidance of approximately $150 million. Sales are now expected to grow high single digit based on FX.", "On Slide 5, Carrier posted another very strong quarter with profits up $78 million or 20% on 10% higher sales. As Greg said, operating margin for the quarter was 13.9%, up 110 basis points from prior year. Organic sales growth was 11%, led by continued rebound of the Transicold refrigeration market. Transicold showed strength across all products and geographies with sales up organically more than 40%, led by the refrigerated container business. On the other hand, North America residential shipments moderated this quarter after a strong start to the year. While split system unit shipments were up mid-teens, this was offset by a double-digit decline in gas furnaces. ", "Earnings growth was driven by volume, strong conversion from continued productivity and cost reduction and about $15 million earnings improvement in our Japan joint venture from business transformation actions. The first half growth in Carrier's Transicold business was truly exceptional. We expect more normal growth rates in the balance of the year for Carrier. After a first half organic growth of 14%, we expect Carrier's organic sales to be up about 10% for the year. Given the strong first half performance, we are increasing Carrier's profit growth guidance for the year to about $325 million from $250 million-plus previously. ", "UTC Fire & Security delivered profit growth of 15% in the quarter on 8% higher sales. Organically, sales were up 4% with mid-single-digit growth in the products businesses. Among the service and install businesses, we saw high single-digit growth in Asia and Australia and high single-digit contraction in the U.K.", "Second quarter orders grew organically 5%. Backlog continues to expand and is up approximately 15% organically year-over-year and from the beginning of the year. ", "Operating profit in the quarter grew 8% at constant currency. Favorable litigation resolution contributed around $25 million of profit growth. Benefit from higher overall volumes was more than offset by substantial profit decline in the U.K. from lower sales and productivity. ", "For the full year, we now expect F&S operating profit to be up approximately $150 million instead of the prior guidance of $175 million as benefits from a weaker U.S. dollar and favorable onetime gains are likely to be more than offset by lower-than-expected organic growth for F&S as a whole and lower margins in the U.K. We continue to expect F&S sales to be up high single digit.", "Turning to aerospace on Slide 7. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 5%, driven primarily by higher overall aftermarket sales. Large commercial engine spares sales were in line with expectations and up more than 20% over the second quarter of 2010. Operating profit was down 7% in the quarter. The benefits from net higher sales and restructuring savings were more than offset by a nearly $70 million increase in E&D, unfavorable engine mix in both the large commercial and military businesses and higher pension costs. Operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, down 190 basis points year-over-year due to the impact of higher E&D and the unfavorable engine mix.", "As a result of higher E&D investments primarily from timing of programs, Pratt's operating profit is now likely to be down around $100 million for the year as compared with prior guidance of down $50 million. We also expect Pratt & Whitney sales to be up slightly for the year. ", "Hamilton Sundstrand delivered a solid quarter with 13% profit growth on 11% higher sales. Organic growth was 8 points, while foreign currency translation contributed 3 points. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by continuing strength in the industrial and aerospace aftermarket businesses. Commercial spares were up around 35%, while aero OEM sales were flattish as commercial aero growth was offset by declines in space and defense. Profit growth in the quarter reflects the benefit of net higher sales and slightly lower E&D, partially offset by higher program costs. Operating margin was up 40 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%. Commercial spares orders increased 25% versus last year with book-to-bill slightly below one. Industrial orders were up about 20% and remained particularly strong at Sullair. This quarter, we also saw an improvement in the longer cycle Sundyne business. For the full year, Hamilton Sundstrand remains on track to increase operating profit by about $100 million with mid-single-digit sales growth.", "Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 9. Operating profit increased 17% on 6% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 70 large aircraft, 2 more than the second quarter of 2010. 57 aircraft were based on military platforms and 13 commercial, including only one Canadian Maritime Helicopter. Higher sales in the quarter were driven by increased aftermarket volumes and higher commercial aircraft deliveries, partially offset by lower international and military aircraft deliveries. ", "Operating margin expanded 110 basis points in the quarter to 11.5%, primarily reflecting the benefits of higher aftermarket volumes, low-cost sourcing and slightly lower E&D. For the full year at Sikorsky, we continue to expect profit growth of approximately $100 million on sales growth of mid to high single digit. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.", "Gregory Hayes", "Okay, thanks, Akhil. We're on Slide 10 now for those of you following along. ", "A solid quarter. Continued momentum on organic sales growth puts us on track to deliver on improved sales and earnings outlook for the full year. I think that's the really good news here. It was also great to see Otis report organic growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008. And of course, it's heartening to see Carrier continuing to deliver on its operational and portfolio transformation agenda with a very strong quarter. ", "Also in the quarter, some big accomplishments. Otis won a contract to modernize and maintain the Empire State Building elevators as their biggest modernization contract in history. On the aero side, we achieved a major milestone on Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan. Pratt's first GTF engine for the CSeries aircraft successfully completed its first flight on June 20, and it validated the performance metrics that make it an industry leader on fuel burn, noise and emissions. ", "Hamilton Sundstrand is firmly on track to support the 787 entry into service, which we now expect to be in September. And Sikorsky's BLACK HAWK platform continues to drive international growth with significant wins this quarter in both Australia and Turkey.", "So with solid results year-to-date and the healthy order trends, we're confident in achieving the increased outlook of $5.35 to $5.45 for EPS on sales of around $58 billion. That's earnings growth, as I said before, of 13% to 15% on sales up nearly 7%. ", "This conversation wouldn't be complete if we didn't talk a little bit about some of the concerns. So let me tell you first of all that we're confident in our cost reduction efforts and our initiatives to drive growth. There are concerns out there. We all know what they are, and it's a sluggish recovery in the U.S., a weak consumer sentiment. There's continuing uncertainty in Europe. And we hear a lot about commodity inflation driven by emerging market demands as well as high oil prices, which are putting a damper on airline profits. We know about these things, but we're focused on doing things under -- focus on what we can control. And that's cost, and that's delivering value to customers. ", "We also talked about pressure on E&D as we continue to invest in these innovative new technologies, particularly as we ramp up multiple next-generation product platforms with Pratt & Whitney. For the full year, we now expect engineering and development to increase by at least $275 million. We also expect restructuring expenses of around $200 million for the year. And for the full year, consistent with our prior expectations, we see onetime gains will offset restructuring expense for the year. ", "Other couple of changes. Effective tax rate will be a little bit higher, we think, about 31% now for the year. That's up from the 30.5% we previously looked to or previously estimated. And we'll use that additional tax or the higher tax rate to repatriate some additional foreign cash later this year.", "As I mentioned before, free cash flow is slightly before 100 -- slightly below 100% of net income in the first half. We're still confident that free cash flow will equal or exceed net income for the full year. ", "We continue to expect solid conversion for organic sales growth for the balance of the year based on our relentless focus on costs and continuing to take advantage of operating leverage across our businesses. So overall, we're very confident in our improved 2011 outlook. ", "We've got a great seasoned management team that's focused on positioning the business for long-term growth with innovative products, a global market presence and flawless execution. Now let me stop there. Let's open up the call for some questions.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Greg, real strong performance out of Otis and Carrier in the quarter relative to our expectations. And I'm wondering on Otis if you can just talk about the step-up in profit forecast there given the pricing pressure comments that you made. It doesn't look like maybe the mix is as much of a headwind as you thought before. What are the dynamics at Otis that are going on? And then maybe you can address some of the press reports on the China issue there if there's anything to talk about there.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, first, I think in Otis, they had a very good quarter. Continued to grow earnings, continued to deliver on conversion. So even the operating profit or segment op margin, I think it was up 20 basis points for them. Obviously, they do benefit from the mix shift. Right now, about 60% of their business is service, about 40% new equipment. And we're going to see some pressure going forward, I would tell you, on that margin as new equipment starts to pick up. And we had a good quarter. I think 15% on a constant currency basis increase in orders. Very, very strong in China, up almost 30% in orders. So again, good growth there, good growth around the word. We saw good growth in Russia, in India, in Brazil. The U.S., Europe kind of a different story. Kind of flattish. The U.S. is a tougher compare because of the big order we had last year with the LAX airport. But I think good momentum across the new equipment business at Otis and, as always, a strong focus on cost control, which is why you're seeing these very, very strong margins. The second part of your question, I think everybody has heard there was an incident in the Beijing metro a week or so ago, a tragic accident where we had a -- one of our escalators fail. We're obviously working with the people in Beijing. We've identified the problem. It's a pretty small -- probably -- so think about escalator sales in Otis. It's really less than 10% of their total China revenue. This particular model is less than 200 of them in service. So we're out there, obviously, actively working to correct the problem. We've identified the root cause, and we've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. But no big financial impact, we think, to Otis. Obviously just a terrible accident.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then, Greg, just on Carrier's second half implied guidance. I mean, you're up almost $300 million in profit in the first half year-over-year. I think you had mentioned 6% organic assumption for the second half. Can you take us through the pieces within Carrier around that 6%? And then, it does look like the flow-through on the second half year-over-year revenue increase is kind of light. And is that caution? Is that copper prices moving up? Or what's driving that?", "Gregory Hayes", "Oh, Let me start, and I'm going to have Akhil fill you in with the details. The first half on an adjusted basis, we're up about $245 million. There's about another $80 million of back half earnings growth that we see. Again, we saw very strong organic growth in the first half of the year driven by Transicold. That's going to slow down beginning in the back half of the year. And so again, that's a high-margin business. We see good sales conversion on that. So you're going to see a little bit lower conversion in the back half of the year. But having said that, I think all of the businesses are hitting on all cylinders there. And slowest in the residential side but still, I think, good earnings momentum there, and it's going to be a good year. You just have to remember, the compares get tougher in the back half of the year not just for Carrier but on the commercial aero aside as well. And that's why again, a very strong first half. It will have a good back half but probably not the same big headlines that we saw here in the front.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, just a couple of data points to add what Greg said. I mean, first half organic growth for Carrier, nearly 50% of that came from Transicold, which, as you know, is the high-margin business. In the back half, that slows down a little bit because of tougher compares. Transicold had started recovering last year, as you will recall, and certainly in the fourth quarter. So you'll see probably 10% of Carrier's organic growth in the second half will be from Transicold. And what picks up is international residential, particularly Latin America, which is one of the lower margin businesses. So I think there's a little bit of impact from that base [ph]. And in reality, 23% conversion in the back half is not really something to feel bad about. I think it's a pretty good conversion still given that mix issue.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That's helpful.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Joe Nadol with JP Morgan.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just sticking with Carrier for our first question. Could you guys comment on whether Transicold was up or down sequentially from Q1? And then just a little bit of commentary maybe on the gas furnaces, which is something we pay a little bit less attention to maybe than the splits. What were the different demand dynamics there? And why was that down?", "Akhil Johri", "Transicold was slightly -- was flattish, although container, which is a big part of that business, was down in the second quarter compared to the first. Not surprising, Joe, because I think, as we talked about, first quarter container was very, very strong. And if that run rate had continued, the implied market for the year would be 60% above their prior peak, which was not going to hold. So I think that's the -- so we see the trends, which are not surprising at all. The truck trailer business picked up a little bit.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think, too, on gas furnaces, obviously we've seen the impact in the quarter of the elimination of stimulus during the year. Gas furnace was down. I think cooling was up in the quarter. So the net residential effect was about flat. I think the good news is Carrier's got a great new product they're introducing in the back half of the year. The new Aurora [ph] is a very high-efficiency furnace. We hope to actually use that to leverage sales growth in the fourth quarter and into next year. But again, it goes back to it's a slow economy out there on the consumer side. Housing still relatively anemic. But again, positioning ourselves, making investments today to grow on a long term.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then second question, just turning over to Pratt. You bumped up your E&D expectation. Is there -- and I know you have got a lot going on there. We understand, of course, why E&D is going up. But in terms of the incremental change in the quarter, are there areas you're struggling on with the GTF that you have to put more resources into? I didn't really see any acceleration of any schedules out there in terms of your platforms during the quarter. So just wondering what that is due to.", "Gregory Hayes", "Oh, I think what we saw in the quarter is the run rate on E&D picked up a little bit from the first quarter. And so that run rate that we saw in the second quarter we just recognized is going to continue on through the year. So I think in total, E&D at Pratt will be approaching $1 billion for the year. The key here is to get ahead of the curve here and to continue to make these investments to make sure that we're ahead of the schedule. Airbus, obviously, is anxious to get the engine out there. We've pulled that schedule up. We've said before about 6 months from our original expectations. But the key here is just making sure we get everything done ahead of schedule because if you get behind schedule, these programs get very expensive. And Pratt, as we said before, they have to execute flawlessly on these programs. And to the credit of the folks over at Pratt & Whitney, I think they're spending the resources, they're spending the money today. And they're getting the results, right? We validated the CSeries on the first flight. We met the fuel burn. We met noise, we met emissions. So everything is going along. But there's a lot on their plate.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Can you comment, Greg, more quantitatively in any way you see that if possible? Help us understand exactly how you're tracking relative to plan, not from a dollar standpoint but how many boxes are you checking on the program relative to where you should be.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, we just had our operating review with Pratt & Whitney last week. And it's a great question, Joe, because again, as you're spending all this money, the question is are you spending it as efficiently and as effectively as possible. So we have something called an earned value management system, which tracks the progress that you're making on a day-to-day basis with each dollar that you spend. And I think what was heartening for us is that Bob Sigh [ph], who heads the program, said they are right on track from an earned value standpoint from the cost. The dollars that we're spending so far have been as efficient as we had expected them to be. So it's not to say there's not going to be problems later on, but, I said so far, I think we're doing great job.", "Operator", "And we go next to Deane Dray with Citi Investment Research.", "Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc", "On Sikorsky, we're expecting 3, the Maritime deliveries. Does that change the outlook for deliveries for the second half?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, absolutely. I think for the full year, we're still at 6. So year-to-date, we've only gotten 2 out. So you'll see again some of the -- I think probably 3 push into Q3 and then most likely 1 into Q4.", "Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, and then over at Fire & Security, the softer operating profit outlook, you tied it to both, I think it was lower demand and also lower margins in the U.K . I was hoping you could expand on both of those.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, I think, Deane, as you know, the U.K. issue first, the government austerity there is hitting the F&S business significantly because, as you know, the U.K. is a pretty big portion of total F&S, and the government jobs were higher margin. And with them going away, there has been some kind of a negative pressure on the margins. They've also had challenges with some of their portfolio attrition rate, which has been decent, but the margins they're losing on some of those contracts is being replaced with lower margin contracts and that's hurting a little bit. And finally, I think the thing which Scott is focused on -- very much so -- is that costs were added a little ahead of the sales. There was a significant number of sales force additions in that country, and we haven't seen the sales to support that. So costs are a little ahead of schedule there. And with all that comes some pressure on margin. But Scott and team are on it, and it will be addressed.", "Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc", "So no change to the Fire & Security target margin for 2012? Plus 15%?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, I think what you're going to see, Deane, is the margins will be north of 13% this year. We'll get good margin expansion. Obviously, we're disappointed in the first half. But these are things that we can fix. Scott, Louis focused on this with the team. We're going to get these things behind us. And I think that 15% target is still out there. It's still something we're going to focus on achieving next year. I think it's -- we've got a roadmap to get there.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a quick question for you on the interest expense here running a little bit light in the first half relative to I think you're looking for flat year-over-year. Is that still the expectation? Or are you going to run at this run rate for the rest of the year?", "Akhil Johri", "Myles, I think the rate goes up a little bit in the back half because we do -- we are still planning to issue some debt in the third quarter. So I think what we see is probably $50 million reduction in interest expense for the year as compared with -- I think what we were really thinking would be flattish. So some good news there, yes.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then the F-22 sounds like it's being held in terms of deliveries at the OEM level from the oxygen distribution system. Is that affecting the military engine shipments as well? Are you continuing to ship those at pace?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, now for the F-22, we're in the process of shipping spare engines right now. In fact, the production engines, those are all gone. This is just we're finishing up this year and into next. I think by next April or May, we're done with the spares. And then that'll be it for Pratt in terms of F-22 SDF [ph] 119 engine.", "Operator", "And we'll go next with Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I just want to talk to you quickly about the announcement this morning out of American.", "Gregory Hayes", "Oh, yes, what's that?", "Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "But thinking about the GTF on the neos. It didn't go that way. I mean, were you surprised by that? I mean, how much of a campaign was it for you guys? How should we think about that?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, let's be clear. There's been no engine selection on the A320neo. I think the only news in terms of engine selections is the fact that Boeing has decided on an interim basis to re-engine the 737 with the leadbacks. But I think the engine competition is still out in front of us. In fact, I think it's -- this decision by American to go with Airbus to break up the Boeing monopoly that they've had on the fleet is really a testament to the success we've had on the GTF and what we've been able to do in terms of performance. I fully expect you're going to -- the A320 family of aircraft with the GTF power is going to outperform the 737 in the current configuration. The neo is still the best value out there. And we've got a real engine, we've met the performance criteria already and we're going to get there sooner than GE and CFMI. So I think it's actually good news for us in the fact that we've opened up the possibility of Airbus aircraft at AMR, and we think we've got a very good shot at putting our engine on those aircraft.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.", "Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Greg, can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the balance sheet and just the cash, which is one is, why were receivables up, I guess, $540 million or so in the quarter? Anything in particular driving that? And then secondly, to get to the $4 billion or so that you said between buyback and acquisition this year means you've got about $2.5 billion left to spend. If I look at where you are at the end of this quarter, you still got $5.4 billion or so in cash, certainly more than enough, and you're going to continue to generate cash. So what is the right cash balance we -- you should be targeting as we go through the year?", "Gregory Hayes", "To your point on the balance sheet, first of all, back to cash flow. Obviously, the growth in receivables, it's mostly at Carrier. Obviously, that's again part of the selling season. I think we missed the -- a little bit of -- a few cash receipts that we had been expecting. There was some timing on a couple of issues. But nothing really that gives us concern here. This is really just, I think, a week-to-week, a month-to-month time issue. So for the full year, we feel very confident about hitting the free cash flow and net income target. As far as the balance sheet goes, look, there's lots of firepower sitting there. We've got $5.4 billion of cash at the end of the quarter. Debt-to-cap is a little north of 32%. Right now, we're going to buy back stock because we don't see the right M&A target out there. But I would tell you that Louis, that Bill and the team are focused on doing some transactions. And eventually, we're going to get there. In the interim, we're going to use the cash, use the capital that we have to deploy it effectively, and that's right now share buyback, which, you look at the quarter, we picked up a couple of points of earnings, EPS, because of share buyback. We've taken 100 million shares out of the count in the last 6 years by share buyback, and it's still a very good accretive investment. But we want to do deals, and it's all about timing.", "Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "But you've said being north of $2.5 billion in buyback this year. I don't know if we should be using this Q2 run rate. But I guess what I'm trying to ask is you ended last year at over $4 billion in cash. I mean, it still seems like you're running with an awful lot of cash. And really, what should that balance be?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, obviously, we are running with a lot of cash. But again, we use that cash every day in our operations. So again, a big piece of that cash, probably north of $5 billion, is sitting overseas. So we use that to fund our overseas operations. So if you think about it, can you -- you probably don't have access to every single dollar out there, but we do put most of it to use every day through our inter-company lending program. And look, it's higher than we want it to be in terms of the cash balance because the M&A spend has been light. I think, again, you'll see us take up share buyback. Probably, it's in the third quarter, probably to the same pace that we saw in the first half of the year. Again, we just don't see a big call from M&A right now. But these things, they can change quickly. I'm reminded. Two years ago in June of 2008, GE Security wasn't on the horizon. And by the end of the year, we had inked a deal for $1.8 billion with GE. So these things can happen quickly.", "Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "So then one last question. Just in terms of your thoughts with regards to what was going on in Europe with Otis. In particular, a fine. I don't know exactly when it gets resolved. But how do you factor that and that likelihood into your outlook especially in 2011 for Otis?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, in fact, we just heard back from the first appellate court that we took the case to. And In fact, we did not get any relief from the fine that we originally paid I guess 4 years ago now of about EUR 300 million. So we hadn't been counting to get any money back. I think we still believe we have some opportunity there. We're probably going to appeal. There's a latest ruling, I think, to the European Court of Justice. But I'm not going to bake any of that in. I think those are things that if they happened, they're very nice and we'll use that kind of a onetime gain to invest some place else in the business. So we didn't count on it, and we're not going to count on getting anything back.", "Operator", "We'll go next with Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "Just another question on the whole AMR situation. Did you guys have -- were you in any way in discussions or have an opportunity to talk about GTF on the 37 (sic) \u00df re-engine? Or did that happen kind of totally outside your sphere of communication?", "Gregory Hayes", "Look, it's a small industry. Obviously, we've been working with Boeing. We've talked about this publicly in the past, about the opportunity to re-engine the existing 737. And I think, again, the problem we have with re-engining, we've made it pretty clear, is that they have an exclusive agreement with CFM. And until we have a new aircraft with the Boeing company for the 737, we're probably not going to have an opportunity. At the same time, I think the A320 is a great aircraft. It's going to compete very effectively against the 737, this re-engined 737.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "Can you give us a sense, Greg, on what we should expect for E&D trajectory into '12 and '13? And at what point does the line start to bend at Pratt?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, my crystal ball is a little cloudy. And I think we've said before E&D will probably peak at Pratt next year. I'm loathe to give any kind of guidance on 2012. I mean, we're -- there's a lot of things that will happen between now and December, when Louis stands up to give guidance. But I think, again, the thought here is E&D will peak next year, probably start to go down '13, '14.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "Then I was also just wondering on Carrier. A couple of prior questions that Akhil hit it in the open. But can you just be a little bit more specific, Akhil, on -- you gave us Transicold very specifically, but how commercial equipment performed in the quarter? Not the orders but the actual performance and the U.S. resi business?", "Akhil Johri", "Globally, Jeff, the Commercial HVAC equipment was up high single digits, and U.S. residential was slightly up just kind of very low single-digit type of level. I think geographically, U.S., Europe -- Asia was stronger than others, but the U.S. and Europe also grew for Commercial HVAC.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "And can you give us some color on price realization in HVAC, in particular in the U.S.?", "Akhil Johri", "I think as you know, Carrier announced a price increase in February. That has been doing pretty well. I think we also just recently last week announced a second price increase up to 6% on both residential and commercial products. That should go into effect over the next 75 days or so. So overall, still the net number for the year that we are expecting is still about $100 million negative for Carrier as the gross commodity costs are probably negative $200 million offset by about $100 million of price realization.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "And just finally, same thing on Otis. You mentioned price is still tough on new equipment. Any change, though, in kind of the level of pricing? Is it the same? Is it worse? Is it moderating? Are there any geographic differences that stand out?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think the market especially in the U.S. and Europe remains tough. Obviously, with the dearth of new commercial construction in both the U.S. and Europe, there's a lot -- not that much new work going on, so the bidding is tough. At the same time, we've recently raised prices in China on new equipment to compensate for the higher commodity costs, especially of some of these rare earth metals that we've seen. So that happened, I think, July 1 we've raised prices. So again, Carrier's got this $100 million kind of net commodity. I think Otis will probably have $60 million or so of net commodity headwind for the year assuming we get good price realization in the back half of the year.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "On the aerospace aftermarket, Greg, I don't see Hamilton Sundstrand had a very good quarter. I was wondering if you can give us some sort of clarity on what you think some of the underlying trends might be there, and whether they're sustainable even though you're coming up against tougher comps in the second half.", "Gregory Hayes", "I think, Rob, that we had a very good first half. And I would say it's a little bit ahead of our expectation. We talked at Hamilton for the full year kind of 10% to 12% growth in spares for the year, obviously a good start to the year. But to your point, compares get very difficult in the back half of the year, not just in Hamilton but it's Pratt as well. But I think the good news is that even with these high oil prices, airlines are still making money globally, and they're still spending money on maintenance and they're still filling up seats. So could -- I think could aftermarket be a little bit better than what we expected? I think so. Again, inventory, we know, is low out there both in the engine shops and in the repair shops. So I think there are still some opportunity for a little bit better aftermarket both at Pratt and in Hamilton than what we had originally expected.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "You're not expecting any sort of underlying trends to deteriorate in the second half? It's just a mathematical calculation?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, it's just simply math. If you think about spares at Pratt in the back half of the year, we're up 30%, and we're up for the first half, north of 30% now. So it's kind of tough to grow another 30% off of the 30% from last year. And again, oil is always out there as a concern to hold down or to dampen demand in the back half. Not that we're predicting a big slowdown. I think we're going to see a continuation of the run rates that we've seen in the first half in the back half of the year.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then secondly at Pratt, I was wondering if you could comment on how, say, business jets aftermarket spares have gone in the quarter and you're thinking of the future here. And similarly, on the aftermarket, have you seen some of these heavier maintenance checks coming through on the engines?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes to both. I think on the Pratt Canada side, the business jet spares overall were up sort of mid-teens, excluding FX. And it's consistent with what you are seeing on the takeoffs, and the regionals particularly have also been doing very well. So I think based on that, the Pratt spares, Canada spares were also in line with expectations. And to your second point, I think that the answer is yes.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.", "Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Going back to M&A, you've taken -- you've put Bill Brown in charge of the group. It seems like you're putting a lot of energy into that area. Yet we've had a placeholder that is small compared to history. And could you talk about what you're trying to do there? Should we expect the numbers for M&A or your placeholder for M&A to go up substantially in the future given an increased emphasis on the group?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think, Doug, you make a very valid point. The fact is, the $1.5 billion placeholder we've put in place for this year is before Louis put Bill in charge of the group. We're going to stay disciplined in the M&A side, but I think we have an appetite to do more. And while it's easy to buy back shares and not as easy to buy companies, we think we can create value out there with the M&A agenda. We've got 6 great global franchises, we've got opportunities around the road to do things. And just stay tuned. I think we've got more to come and probably a stepped up rate of M&A spend, too, during the next couple of years.", "Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay, so making this into a higher profile unit, which it seems like you've definitely done here, that is consistent with a much stronger focus going forward?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, I think -- and you're going to see us put our balance sheet to work, you're going to see us put more cash to work on the M&A side. And that's where I think a big piece of growth is going to come from over the next few years. It's going to come from the M&A. Again, commercial construction is going to be slow, residential slow in the U.S. But we've got a lot of cash and a lot of capabilities on the M&A side. I think that's what -- what Louis saw in putting Bill in that role is that we needed a bigger focus and a better focus, and I think Bill is doing exactly that. It just takes time.", "Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "And then on Fire & Security, the top line growth you had seems to be a little bit less than you expected. When you look forward and you're talking about this picking up in the back half of the year, but what should we expect longer term? Should we expect growth rates to move up more toward high single digits? And if so, what's going to drive that?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think, obviously, first half organic sales growth and even full year, we've taken the target down from 6% to about 4%. So a little disappointed in the rate of growth. And there's been a couple of issues geographically. Akhil talked about the U.K. I think what's important as you look at the backlog, it's up about 15% year-over-year. So this back half sales growth looks to be in backlog, and I think, again, we're getting momentum out there. But you've got to remember, a big piece of what Fire & Security does in the service and install business is directly related to commercial construction activity, right? And so to the extent that there's a dearth of commercial construction activity, you're also going to see kind of slowish growth here. So it will come back. I think commercial construction will come back. We've started to see signs of that at Otis. But it may take a little longer than what we have thought. But at least for the back half of the year, confident in the sales forecast based on the backlogs that we have.", "Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "But you're seeing the growth at Otis, and you're not yet seeing it here. Is that related to geography or longer lead times at Otis?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think it's really geography. If you think about where F&S is particularly strong, it's the U.K. and it's continental Europe. And those are -- and North America commercial construction. Those are the same places where Otis is not seeing big new equipment growth. In the quarter, Otis grew new equipment orders I think 15%. But Europe and the U.S. were not stellar in that regard if you back out Russia. So it's really the geography that F&S suffers from today. Australia is doing very well. Again, with the economy down, they're doing well. Commercial construction is picking up. And F&S is doing well in that geography. They're doing well in Asia. But unfortunately, the majority of their business is in Europe and North America. Those are the markets that continue to suffer.", "Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just a follow-up on couple of things. One is, you're usually very conservative in thinking about your financial planning. So this change in R&D at Pratt, does this mean that there's been additional opportunities? Or are there some other challenges that you've come across in the process?", "Gregory Hayes", "I don't think that there's other challenges. I mean, the real issue when we started out the year, the timing of the neo still looked to be entering the service probably 2016. Obviously, there's pressure from Airbus to move it up. We talked about maybe late 2015 now. And it's just the recognition that we have to get these programs underway. We're at peak spend right now on CSeries, and it's just you've got a lot of resources. And I think the Pratt guys are doing the right thing. They're spending more money sooner to try and make sure that we reduce the risks as we go forward in the development program. So that's why I think you're seeing this greater spend now. It would all give us a benefit, albeit maybe not next year but it'll -- soon or the year after.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "No, I get it. In other words, really way to think about it is you're not finding -- you're pushing the envelope on risk now and you're not finding anything?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, it's about risk mitigation today. And I think, again, with all the bench testing and all of the rig testing that they've done to -- we call it TRL, technology readiness level 6, we're there on all of our technologies. And spending on that is not cheap, but it's a lot cheaper than spending it when you're developing the engine and find a failure on a development test bed. So yes, I think they're doing the right thing. They're spending the money. And quite frankly, we can afford in the guidance here. So while -- we're taking it up a little bit. We're doing the right thing long term for the business by investing here.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then the second thing. Again, I'd say F&S probably has been, of all the businesses, the most challenging or the one that's not quite met your expectations. Is there a need to do some further reshaping of the way the business is focused to improve where you'd like to take it?", "Gregory Hayes", "I'll tell you, we've done 61 deals over the last 7 years to pull together the Fire & Security business. So we think we've got a very solid quarter of business both on the fire products, electronic security products and the service and install business. There's always opportunity, I think, to take a look at the portfolio that you've assembled, just like we've done at Carrier, and call out those that don't make a lot of sense, that don't have the same growth attributes that the rest of the business does. So Scott and team are focused on that. They're really working with Bill, I think, on that agenda. So there's opportunities both in M&A and, I would tell you, in disposition. And I think you'll hear a lot more about that as we go throughout the year and especially in December when Louis gets up and talks about next year.", "Akhil Johri", "And Howard, maybe it's a little bit of pride of authorship here for me, but, I mean, we've taken 4% ROA businesses and moved them to north of 12%. So that's not something we feel too badly about, I think, right? And there is opportunity to do more. But certainly, 15% next year will be a great target. And once we get there, there is room to do more.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Though I know we've had this discussion a bunch, I appreciate that, Akhil. And then just the last thing is the restructuring, frankly, is very modest relative to the size of the company and the various business units. I mean, what -- when you sort of look at what you're doing now today, Greg, in terms of the targets for improving performance, what are the sort of actions you're finding are most effective?", "Gregory Hayes", "Obviously, as we take out and consolidate back office functions, those things have the highest payback. And you talk about modest restructuring. I think we've done about $1.7 billion of restructuring here last couple of years. And although we're only doing $200 million this year, I would tell you that the businesses have identified well more than $200 million of potential things to do. So there's always an appetite to do more restructuring, to take out structural costs and to get more efficient. And the $200 million placeholder is that, that I think if gains come in higher than $200 million, you might see us take that up. The key is gains will lead to restructuring for the year. We've tried to maintain that discipline to go back to it for the last couple of years. We've spent in excess. But we've done enough. There's always more to do, but we always have our eye on what's going to make sense from a productivity standpoint in the long term.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Yes, first a tactical question. Given that we slipped some of these Canadian helicopters into the third quarter, maybe give us a little help on the pattern we should look for in Q3 and Q4?", "Akhil Johri", "Well, as Greg said, I think we're looking for somewhere in the 2 to 3 Canadian Maritime for the third quarter and then the remaining in the fourth. We're still looking at about 6 for the year. Did that help?", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Yes. I mean, just in terms of the earnings, should we therefore look for...", "Akhil Johri", "I think we -- look, as you know, Cai, we're not going to give quarterly guidance for Sikorsky. But I think overall, we still feel very good about their $100 million. Second quarter was a good $30 million increase year-over-year in earnings. And as we look ahead, aftermarket is going to grow even at a faster rate, and I think we get some additional benefits on the military side from cost reductions. So I think those 2 components will help offset incremental loss from the Canadian Maritime, and we still feel very good about being able to get the $100 million.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, Cai. I'd also add we've talked a lot about the Canadian Maritime and the financial impact or the losses associated with the deliveries. I think that's all well known. I think the key here is we're developing the world's most capable maritime helicopter, and we had great reception over the Paris Air Show from everybody, from the foreign governments that were looking at this thing. And like any developing program, there's going to be fits and starts and trouble delivering a couple of these early this year. Again, I think that'll all be behind us soon. We recognized in the forecast the fact that Sikorsky has got to deliver 6 of these this year. It's going to cost them, I don't know, $70 million, $75 million in earnings. And the base business at Sikorsky is doing phenomenally well. I think you back out these development helicopters, you'll see a business that's probably going to do 14%. But the fact of the matter is we've got to deliver these helicopters. They're going to cost a lot, but we're going to have a great, great aircraft when this is all done.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Terrific. And then I guess a bigger question, obviously, I guess, in one respect, good news that American is looking at the neo, and I guess you're in the hunt. Bad news, given that Boeing is deciding to re-engine the 737 and, therefore, pushing out the new single-aisle, which would have been the big opportunity for you, while it's not your call, do -- you obviously must be talking closely to Boeing, do you have any sense as to when the new single-aisle might happen given this turn of events?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think, obviously, to your point, we have been working closely with Boeing on the opportunity to re-engine. I think, again, it's -- the better outcome we always said for Boeing is a new airplane with the GTF engine on it. We just don't have the opportunity, as you know, contractually with Boeing to offer a re-engine on this -- on the current 737. When Boeing is going to launch a new aircraft? I think time will tell. I think to the extent that the A320 outperforms the 737 with our GTF engine, that just puts more and more pressure. And again, the GTF is out there today. We're flying that thing. We've got hours on it. We know it works. We're going to have a very, very competitive aircraft with the A320neo with this engine on it. And if anything, hopefully Boeing will move up its decision to build the new aircraft. But that's really a question for Mr. McNerney and Mr. Albaugh.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay, and our last one. Your military engine deliveries, 44, up from 30 in the first quarter. Where did the big uptick come? And I've been looking for that to be off 15% to 20%. Is that still the right range for the year?", "Akhil Johri", "Sorry, Cai. Repeat that again?", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "The military engine deliveries were 44 in the quarter, up from 30 in the first quarter. Where did the uptick come from? And is that in line with looking for those deliveries to be off 15% to 20% this year?", "Akhil Johri", "It is. I think it's -- the delivery increases came from all categories. I think the F-119s were a little up, F-117s were a little up and also your F100s. But I think it's all in line. First quarter was in line, but full year is in line with what we had said earlier.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell", "My first question, I guess, was on what you're seeing and what your expectations are for your construction-related businesses in China because I guess you've got very good order growth in Q2. Obviously, if we look at things like construction machinery orders and shipments in China, those have been down double digit year-on-year the last 2 or 3 months. So potentially, some -- that's a lead in some respects for some of your equipment going into building. So can you sort of clarify how you see that market over the next sort of 6 to 12 months?", "Gregory Hayes", "Julian, I think you've got to look at the various segments in which we participate in China. It's really on the building side as opposed to on the machinery and equipment side. And the biggest single driver for growth in China is going to be social housing. I think year-to-date, they've started about 5 million new social housing units. They expect to build about 10 million for the year and do that for the next 5 years, and I think that's driving growth. You also see at the provincial level still big investments in commercial real estate development. It may be slow on the east. But in the west, it's not that way. So again, people need a place to live. We continue to see this big trend in urbanization. We continue to see that as the driving macro force in China that's going to benefit our businesses. A little different than the machinery and equipment segment because these people need a place to live. Obviously, it's going to slow down. I think China, the growth rate that we saw in this quarter was 30% or nearly 30% at Otis and over 20% overall for our businesses is not sustainable. But I still think this is a country that's going to grow at least high single digits over the next few years, and we're going to get more than our fair share there.", "Operator", "Okay, we'll go to Joseph Campbell with Barclays Capital.", "Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital", "I wanted to go back to the Beijing escalator accident. The story continues to sort of stay in the Beijing newspapers, and I wondered if you could just talk a bit more about the extent to which this is -- is the investigation and the sort of pause of using Otis restricted just to Beijing and just to escalators? Or is it countrywide, Otis-wide? And yesterday or the day before, there were some comments about perhaps doing the same thing in Shanghai. And how you see this progressing to sort of restore the normal good relations that Otis has China-wide?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, again, it was a tragic accident, Joe. We're obviously working closely with the authorities in Beijing. So far, the suspension of Otis has been related to escalators and has been really related to the Beijing area. We haven't seen this spread countrywide. As I said, I think we ship about 6,800 escalators in China annually. Not a huge, huge market for us. And again, as we get to root cause working with the folks in Beijing, I think we'll quickly get to the point where people are comfortable that this was not a basic quality concern from an Otis standpoint. We think it's probably a sub-tier supplier that supplied some substandard parts. We're working through that. We'll figure it out. I think right now, there's again less than 200 of these escalator models out there. We inspected, I think, more than 20% as of yesterday. We'll get through those in the next couple of weeks. We'll get all these back in great working order, and we'll recover the lost business. But clearly, it's an unfortunate incident. These things happen. But the key is how we recover and how we respond to this. And I think the Otis folks in China have done a great job.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Fourth Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Maria Lee, [ph] Director Investor Relations.", "This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com.", "Please note the company will speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and onetime items as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] ", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thank you, Trinita, and good morning, everyone. As we all know, there's plenty of uncertainty out there in the world economy. On the one hand, of course, you hear about the ongoing European debt crisis, continuing weak U.S. housing market and the high unemployment in key developed markets. On the other hand, there are some positive signs that the economic recovery looks to be gaining traction, especially here in the U.S., and the commercial aerospace market continues to have good growth prospects. Here at UTC, we know how to operate in this uncertain and uneven global economic times and we continue to be well positioned to meet our commitments. ", "As you saw on the press release this morning, UTC closed out a strong 2011. Full year sales were over $58 billion, up 7% from 2010 and 6% organic growth, with all 6 of our businesses growing organically. Earnings per share were $5.49 and that's up 16% year-over-year. And free cash flow was very strong at 113% of net income, with 67% return to shareowners through dividends and share repurchase. And we achieved all of this while continuing to invest for the long term. Company-funded engineering and development spend was $2.1 billion last year. That's up $312 million versus 2010, primarily at Pratt & Whitney, as we continue to develop 4 separate geared turbofan platforms. As well, total restructuring was $336 million, of which $148 million was in the fourth quarter, as we preemptively positioned the company to grow earnings this year despite over $0.40 of anticipated headwind. That headwind is going to come from foreign exchange, pension and additional DND investments.", "Okay. On Slide 2, turning to fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.47, that was up 12%. A continued focus on cost reduction and productivity drove segment margin expansion, even as we increased E&D investment. Organic growth of 2% was slightly better than our expectation, and we once again had robust free cash flow.", "Full segment operating profit grew 2% on flat segment sales. Hamilton Sundstrand had another very strong quarter, with 11% sales growth and 12% operating profit growth on strength in both the aerospace and industrial businesses.", "Sikorsky's profit grew 2% in the quarter, approximately $35 million below expectations, primarily due to fewer-than-expected military shipments. Segment operating margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter with the benefits from cost reduction more than offset a $95 million increase in E&D. Restructuring and net onetime items were a benefit of $0.01 in the quarter, as restructuring charges of $0.11 were more than offset by net onetime items, which were a benefit of $0.12.", "The $0.11 of restructuring was spread across most of the business units. Sikorsky is taking proactive steps to position the business to grow operating profit despite a decline in military volume in 2012.", "Fire & Security continues to drive cost reductions and operations transformation to offset declining markets, particularly in the U.K., and to address continuing performance issues in their business.", "The $0.12 benefit from net onetime items included favorable tax settlements of $0.13, and a gain from Carrier's ongoing portfolio transformation of $0.09, which more than offset a $0.05 charge related to the impairment of the equity investment in Asia at Fire & Security, and a $0.05 reserve related to legal matters. These legal matters concern potential penalties that the State Department and the DOJ might impose as a result of self disclosures that we've made over the last several years concerning certain export compliance matters. ", "As I mentioned, earnings per share in the quarter were up 12%. Excluding restructuring and onetime items in the fourth quarter of both years, earnings per share increased 9%. FX did not have an impact in the quarter year-over-year.", "In the quarter, we also had a benefit from the operational tax rate of about $0.14, and that was partially offset by $0.04 of Goodrich deal costs and the $0.05 associated with minority joint ventures. Free cash flow in the quarter was 123% of net income. That's great performance. Even as we contributed $304 million in cash to our international pension plans. Even with the additional drop in discount rates this year, our global pension plans are 87% funded on a PBO basis. We spent $128 million on acquisitions in the quarter and there is no share repurchase. If you'll recall, we suspended share buyback in September as a result of the Goodrich transaction, after having already spent $2.2 billion in the year.", "All right, Slide 3, looking at orders for a second. Pratt & Whitney's large commercial engine spares were down 16% for the quarter, following a 45% growth in last year's fourth quarter. That's really in line with expectations. For the full year, Pratt's spares orders were up 8%. Hamilton Sundstrand commercial spares orders were up 17% in the quarter, after 31% in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, Hamilton's commercial spares orders were up 22%, very strong performance.", "So orders for Pratt and Hamilton were about in line with what we expected, while Carrier and Fire & Security were a little bit off. Carrier's North American residential HVAC orders were down about 20% in the quarter, roughly in line with the market. You'll recall that fourth quarter of 2010 grew about 30%, driven by the expiration of the tax stimulus rebate. But Carrier did see orders decelerate over the quarter to lower-than-expected levels. And we continue to see a preference in customers' buying pattern for lower-featured, lower-efficiency products. ", "Fire & Security orders were down 2% organically, driven by our own products and service and installation businesses. At Otis, new equipment orders were up 2% at constant currency, on tough comparison in North America and slower growth in China. Otis' new equipment orders in China grew 7% at constant currency in the fourth quarter, after growing 31% in the third quarter. For the full year, China's new equipment orders were up over 20%.", "We continue to see strong but moderating growth in the emerging markets, consistent with our expectations. Combined BRIC orders for the commercial businesses were up 8% this quarter, after growing 23% in the third quarter.", "So despite a slowing world economy, 2011 was still a strong year for UTC, with 6% organic sales growth, EPS up 16% and robust free cash flow. All while we continued to make investments in this game-changing technologies and cost reduction.", "I'll be back to talk about 2012, but first let me turn it over to Maria [ph], to take us through the details of the business units.", "Unknown Executive", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. Otis delivered another solid quarter with profit increasing 5% on 3% higher sales. Operating margin reached 23% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than prior year. The positive impact on operating profit from higher sales volume and continued cost reduction were partially offset by pricing and commodity headwinds. Favorable currency translation contributed 1 point of profit growth. New equipment sales increased 6% at constant currency, led by continued growth in emerging markets. Service sales were also up, with growth in contractual maintenance and repair. ", "At constant currency, new equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter with 7% growth in China, low single-digit growth in Europe and a decline in North America from last year's strong fourth quarter, which included the order for the World Trade Center transportation hub. Otis' new equipment backlog is up 8% year-over-year.", "For the full year, operating margin expanded 20 basis points to a record 23.2%, with 9% profit growth on 7% sales growth. At constant currency, profit increased 4% on 3% sales growth.", "On Slide 5. Carrier profits increased 10% on 9% lower sales, resulting in record Q4 margin of 9.8%, up 170 basis points from prior year. Organic sales were flat on continued moderation of growth in Transicold and the shutdown of our Toshiba Thailand factory due to the extensive flooding. The North American residential market is off to a slow start to the heating season and faces tough compares, as Greg mentioned. North American residential unit shipments of gas furnaces and split systems were both down double digit in the quarter.", "The earnings headwinds from lower North American residential volume combined with the absence of earnings from Latin America following the fourth quarter transaction with Midea, was more than offset by nonrecurring credits to warranty and benefits expenses. Commodity headwind in the quarter was completely offset by pricing, following the recent price increase in the U.S. ", "For the year, Carrier grew earnings by $315 million, or 28%, a 9% organic sales growth. With operating margin at 12.2%, up 220 basis points from prior year, Carrier has reached its 12% margin target, a full year ahead of expectation.", "UTC Fire & Security profit contracted 13% in the quarter on 2% lower sales. Organic sales were up 1%. Product businesses were up mid-single digit, and service and install businesses were down low-single digit due to continuing softness in the U.K. and America's businesses. Organic orders were down 2% year-over-year. Operating profit in the quarter contracted 13% at constant currency. Benefits from cost-reduction, as well as a gain on the sale of a guarding-related business in the U.K. were offset by continuing profit decline in the U.K. from lower sales and performance, combined with unfavorable sales mix. For the full year, operating profit was up $46 million and operating margin was 12.2%.", "Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 1% in the quarter, including 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency at Pratt Canada. Sales growth was driven by higher large commercial engine deliveries and industrial volume at Power Systems, partially offset by lower large commercial spares and reduced volume at Rocketdyne. As expected, large commercial spares were down 7% in the quarter on tough compares. ", "Operating profit in the quarter was down 2%. Higher E&D and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada more than offset a favorable adjustment of about $0.04 due to a contract termination. Restructuring savings offset higher pension costs. For the full year, sales were up 4% and operating profit was down $100 million, in line with guidance.", "Hamilton Sundstrand posted a strong quarter, with profit growth of 12% on 11% higher sales. Organic sales growth of 12% was the highest since Q2 2008. Sales growth was led by Aerospace OEM and Industrial businesses, both up about mid-teens. Commercial aftermarket was up mid-single digits versus a strong fourth quarter 2010.", "Profit growth in the quarter was driven by benefits of increased volume, partially offset by unfavorable mix from higher OEM sales. Operating margin was up 10 basis points year-over-year to 17.9%. Commercial spares orders increased 17% year-over-year with book-to-bill at 1.1. Industrial orders were up 16%, with particular strength at Sundyne's oil and gas business. For the full year, sales were up 10%, profit was up $115 million and operating margins expanded by 40 basis points to 17.9%. 2011 was a record year for sales, earnings and operating margin at Hamilton Sundstrand.", "Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 9. Operating profits grew 2% on 1% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 73 aircraft, 3 less than the fourth quarter 2010. 61 aircraft were based on military platforms and 12 commercial. On profit, strong aftermarket volumes and lower manufacturing costs more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower commercial aircraft deliveries and 2 Canadian maritime helicopters. ", "Of note during the quarter, Sikorsky signed a contract with the Brunei Ministry of Defense for 12 firm and 10 option S-70i aircraft, marking the largest order value to date for Sikorsky's International variant of the BLACK HAWK. For the year, Sikorsky delivered 274 aircraft. Operating profit of $820 million was up 12% on 10% higher sales. Operating profit was lower than expected, primarily due to lower military aircraft delivery.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay. Thanks, Maria [ph]. So a strong 2011, organic sales growth, record segment operating margin including double-digit margins at all 6 of our business units, EPS growth of 16% on top of robust cash generation. And we continue to expand UTC's presence in emerging markets, which now represents 21% of UTC sales. We also announced 2 transformational deals in 2011. First, of course, the acquisition of Goodrich, with complementary products and high aftermarket content, which will expand our presence in the fast growing Commercial Aerospace market. Integration and planning is going well, and there's no changes in our expectations for a midyear close of the deal.", "The agreement to purchase Rolls Royce's share of IAE joint venture and to partner with the next generation midsized aircraft, ensures a smooth transition from V2500 production to the GTF, and further validates the GTF technology. With the creation of the new Propulsion and Aerospace Systems organization, we'll better coordinate our technology development and take advantage of synergy opportunities across all of these businesses.", "Pratt & Whitney completed the first test program for the CSeries engine. Overall, 6 GTF engines have now completed more than 1,500 hours of testing and the engines continue to validate our performance expectations. Of course, our customers see the value in our engine and have ordered or taken options for more than 2,000 engines, and we continue to deliver production engines for the JSF. And during the year, we removed any doubt concerning the extra engine for the Joint Strike Fighter.", "Hamilton Sundstrand last year supported entry into service of the 787 with our 9 systems, all performing extremely well. And at Sikorsky, the BLACK HAWK continues to gain traction in the International marketplace with over 50 orders from international customers in 2011.", "We also announced last year the creation of the Climate, Controls and Security segment, and we'll begin reporting that segment in 2012. Geraud and his team are going to leverage their experience with Carrier's portfolio and operations transformation to drive continued productivity and margin expansion at the combined businesses. At Otis, operating margins of 23.2% were again a record, and we'll continue to lead the industry.", "The transformational deals, new organizational structure and continued investment in game-changing technologies and cost reduction, position us well for consistent long-term earnings growth.", "Okay. Let's take a look at 2012 for a second. There have been some puts and takes, but the overall economic data seems to be generally in line with our expectations that Louis laid out in December. And so today, we will reaffirm the 2012 EPS guidance of $5.80 to $6 per share for our base business excluding the Goodrich, the impact from Goodrich. That's earnings growth of 6% to 9% and sales of $59 billion to $60 billion. ", "Europe, of course, remains a question mark as we begin 2012, and we are seeing some pressure from the euro, which has traded as low as $1.26 versus the $1. We continue to keep a close eye on exchange rates and we expect FX to be a significant headwind in the first half of 2012, as the euro averaged $1.40 last year in the first half.", "And Louis pointed out, there's always volatility in interest rates and we continue to see that in the fourth quarter. We'd estimated that the discount rates for our pension plan would be about 5%. In fact, the actual discount rate came in a little lower, at 4.7%. The impact of that was partially offset by better performance in the plan, but unfortunately, represents an additional $50 million of headwind for 2012 versus the guidance that Louis gave in December.", "Also back in December, we had visibility of $150 million to $200 million of gains in 2012 that we planned to use to offset restructuring in our base business. We now see an additional $300 million of gains in the first half of the year 2012. We expect to use these additional gains to offset a portion of the Goodrich restructuring and deal costs, and this provides us some flexibility given the currency volatility and pension headwind. With the additional gains, we feel even better about 2012 than we did in December, although the first quarter will have its challenges. ", "As I mentioned earlier, we saw a slowdown in the order rates for the residential HVAC and the legacy F&S businesses. And that will put pressure on Climate, Controls & Security in the first half, which also faces tough compares. Carriers' operating profit, you'll recall, grew over 100% in the first quarter of 2011, driven by strength at Transicold and the restocking benefit of our residential HVAC business. We also saw a strength in our Toshiba businesses last year. But today, unfortunately, the Toshiba Thailand facility remains closed due to clean-up efforts related to the extensive flooding.", "On the Aerospace side, order rates were in line with expectations in the fourth quarter, but they also faced tough compares in the first quarter. As you recall, commercial spares sales were up over 30% at Pratt last year and up over 20% at Hamilton in the first quarter of 2011. So a little bit of first quarter headwind and a little bit in half, we'll have to deal with it.", "Turning to cash flow for 2012. We continue to expect free cash flow to equal or exceed net income for the full year. We have suspended our share repurchase program and we have a placeholder for acquisitions of $500 million for the year, excluding Goodrich and the IAE transaction.", "With our industry-leading franchises, transformational deals and sustained structural cost reduction, we are well positioned for earnings growth in 2012 and beyond. ", "So with that, let's open up the call for questions. Trinita?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Our first question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Two items, Greg. First, you talk about $300 million in gains, and I think some of that comes from some asset sales that you've already announced. Could you highlight those? I think one of them is the Ecowash business and then there's another Carrier-related sale, I believe?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No. We had identified $150 million to $200 million of gains to offset restructuring, and Louis talked about that in December. And I think those things that you're talking about were those gains that we have contemplated. This is an additional $300 million of gains and it's really related to settlement of some open tax years that we expect to happen here in the first half of the year. So this is truly incremental to what Louis had talked about. So we have seen $150 million to $200 million of gains, we now see roughly $500 million of gains.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then just one item. Everybody dealing with Uncle Sam and the Department of Defense is facing challenges, and one of the uncertainties that you've had has been with the multiyear procurement of the U-860. How do you sort of see that playing out? And what sort of puts and takes have you sort of allowed for, with respect to that issue?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. Howard, it's a very good question. I think we have pretty well calibrated Sikorsky military for 2012, given what we expect to come out in the budget tomorrow. BLACK HAWKs will be down about 30 units, about 15% in sales at Sikorsky on the military side. So I think, we've already contemplated that as part of a multiyear 8. We're still negotiating multiyear, where we expect to have that done kind of midyear. I would point out on the military side though, it's not all gloom and doom. You do have good news on the Pratt side with the JSF. As I said, there's no extra engine. As we see it right now, we see about 10% growth in the military side of Pratt in 2012 on the back of the JSF production. So I think it's actually pretty good news.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And I guess C-17 is doing well, given the ongoing demand in Afghanistan.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. C-17, I think, so the aftermarket plays well as an OE, it continues -- we've got the C-17s going to India. And again, good, strong aftermarket there.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sort of jumping between calls here, so I apologize if you got into this. And if you did, I'll just come back. But I wonder, if you can touch base on Otis aftermarket. Growth was pretty anemic there. Can you update us on your thinking on China as well, with regards to the social housing dynamic over the next 12 months or so?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. If we take a look at service at Otis in the fourth quarter, it was only up about 1%. Really, a pretty decent on the maintenance side. Where we really saw softness was in modernization. That was actually down about 4% or so. Repair was up 4%. And, I think, regular maintenance was up 2 or so percent. So a little softer than what we had expected, but really on the modernization side. Europe continues to be the drag there, where we're just not getting traction on the mod  orders that we had expected. At China, it's a little different story. Obviously, there was a slowdown, where we saw our growth going from 30% to 7% on the OE. But as we think about this, we really got very strong backlog going into 2012, up about 20% year-over-year. And we think again, we'll see mid-single-digit growth at Otis this year, driven by social housing. And again, the move from the Eastern Seaboard to the West of the country. I think social housing last year was about 5 million units. The government came out recently and revised the projection from 10 million down to 7 million units this year, but still pretty strong growth. And again, we don't really have a big concern about China slowing down dramatically this year. I think, again, the fourth quarter was probably to be expected, given what the government was doing to try and rein in the property speculation in China. But 7% growth is still pretty good and for the year, 20% growth in Otis in new equipment in China. So I don't think that story really changes fundamentally.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then with regards to the first quarter comps that you talked about at Carrier. Does Carrier overall have negative organic growth in the first quarter or not that bad?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, no. It's not that bad. I think the issue that you have at Carrier is, last year, first quarter earnings, I think, were up $167 million. That's up over 100% year-over-year. And thus, you had F&S which grew, I think, at 36 or so. It was over $200 million between the combined businesses. And F&S also had the gain on the sale of its U.K. manned guarding business. So it's is a pretty tough comp. We will see Transicold down in the first quarter. We expect res to come back a little bit. We expect commercial to be okay. But I think, again, just with the pressures of Toshiba Thailand and the fact that we're not shipping anything there, earnings are going to be challenged. In fact, I would think in the first quarter, earnings will be down at CCS year-over-year. First half, we'll probably be flat and then for the rest of the year, we'll see the growth as we get traction on the restructuring and the continued market improvements throughout the year.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Greg, just lastly, some chatter out there about how you might be thinking about asset sales to help to fund Goodrich and some chatter about strategic considerations on Sikorsky. And related to that, I guess, joint ventures and so forth. Can you just address that whole issue as well?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Let me take it head-on because I think there's -- Louis said this back in December. And I think obviously as part of the Goodrich deal, we had hoped to issue about $4 billion of equity and $12 billion of debt. And we all know we hate to issue equity. At the same time, I hate to lose my credit rating. So we're going to go after this in a methodical fashion. We're looking at non-core assets to divest and we're going to continue down that path. We're going to work with the rating agencies over the next couple of months and come up with a plan that will hopefully reduce the amount of equity that we're going to issue, and we're going to lay that out for investors in our March 15 meeting down in New York. So we're continuing to work it. We're looking at non-core assets across UTC both on the commercial side and on the aero side. Let me just say that Sikorsky, as far as I can tell, is a core asset of UTC though. So I think we can probably put that speculation to bed.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Just a little on Fire & Security, Greg. I mean, what you said about Q1 is fairly clear. But just thinking about moving beyond that, a number of issues there. I think some of what you're dealing with maybe some stuff in backlog that you're not particularly proud of and need to work its way through. I just wonder if you can give us some thoughts on that. How long that drag persists? And how long it takes to kind of get after the SG&A that's also causing the cost headwinds relative to growth maybe being on the light side versus expectations?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, yes, Jeff, those are all good and fair questions. I would tell you, while we're disappointed with F&S's performance last year, I have to point out that we still had 12.2% margins. So it's not a broken business. But there certainly are opportunities for improvement. And I would tell you, first and foremost, it's in the field operations in Europe and primarily in the U.K. As we dissected this and Geraud and the team have been looking at the portfolio there, certainly, we were taking out some work at margins that were really just not acceptable and the performance on those contracts weren't very good. I think we cleaned a lot of that up in the fourth quarter. But it's probably going to be a tough 2012 at F&S, as we work our way through the rest of that portfolio. As Geraud is taking a look at the entire portfolio, he would expect to divest, I think, some of the non-core F&S assets this year. And I think you'll hear more about that in March. But fundamentally, the business is not broken. We have some opportunities. We know how to fix things. We go back to Collierville at Carrier back in 2006. That was a broken factory after the SEER 13 transition. I think, we made no bones about it. It was a problem. I would tell you, Geraud and the team, they fixed it. Today, that is a world-class factory. It's ace gold. I think you'll see the same kind of focus on the Fire & Security business in Europe that you saw on that particular problem. We'll get it fixed. It's just going to take a little bit of time. So I think most of the bad news is behind us, but certainly not all of it on F&S. So it will be a tough 2012.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And can you just give us a bit more granularity on Transicold? Obviously, it's down in Q1. But what's actually going on with the orders there? And is that business kind of on track, it's kind of down for the year, maybe some geographic color around that also?", "Unknown Executive", "Sure. So on Transicold, if we look across the business, the orders in the fourth quarter were down low-double digits, with container down the most, down about 30%. And Europe Truck Trailer also saw some weakness, down low-double digits as well. And what you really see there is the impact of the economic conditions in Europe and the availability of credit for some of the customers. North America Trailer, Truck Trailer, however, was up over 100%. And now we see some of the trailer OEMs finalizing their Q1 delivery schedules, so we feel pretty good about that.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Just to add, the orders there are pretty lumpy. Containers orders were down. I think, the fundamental structural issue in Europe is probably a bigger concern for the year, as we see creditors tighten up for credit availability to our customers. But overall, it will be down after a record year in 2011. But it's not a train wreck by any stretch of the imagination, so they're a very, very solid business this year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "If I had looked at where you started in December with your contingency of, call it, $130 million, it seems like both pension and FX probably absorbed most of that. Should I be thinking about it now with this additional potential gains as a cushion in the $300 million range?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, really good, Sam. Yes, if you think about it, at the midpoint of the guidance range at $590 million, we had about $130 million of contingency. We've lost about $50 million of that to the higher pension costs with the lower discount rate. And the rest of it, if you take a snapshot of the euro today and the exchange rates, we probably lost another $70 million or $80 million. So the contingency at the midpoint is essentially evaporated. However, and we talked about this additional $300 million of gain. My own view is that, we'll use half of it or so on the Goodrich deal costs and restructuring, and the other half, we'll just build contingency for us. So really, what I'd like to think of it as that we still got $150 million of contingency because the bad news that we talked about so far on pension and FX is really covered by the other half of the gain. So we're kind of at the same spot that we were, even though the euro is lower and pension is worse 6 weeks later.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then in your slide, you talked about a couple onetime items that, I guess, weren't part of how you had it in the release. But can you size the gain on the contract termination at Pratt and on the U.K. guarding business?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. The Pratt gain on the contract termination was about $0.04. So I think the piece on F&S was about $0.01. That was a sale of our security, one of our security manned guarding businesses in the U.K.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And then the last question, how should we think about the Thailand piece of Carrier? How big of an impact is that? How much does that change things in 2012?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I would say, we don't expect the factory to be back up in production until the second quarter. I think last year, we generated about $30 million of earnings there in the first quarter. So those earnings will go completely away. Obviously, it will have an impact a little bit into the second quarter, so we're probably going to lose almost half a year's production in the -- out of Thailand. So things are pretty tough first half.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A question a little bit on the cap on the balance sheet side. You started the year with a debt to cap at 31%, net debt to cap is 16%. I know you've got sort of a matrix of ideas that -- and you're working with the rating agencies on different alternatives. But can you give a sense as to maybe what the range of the balance sheet would look like kind of post facto?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, there's a lot more debt. Yes, I think, as you think about -- as you said, debt to cap is 31% today. We've got a lot of cash on the balance sheet, over $6 billion of cash. There's $1.5 billion of that cash that was going to go to pay for the IAE transaction, which we expect to close in the second quarter. So that cash is somewhat spoken for. I think debt to cap is going to migrate up towards the 50% post deal. And again, it's really a question of how much debt we have to issue versus equity. But you can kind of think of it in that 50% range. And then over the next 2 to 3 years, we'll bring it back down, as we pay off a big chunk of this. I think the good news is, cash generation was exceptionally strong for the year. We continue to see strong cash generation in 2012. And I think, Goodrich is going to be a better investment than anybody would have thought. I think, again, we think there's nothing but upside there, especially with their aftermarket businesses. So it's going to be a little lumpy. And again, I think, once we understand what we're going to be from a portfolio standpoint in March and we lay that out for you, you'll get to see what the real debt to cap looks like. But I don't anticipate it going north of 50%, when we're all said and done.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right, great. And then a question on Hamilton. When should we start to -- when does the provisional spares in the 787 start to tick up and how's that going to affect the margins, if at all?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, we've actually started to see it in the fourth quarter. The big piece of the aftermarket growth at Hamilton in the fourth quarter was 787. We'll see some more incremental benefit this year. It's not real big. It's probably less than $0.02 of earnings out of that. But the big piece of what we're doing, though, especially with some of the initial airlines, we're providing a care package, which is our kind of nose-to-tail support. So the provisioning is going to be a little bit muted versus what you would normally see on a new program. But again, the economics of that program, we provide and we provision for the spares and the support and we get paid for that on an hourly basis. That actually is a pretty good deal for us. So we get a little bit of benefit this year, year-over-year, but it's not huge.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right. And then last question, on the Pratt and Whitney, on the new engine shipments. Your large commercial deliveries were up 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and you, obviously, you had a good surge in the third quarter. Can you tell us a little bit on a quarterly basis, how the new engines shipments look over 2012?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I don't know that I've got a breakdown of 2012. I think, if you think about that 40% improve or increase in 2011, a big piece of that, that's like 44 engines, I guess. Big piece of that was V2500s. I think we shipped about 27 of V2500s and 14 of the GP7000s. As you know, we only get about 1/3 of the revenue out of the Vs and 50% out of the GP7000. So it was nice shipments. I think, we're going to continue to see that kind of volume into 2012. But I don't know that we have -- I'm just looking here if we have that.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It makes sense, Greg, just as we think about it, given the production ramp in 2013, that we'd start to see it more and more in the back half of this year?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think what you're going to see is a continuation of what we saw in the third and fourth quarter at Pratt. You're going to continue to see Vs increase with the production line increasing at Airbus. And as the ramp rate on the A380 increases again, you're going to see the GP  pickup at kind of the rates that we're seeing in the third and fourth quarter.", "Unknown Executive", "Just to add to that a little bit. For the whole year, at least, 2012, we do see total commercial engine shipments up low-single digits, with the Vs up almost 10% for the high-single digit.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Deane Dray of Citi Investment Research.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Before the expected sale of these non-core assets, I know we're going to hear more about it in March, but might some of these sales be completed in 2012? And would there be gains on these transactions?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes and yes. And again, I can't be too specific, Deane. Obviously, as we look at this, the key to any of these transactions is to actually get it completed this year, really, to fund the Goodrich deal. And whether we're going to use it to pay down debt or reduce the amount of equity, we're still working through that. But you would expect these businesses, although they're non-core, that doesn't mean they're bad businesses. In fact, I think, there could be some very good businesses out there that just aren't core but that will generate significant interest in the marketplace. It's going to take us some time. I would expect, again, we'll lay this out in a couple of months. We'll start to process around some of these divestitures, but it will probably take us most of the year, but our target right now is to have all of the divestitures done in 2012.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Now, but the gains there, in theory, that would take you well above the contingency. So would that be potential more restructuring offsets?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. I think, again, those gains equal restructuring math is --we're going to try and continue to do that. But it's really hard to tell you what the gains are going to be out of these businesses. It's a little early.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Of course. And then, just last question for me. I know you've got a question mark regarding the impact on Europe, but it didn't seem to have much of an effect in the fourth quarter. Could you just comment on what you're seeing real time in terms of customer behavior, destocking? Any color there would be helpful.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It's really, an interesting thing about Europe is Carrier's business, the commercial HVAC business, in the fourth quarter was actually up 8% year-over-year. And it's not related to commercial construction activity in Europe, it's really related to just the push for energy efficiency in the replacement market. Otis was not quite the same story. Obviously, it's a bigger business for them. They had more pressure in Europe. But the fact is, I think, Europe is just -- it's going to be a tough road ahead. I think we've -- the good news about UTC, balance works. It's 25% of the sales come out of Europe. We don't expect much growth, but we don't expect any big surprises. Maybe just to kind of put it in context. In 2009, Europe was down 14% as was the U.S. and I think even Asia and emerging markets were down like 16% or 17%. In 2010 and 2011, we saw a 2% growth in the euro. So if you think about it, we're still down 10% from the peak. So there's still opportunities there, but I think it's going to be a very long, slow growth to recovery in Europe. And again, we'll see how this debt crisis plays itself out. I'm not all that concerned. A big chunk of what we do in Europe is obviously service-related, which seems to be pretty resilient.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm a little confused on the EPS guidance. I just want to kind of walk through this again. Because your guidance, you didn't update us on the guidance including Goodrich. And it looks like half of the new gains are offsetting deal costs, but those weren't part of your x Goodrich EPS guidance. So, Greg, any -- I don't know, can you illuminate that a little bit?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Sorry for the confusion. The way we have laid this out, we've got the base business of $5.80 to $6, right? 6% to 9% growth. And what we've done is, we've allocated half of this additional gain as contingency there, really, to cover the pension and FX impact. The other half, call it, $150 million, we'll use to offset either deal costs or restructuring at Goodrich, post close. So if you think about it, we talked about $0.50 of dilution related to Goodrich. I think that's probably $0.10 better on the low end, so probably only about $0.40. So if you want to take $0.40 off the top at the low end, you can figure out the Goodrich impact. The reason we're reluctant to give guidance specifically on the Goodrich dilution is we're still working through this equity issuance and the impact on that versus debt, as well as the impact associated with any divestitures. So we're trying to focus people on the base business for now. In another 1.5 months or so, I think you'll have a lot more clarity on this Goodrich. But if you're just trying to do the simple math today, I'd tell you, you can put a $0.10 off or take a $0.10 off the $0.50 we gave you in December.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And the way to think about the $5.80 is to $6 is, basically, you lost $1.50 from the 2 items you mentioned and you picked that back up with half the gains we're talking about?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. I think that's the simplest way to think about it.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then over at Otis, your margins -- your adjusted margins have been up something like 15 straight years and your guidance this year calls for a bit of a downtick, and you've done that before and beaten numbers. So what's different this year that should compress margins?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think the big difference this year is the growth that we expect in new equipment. And as we've been talking about for the last 8 quarters is pricing has been pretty tough on new equipment, really, across the globe. And so as you see that growth in new equipment which -- I mean, I'll just take a look at my notes here. It's kind of up high-single digits, call it, 7% or so. You're not going to get a lot of conversion out of that. So sales will be up, but you're just not going to see a lot of bottom line conversion on those sales as most of those we got with really low margin.", "Unknown Executive", "So we're expecting service growth to be up mid-single digits. So the new equipment growth is outpacing the service growth. The other thing to just keep in mind is there will be some commodity headwinds, as well as FX headwind next year at Otis, so that will also impact margins.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. I think we've been telling people all along, a 20%-plus margins are always the goal even after the recovery. So when we get to a more normal split of new equipment versus service, I think you'll see a little bit of margin pressure. Margins are still going to be industry-leading. I think it's hard to argue with the success of Otis over the last 15 years.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally, I hear you on the China -- the Otis China backlog going into 2012. And so you have some visibility there despite the reduction in the growth rate from the government side. But as we think about orders, what's your embedded expectation for Otis China orders in 2012? And I'd ask the same question on Pratt commercial spares. What order growth do you expect for the full year?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think, it will probably be double digit is what's in the base assumption. So we kind of figure that at the 10%, 12% kind of range for Otis, for new equipment. On the Pratt side for spares, it's about 5% growth for the year. And again, it's double that at Hamilton. And I would just point out, you got a lot more visibility at Pratt in terms of the engine overhauls, and when they're coming into the shop. So I think Pratt's got a lot more fidelity around that 5%. As you take a look at Hamilton with their 10%, that really is out of the back of what they consider to be a 5% growth in revenue passenger miles or available seat miles this year plus the price increase that went into effect on January 1. So a little bit better performance on the aftermarket at Hamilton. But I still feel pretty confident on the Pratt aftermarket given the visibility we have.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I just have a follow-up on Joe's question about the Pratt aftermarket, Greg. Is there anything changing here? Are we seeing any sort of fundamental slowdown in the airline demand for engine spares or overhaul, is this really just down to tough comparison and maybe the end of initial restocking?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. I think that's exactly it. We actually -- we track heavy versus light overhauls and we continue to see, really, over the last 8 quarters, airlines are starting to do more and more of the heavy overhauls versus the light. I think it's almost 88% now on our heavy overhauls. So we have good visibility. Now you do have, of course, Pratt's got an older fleet. You see some 757s coming out of production. You see MD-80s , of course, being retired in America and such. So I think part of this is just the natural aging of the Pratt fleet. But also just the fact that we have that kind of a nice recovery second half of 2010, all the way through 2011. So you just have a much tougher compares.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second question, on the A320neo, I just wonder if you could comment on how your market share has been shipping up with the geared turbofan there, and what your expectations might be going forward?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think, again, we've -- obviously, we had a great start to 2011. It was a little bit of a slowdown in the middle of the year. But at the end of the year, I think we're still having at least 50% of the market and we still believe we can get 50%-plus as customers look at the value of the GTF versus the LEAP. So yes, it's going to be a the long slog as you know. I think that the best news is we've got orders for over 2,000 engines now in backlog that weren't there a year ago. So still, again, it's a tough market out there. We got tough competition with CFM. But again, the technology, the GTF technology will trump the other engine, we think, at the end of the day. We also, of course, have the benefits of the IAE transaction coming in here where, again, we'll take control of IAE hopefully here in the first half and can give us a very smooth transition, that will allow us to work with customers and our current V customers and try and convert some of those even to GTF on the follow-on orders.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "On Sikorsky, you mentioned the profit shortfall of pure military deliveries in the quarter, maybe $25 million, $35 million of EBIT shortfall. But then on the 2012 outlook, it wasn't updated. So number one, there's no catch up; and number two, it would imply 2012 outlook is also implicitly lower.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I would disagree with you on the second point. The fact is, we did miss some helicopters at end of the year. There were like 6 BLACK HAWKs that did not go. We're still 100% on contract to the U.S. government. So this is not a big issue in terms of production problems at Sikorsky. Again, we were on time. We hope to get these 6 aircraft out. We've gotten about half of them out in the first couple of weeks of January. The rest will go here in the first few months. So if you think about it, last year, we had their guidance up $25 million to $50 million. We still think they're going to be up the same to the same net amount even though the base is lower. So implicitly, their guidance should be up, that $35 million risk that you have out there.", "Unknown Executive", "And one thing to keep in mind is that, we talked about how the pension came in with the discount rate being lower, so there's higher pension headwind going into next year. So some of that will go to Sikorsky and that may offset some of the benefits.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Mrs. Lee [ph] is exactly correct and I stand corrected there. So it's about $10 million of pension headwind out of that $50 million that we talked about. So if you think about it, there's probably $25 million of upside to Sikorsky on an absolute basis from where they ended last year. But again, I think, nothing's fundamentally wrong with the business. It will perform this year. We said Military is down, but we're seeing good strength on the Commercial side and then -- especially on the International Military side there. As we said, more than 50 orders last year from International customers, so that will continue.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the 2012 cash outlook, Greg, it just seems like it could be very, very strong, and certainly more strong than the underlying EPS, when the Goodrich deal is said and done. Are there any puts and takes? Obviously, pension, it sounds like that will be a nice tailwind on a year-on-year basis from a cash perspective. D&A will be -- help cash conversion. How are working capital and cash taxes looking?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think, again, as you think about the base business, I think again we'll continue to deliver strong cash flows. It's a little early to say that we're going to exceed net income for the year for cash flows on the base business. But you'll see the same kind of performance year-on-year, I think, in 2012, that you saw in 2011. I think the good news in cash flow, the thing about fourth quarter performance, we actually saw inventory up, I think, it was $36 million or $37 million year-over-year on a 7% increase in sales. So I think good working capital performance, good inventory performance in the fourth quarter. Hope to get that traction or hope that traction will continue into 2012. Once we do the Goodrich transaction, obviously, there's a significant amount of amortization costs, which are non-cash charges. I think that's about, what, $300 million for a full year, $150 million. So obviously, that gives us a good visibility, that you're going to see a stronger cash post-acquisition than the typical normal cash equal to net income.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a clarification, what was the -- in the quarter, the $250 million of other operating activities net versus $400 million headwind last year?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think those are primarily on the taxes side. The taxes, it'd just be, again, some refunds on taxes that we had not expected.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Julian Mitchell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "First, I guess, within the CCS business. You talked about the moving parts inside Transicold in Q4. I guess, what's embedded in your CCS expectations for Transicold, just the overall Transicold business in 2012? Obviously, it's had a decent sort of margin effect over the last kind of 12 to 18 months. For the year '12, globally in that business, do you still think sales and profits should be up?", "Unknown Executive", "I think overall for Transicold markets, we expect that they're down high-single digits. And so with the Container market down over 10%, that's we're seeing special strength there, now we expect down over 10%, U.S. Trailer up mid-single digits and Europe Trailer market down -- or flat to down 5%.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then just on Sikorsky, when you touched on it just now. But -- and there are a bunch of restructuring announcements sort of as you went through 2011. And obviously, end of the year, a little bit soft in terms of the profits number in the end. When you're thinking about the cost savings for '12, given the top line, is there kind of a fresh new restructuring plan kind of being dusted off for Sikorsky? Or will it be the same thing while we're going through the year sort of step-by-step?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think Jeff did a lot of preemptive restructuring. I think in the fourth quarter, we spent $37 million at Sikorsky to address what we saw as the coming volume declines on the military side. I think that right sizes the business for right now. If you see any further deterioration, obviously, I think there's always opportunity for additional restructuring. But I think again, that $37 million was really to be preemptive, to position us to grow earnings in 2012.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just kind of going back to Otis again and demand. I think you talked a little bit about demand in China, but you've been adding capacity both in Brazil and India, and how are those markets playing out so far for Otis?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Brazil has actually been very strong for us and India has continued to see growth as well. So those are big opportunities. They don't have nearly the scale that China has. If you think about China, there must be almost $2 billion of revenue. So these are our smaller businesses. But again, I think, the growth prospects that we've seen, we think we were building the factories, so that we can deliver, let's say, 10,000 units in India this year and I think that seems to be on track. In Brazil, we just put in a new factory there to meet the increasing demand, and I think there's been nothing on the horizon that indicates that we're not going to see that happen.", "Unknown Executive", "Just to note, the new equipment sales in Brazil were up over 30% in the fourth quarter. The orders were up mid-to-high teens. And India, the sales were a little bit down in the quarter, but that's -- we think the orders are still pretty strong there and the market is fundamentally strong.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then, maybe just a quick detailed question. In Fire & Security, you took those impairment on in equity investment, what was that?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It was an investment in a manufacturer in China that we made several years. We actually took a small impairment charge in the third quarter on that. It's a small equity investment that we have. I think we have 30% or so of the business. It's still traded on the Hong Kong Exchange. And unfortunately, we have to mark it down to fair market value because on the Hong Kong Exchange, the stock has gone down significantly since the acquisition. Still a good business, it's just that we had to face the reality that the publicly-traded piece was trading in at a significant discount to what we considered to be fair value. So we had to take the write-down in the fourth quarter. But again, I think there's -- we'll work through that as part of this whole portfolio rationalization. Whether or not that stays as part of the CCS portfolio, I think we haven't decided yet. But we took a conservative accounting view towards it.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe just one last quick one for you. Clipper, what's going on with Clipper?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Clipper is, sales last year were north of about $300 million. We took some orders here in the fourth quarter. We continue to deliver on the backlog. We continue to spend on the engineering side to build the next generation of wind power. This is yet a small piece of the business. It's part of Pratt Power Systems now. Peter Christman and Dave has continued to look at the business and work to improve that. But it's a very tough market out there. It's just going to be a tough story for a while on the wind side in the U.S.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So your legal expense, the $0.05, was that -- you mentioned for export disclosure, is that an FCPA issue?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "It's not.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It's not.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good. And then secondly, at Pratt you had huge volume in the final quarter, and yet you're still talking about high single-digit gains. I assume, like $700 million of that is kind of adding an IAE, but does that mean like 5% growth excluding that? Can you walk us through the pieces because I think you said, what, Military up 10%, that seems high. So how do we get to 5% or so excluding IAE?", "Unknown Executive", "So you're right. Organically, it is up more mid-single digit if we exclude the IAE transaction. We see commercial spares up mid-single digits. Greg mentioned that before. As well as Pratt Canada, up high-single digits and then Military up to 10% and that pretty much gets you there.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And how do you get Military up 10%? Because, what, C-17, F-22 are tracking flat to down.", "Unknown Executive", "Right. So the OEM shipments are actually down mid-teens. It has more to do with mix and there's more JSF that offsets the decline.", "Operator", "Our final question is from Douglas Harned of Sanford Bernstein.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I'm interested in understanding what you're seeing on pricing. If you look at 2012, the kind of pricing increases you might be looking for both in Pratt, Hamilton Sundstrand aftermarket, as well as Otis and Carrier.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think on the Aerospace side, it's pretty simple. When we put our catalog out the 1st of October. That took effect here 1st of January. It was roughly a 5% increase in spares prices. And as you know, that typically sticks. But especially at Pratt, you've got a big chunk of the business that's on long-term maintenance program. So they don't actually realize that full 5%, it's more like 3% or so, they'll probably realize net. Hamilton will get a little bit more even though, again, the percentage of theirs is on a long-term agreements. On the commercial side, pricing remains difficult at Otis on the OE side. It's true in China, it's true in Europe and it's true here in the U.S. And again, that's the price impression that we talked about and why you're going to see margin deterioration at Otis in 2012 on higher new equipment, just the pricing is very tough. Carrier is a little better story. Carrier actually did increase prices back in, I think, October again as commodities started to spike. We've seen that stick. In fact, there was no commodity impact in the fourth quarter because of pricing offsets. And I think again, for the full year 2012, we expect a similar story, not a lot of commodity headwinds. So it should be a, again, the residential side, despite of a poor market, everybody has the same input costs. We've said this before. I mean, copper is an input, compressors are an input, a little bit on the steel and everybody feels the same pressure. So again, I think as the market remains disciplined, we're able to realize those price increases.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "But on Otis, are you seeing more competitive intensity on the OE side? How does it changed?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I don't think there's any change really, this is for the last 8 quarters, I think, since we saw the downturn in 2009. We've continued to see very aggressive pricing from all the competitors. Be it Kone Oyj or in Schindler or all of the Chinese competitors. It's a very, very competitive OE market. I'll point out, Otis continues to have sound margins because we can leverage scale. And that's the beauty of Otis, right? Big, big factories, leverage scale in the factories, leverage scale on the supply chains.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And then if I can have one more, on Fire & Security. When you talk about shaping the portfolio, can you define what is core in Fire & Security? You've got a wide spectrum of businesses there. How do you think about what the core part is, and where there might be opportunities to shape it?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think, as you think about the Fire & Security portfolio, I think there were 61 acquisitions that we did since 2003. Obviously, I think some of the Fire & Security products are probably turning out to be much better than some of the installation businesses out of the security side. So I can't tell you which businesses we might divest. I will tell you that we're going to look at those business that have a good long-term growth prospects and have scale. In the U.S., not much scale on the installation side. We like the Fire business. It's a lot like Otis. It's about life safety, and that's what drives growth long term there, drives good margins. So I would tell you, Fire is core and we'll take a look at the rest of it. I still don't want to get ahead of ourselves here because we've some good service and installation businesses around the world that performed very well. There's some that don't perform as well. So to make sure, all we just need is to determine whether or not they're fixable and what the long-term growth prospects are before we make any decision.", "Okay. Well, I want to thank everybody for listening on the call. We've got good momentum going into 2012, and we've got the transformational deals out there. The goal at UTC as always, we focus on what we control and we outperform peers. ", "So with that, I look forward to seeing everybody on the 15th of March, and Maria [ph] and Josh will be around to take your calls afterwards.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Maria Lee [ph], Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and onetime items as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectation and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thank you, Stephanie, and good morning to everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, first quarter earnings per share were up 24% year-over-year to $1.31. That includes $0.21 of gain in excess of restructuring. Excluding these items for both years, earnings per share grew 2% to $1.10, which is a little better than we expected back in March. Keep in mind, these results include $0.13 per share of headwind from higher pension costs, higher E&D and negative FX. ", "Stronger sales in our U.S. Residential HVAC business towards the end of the quarter drove better-than-expected operating profit at UTC Climate, Controls & Security. On the other hand, while we know the urbanization trend will drive continued long-term growth, as we said in March, our business in China is off to a slow start. Otis new equipment sales in China were down 9% in constant currency in the first quarter.", "The ongoing government effort to bring housing prices down has negatively impacted the higher end of the residential sector, which represents about half of Otis' China sales. We've also seen some pricing pressure in China and a temporary impact as a result of the Beijing Metro incident last year. We've addressed the root cause of the incident, and we're confident it's been corrected. ", "As we all know, the global economy remains uneven. We have seen some encouraging signs in the U.S. over the past few months with an increase in residential construction and an improvement in consumer confidence. However, with continued weakness in Europe and the short-term slowdown in construction activity in China, we'll continue to focus on what we control, as we usually do. ", "In the quarter, we invested $111 million in restructuring, and the businesses continue to find ways to reduce structural costs. As a result, we're taking up our estimate for restructuring for the year to $450 million including the Goodrich-related restructuring actions. That's up $100 million from our expectations in March. ", "We also continue the process of evaluating and reshaping the UTC portfolio to position the company for long-term sustainable growth. And just as we did through the 2008, 2009 recession, we continue to invest in E&D, spending an incremental $77 million or $0.06 a share in the first quarter over the prior years, as we continue to develop innovative technologies like the GTF and S-97 RAIDER that will give us a sustainable competitive advantage and deliver real value to the customers. ", "So despite the uneven economic outlook, we remain confident in the full year expectations for earnings per share of $5.30 to $5.50. That's 0% to 4% growth on sales of $61 billion to $62 billion, and that guidance includes the sales impact in net $0.25 EPS dilution from the proposed Goodrich acquisition, which we still expect to close at mid-year. ", "As you heard from the business unit presidents in March, much of the operating profit growth will come in the back half of the year. As the year progresses, we'll see more normal year-on-year comparisons across our businesses, and we believe that the Chinese government will continue to pull back on some of the tightening measures, which should lead to improvement in the high-end residential construction market in China. ", "Okay, turning to first quarter results on Slide 2. Total sales were down 2%. Organic sales growth was 1% and in line with our expectations after a strong 9% organic growth in the first quarter of last year. Hamilton Sundstrand led the way this quarter with 10% organic revenue growth on strength in both commercial and military aerospace. Sikorsky sales, on the other hand, were down 15% organically following 15% growth on the first quarter of last year due to the absence of international development aircraft, as well as lower-than-expected shipments at the end of the quarter. Total segment operating profit was down 2% driven by the commercial businesses. The slow start in China and ongoing weakness in the European markets drove Otis' operating profit down 6% on flat sales. ", "UTC Climate, Controls & Security's operating profit was down 5%. In March you'll recall, we had expected CCS to be down around 10% after 70% growth in the first quarter of last year, but a strong rebound in residential cooling orders at the end of the quarter provided some unexpected upside. Hamilton Sundstrand had another strong quarter with 15% operating profit growth from solid conversion on organic sales growth. ", "Segment operating margins were down 10 basis points. A continued focus on cost reduction and productivity nearly offset the $0.13 of headwind we talked about from E&D, pension and FX, and about half of that headwind is actually in Pratt's results for the quarter. ", "As I mentioned, earnings per share were $1.31. That's up 24%. A $0.23 gain from the 2006 through 2008 tax settlements and a $0.16 gain from the sale of a controlling interest in a CCS joint venture was partially offset by $0.09 of restructuring, $0.08 of impairment on assets held for sale at CCS and an additional $0.01 for the legal reserve for the previously disclosed export licensing compliance matters. ", "Excluding restructuring in all these onetime items in both years, earnings per share grew 2%. As I said, FX had a negative impact of $0.02 in the quarter. On top of that, deal cost from the Goodrich acquisition was an additional $0.02 of headwind. ", "Free cash flow in the quarter was 95% of net income. As you saw in the press release, net income also had the benefit of noncash items, so once again, very strong free cash flow generation as you've come to expect. We spent $72 million on acquisitions in the quarter and there is no share repurchase. You'll recall, we decided to suspend share buyback last September as a result of the Goodrich transaction. With our domestic pension plan 90% funded at a discount rate of 4.6%, there will be no additional contributions to the domestic pension plans in 2012. ", "Slide 3 now on orders briefly. You see selected order trends. Pratt & Whitney large commercial engines spare orders were actually down 3% following the 33% growth in last year's first quarter. Hamilton Sundstrand's commercial spares were up 1% with strength in 787 initial provisioning, and this follows 23% growth in the first quarter of 2011. Obviously tough compares, but still confident in our outlook for the year. We're keeping a close eye on oil prices due to the impact on airline profitability. Of course on the flip side of these higher oil prices, this just enhances the value of the GTF offering, which will provide a 16% better fuel efficiency than current engine design. ", "On CCS, North American Residential HVAC orders were up 10%. It's obviously better than we expected with a robust activity late in the quarter. At Otis, new equipment orders were down 10% at constant currency. Otis' new equipment orders in China contracted 21% at constant currency after growing 7% in the fourth quarter. And we continue to believe in our emerging market strategies, which allow us to leverage our worldwide scale to deliver innovative products in a cost-efficient way and deliver real value to our customers from Mumbai to Chengdu to S\u00e3o Paulo. We continue to see strong but moderating growth in these emerging markets, consistent with our expectations and, of course, well ahead of the growth rates in the developed markets. Although China orders were down 15% in the quarter across UTC, we saw a good traction in the other BRIC markets with Brazil, Russia and India each up over 20% in the quarter. ", "So the first quarter results, a little better than we expected from what we told you just a few weeks ago. I'll come back and talk about the year a little bit more detail but first, let me turn it over to Maria [ph] to take you through the business unit results.", "Unknown Executive", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. At Otis, operating profit was down 6% in the quarter on flat sales. Operating margin was 21.4%, 140 basis points lower than prior year. Foreign currency translation reduced both sales and profit growth by about 1 point. At constant currency, new equipment sales were flat, as a 9% decline in China was offset by continued growth in other emerging markets. On the same basis, service sales were up led by growth in modernization and contractual maintenance. Pricing pressure in Europe, higher commodity costs and a slow start in China more than offset the benefits of cost reduction action in the quarter. At constant currency, new equipment orders were down 10% with China down 21%. Consistent with guidance from the March Analyst Meeting, we expect the new equipment market in China to be up low- to mid-single digits for the year. ", "Otis will aggressively pursue restructuring actions this year. Otis' full year guidance of $50 million to $75 million of profit growth on mid-single-digit sales growth assumes savings from further cost reductions, as well as improvement in the top line especially in China for the balance of the year. ", "On Slide 5, UTC Climate, Controls & Security profit contracted 5% in the quarter on 6% lower sales resulting in margin of 11.4%, up 20 basis points from prior year. Organic sales were up 1% following 12% growth in the first quarter of last year. Mid-single-digit organic growth in Europe and automation and controls businesses was partially offset by modest contraction in Asia and Transicold as well as the impact of our Thailand factory, which resumed operations in March. ", "As Greg mentioned, better-than-expected profit performance was driven by strong U.S. Residential HVAC orders in the second half of March. This drove low-single-digit growth in split systems unit shipments for the quarter as CCS benefited from warmer-than-normal temperatures across much of the U.S. ", "About half of the $25 million year-over-year profit decline is driven by the absence of a gain on the sale of the U.K. guarding business last year. The balance is largely in the Americas business primarily lower furnace volume. For the full year, CCS continues to expect operating profit growth of about $225 million on 4% organic sales growth, but given the recently announced portfolio transactions, reported sales will be down low single digits. ", "Turning to aerospace on Slide 6. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 6% in the first quarter including 1 point of unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Sales growth was driven by higher Military and Pratt Canada engine sales and higher industrial volume at Power Systems and was partially offset by lower commercial aftermarket and engine deliveries. Large commercial spares were down 4% year-over-year. ", "Operating profit in the quarter was down 1%. Higher E&D, pension costs and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada were partially offset by the benefit of net higher sales and restructuring savings, as well as the benefit from a contract termination of about $0.02. For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney operating profit to be down $25 million to $50 million on high single-digit sales growth. ", "Hamilton Sundstrand posted a strong quarter with profit growth of 15% on 9% higher sales. Sales growth came from both OEM and aftermarket, each up high single digits. 787 provisioning sales drove the aftermarket growth. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by the benefits of increased aftermarket volume and lower E&D. This was partially offset by higher pension costs. Operating margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year to 16.2%. For the full year, we continue to expect Hamilton Sundstrand's operating profit to be up $75 million to $100 million and sales up high single digits. ", "Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 8. Operating profit declined by 2% on 15% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 39 aircraft. 34 aircraft were based on military platforms and 5 commercial. Sales were lower driven by 19 fewer aircraft deliveries, including the absence of international development aircraft and lower U.S. government deliveries. On profit, benefit from strong aftermarket performance and the absence of one Canadian Maritime Helicopter was offset by lower military aircraft deliveries and higher E&D spend. Of note during the quarter, Sikorsky signed a contract with Bond Aviation Group for 16 firm S-92 helicopters, marking the largest onetime order of S-92 aircraft ever received. For the full year, we continue to expect profit growth of approximately $50 million to $75 million on mid-single-digit sales decline. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thank you, Maria [ph]. But before we get into the full year, let me just give you an update on some of the other activities going on at UTC, and there is a lot of things going on. And so the good news is they're all on track. Our 2 new organizations, CCS and PAS, are both in place, and we're encouraged by the results so far. First, at CCS, Climate, Controls & Security, Geraud and the team are progressing well with the integration of our new organization, and they've begun the portfolio transformation of the legacy Fire & Security business, with the divestiture of the U.S. branch operations announced earlier this month. CCS has also formed a joint venture with Watsco for distribution in Canada, building on our successful partnership in the United States. All of this comes while CCS continues to innovate and produce the most efficient solutions for both our residential and commercial customers. ", "On the aerospace side, Alain and the team at Propulsion and Aerospace systems continue to make great progress on the Goodrich integration planning. We've also fine-tuned our financing plan, reducing the need for an equity issuance from $4 billion to only $1.5 billion. And we've made good progress on the divestitures that we announced last month, and we're on track to complete these divestitures before year end. Whereas proceeds from these divestitures will help finance the Goodrich acquisition and more importantly allow us to focus on our core business of aerospace and commercial buildings. We expect to sign a contract shortly for Rocketdyne, and initial bids show a very strong interest for the industrial businesses. As you saw on the press release this morning, we recorded charges in the first quarter in discontinued operations, but we expect net gains for the full year as the sale of these businesses is completed. ", "Okay. At Pratt & Whitney in the quarter, we secured an additional 156 firm orders for the A320 engine. The GTF engine continues to validate performance characteristics in testing with now over 2,100 hours complete and the first flight of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet engine scheduled for later this month. ", "So a good progress in our new organization, and we continue to execute on the transformational changes to the UTC portfolio. ", "As for the outlook for 2012, we remain confident in our guidance of $5.30 to $5.50. That's 0% to 4% growth, as I said, on sales of $61 billion to $62 billion including Goodrich. Q1 was a little better than expected but as we told you, most of the operating profit growth will still be in the back half. Sikorsky shipments are weighted towards the back half with about 1/3 in the first half and 2/3 in the back half. CCS faces easier compares and will realize more benefit from the integration and portfolio transformation. At Otis, still expects improvement in the new equipment market as the year progresses. ", "As for other elements of our guidance, we have visibility of an additional $100 million of gains, so we now expect $600 million for the full year. And we expect the excess of $0.21 gain from the first quarter will be offset in the back half of the year with restructuring in both Goodrich and the core business. ", "We expect engineering development to increase by about $150 million primarily at Pratt & Whitney. And our first quarter operational tax rate came in right where we expected at 32%, and we continue to expect an operational tax rate for full year of 29.5% although, of course, there's volatility across the quarters. On cash flow, we continue to expect free cash flow to equal or exceed net income for the full year. ", "With our transformational deals, the new organization, industry-leading franchises and a sustained focus on structural cost reduction, we are well-positioned for long-term earnings growth. ", "With that, let me stop and open up the call for questions. Stephanie?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Greg, can you give us a little more color on where you're actually going after the additional restructuring with the gains that you're finding and some color on kind of resulting benefits from restructuring in 2012 and 2013?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think, we did about $111 million of restructuring I think in the first quarter. That really was spread out. With Otis, there was about $28 million; CCS, about $35 million; Pratt, $37 million; and a little bit of Sikorsky and Hamilton. I think you're going to continue to see spending in those 3 businesses primarily. Certainly as Geraud continues with the CCS portfolio transformation, you're going to see additional restructuring actions there. Otis, again, continues to look for ways to reduce some structural costs, so I think you'll see additional restructuring at Otis and the same at Pratt & Whitney. So I think the 3 big businesses will probably get the bulk of it. And also keep in mind, there'll probably $150 million of restructuring associated with the Goodrich acquisition. So again, that's all back half.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Should we expect those restructuring costs to pay back in similar dollars into 2013, or what's the payback look like?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "The payback on the programs that we're looking at today are between 1 and 2 years. I think some of the -- the Goodrich payback will be very quick and will be SG&A overhead as we eliminate some duplicative functions. Some of the bigger restructuring as we're looking at capacity will take a little bit longer. But I'll tell you, usually 1 and 2 years is the average payback we're seeing. Some of it -- some of the quicker SG&A stuff like we did at CCS earlier this year, again, we're seeing that benefit this year. And you recall, as Geraud's roadmap to $225 million had savings in there from restructuring in it.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Right. And can you elaborate a little bit more on the magnitude of price pressure at Otis, and is there any way to kind of measure how significant kind of the fallout on the Metro accident actually has been? And are you confident that, that cloud is fully lifted at this point?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, let's talk about pricing first, then we can touch on the Beijing Metro. I think last year in July, we saw the spike in rare earth metals in China, and Otis, I think, reacted very quickly to try and raise prices. In fact, I think we raised prices about 5% last July. Unfortunately, that price increase did not get much traction in the market and in fact, resulted in some of the declines that we've seen in orders even into the first quarter of this year. One of the things that Pedro and team are doing right now is going back and relooking at pricing. Obviously, the headwind from the rare earths has abated. So I think there is a good case to be made there to adjust pricing, but it certainly hurt in the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. The Beijing Metro incident, again, I think that's behind us. Again, it was a tragic accident. I think everybody is aware of an escalator incident in Beijing. Again, we've been working with the Beijing government. Again, I hope that's behind us. It's one of these difficult things, obviously, when you have an accident, it gets that kind of visibility. But we're doing the right things in terms of working with the customers and working to make sure that the brand has not been damaged in any way. The other thing you keep in mind, I think, in terms of the Otis China situation in the quarter and even into last year is the mix issue. Again, we are strongest in the residential construction market. And obviously, where the growth is coming is primarily in the social side, where we're not as strong, so been hurt by mix, we've been hurt by pricing and hurt a little bit by this Beijing Metro. So, again, all of its correctable. I think as the year progresses, we expect to have better results in China, plus you're going to see some of the tightening measures loosen there to, again, hopefully improve the outlook to get back to kind of a more normal growth rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Nadol from the JPMorgan.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question is on drilling down to Otis. Just I want to drill down a little bit more into these margins, which were a bit below our number and certainly, I think, below where they've been for a few years on a quarterly basis. And sales were flat overall for the business and the mix, from a service and OE standpoint, even improved a little bit. I understand China is good margin on the OE side. But Greg, is there any way of -- maybe, I don't know, explain a little bit more clearly what's happening there? And if you think maybe this is a blip this quarter, or we should maybe expect margins to come off a little bit from what we've used to expect -- used to expecting here?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, margins are still pretty good. I'll give you that, but they were down 140 basis points. I think, yes, there are really 2 big pieces here to the margin decline. First of all, we saw commodities, and this is as we continue to bleed off the inventory, some of these rare metals, you saw about, what, 60 basis points, I think, of margin deterioration just from commodity at the quarter, so that's a big number. The other -- another 40 basis points of contraction came from the pricing that we talked about, so that's really the biggest piece of this. And we're also -- we're continuing to make investments around the world. We're continuing to build out the CLC in Shanghai and as well as consolidated the factory down in South Carolina. So just some unusual expenses. So I'd expect, again, margin should get better, but certainly, we're not really surprised that we're contracted in the quarter.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And so the margin erosion was exclusively on the OE side, and service margins were flat or up a little bit?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No. In fact, a little bit of that pricing that we talked about actually came on the service side, and most of that came in Europe, where we continue to see a little bit of pricing pressure on service, I think Pedro mentioned that back in March.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, and then switching over to CCS. So I guess, the reduction in the sales expectation is due to the divestiture you announced. What exactly is in there now for incremental divestitures over the remainder of the year? And then additionally within the same segment, there was a nice surprise in -- I guess, in the second half of March. You got a nice surge of orders in U.S. residential. How much can we read through for the season and for Q2 specifically, and how much might this continue?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Let me take the second part of that question first, which is the res market improvement. Obviously, we stood up in March and we talked about CCS being down about 10% in earnings after being up 70% last year. Actually came in only down about 5%, and that was really on the back of this surge in orders that we saw in the residential side and really on the cooling side. Yes, I think orders were down in the first 2 months of the quarter, and then really came back, so I think overall res orders were about -- up about 10% and we think cooling was up almost 19% in the quarter. So again, all of that strength really came in the back half. Obviously, there is no heating season, so there's not much to talk about on the heating side. So again, I think we picked up a little bit of share maybe in the quarter on really a strong rebound. I guess it's not surprising. Again, we did see a pickup in the residential construction markets in the first quarter with the warm weather. It was a pleasant surprise. As far as the year in terms of what's in, I don't know, Maria [ph], do have the...", "Unknown Executive", "So yes, we have -- the organic growth for CCS remains about 4%. So the -- yes, 4% growth. FX probably account for about a 2% headwind and then acquisitions net is probably about 5% to 6% on sales.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And what do you have done right now in terms of the deals you've already announced, how much would that reduce sales at this point?", "Unknown Executive", "So the AFSS announcement was about $200 million for the rest of the year divestiture impact, and the Canadian distribution was about $100 million. So that's about $300 million incrementally from what we would have had in the prior guidance, and that's included in the sort of 4%, 5% acquisition divestiture net.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So yes, we talked about $750 million of divestitures around this portfolio transformation. We're getting towards that number, but we still have a little ways to go. So there's probably another $250 million or so that might get divested. We just won't see a full year impact of that. We'll be out in front of that with you, Joe, as we get those deals done.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Question back on -- clarification, I guess, on the CCS business. The divestiture lowered sales expectation for the year. You left EBIT intact. Is that having the resi upper in there, or were the divestitures not really contributing?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Divestitures weren't really contributing. Yes, we're still on track, I think, for res in terms of sales, up about 3% to 5%, and the guidance is still up $225 million. And I would tell you the res although was good for the end of March into early April here, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves with the cooling season here. We saw this play out last year. We had a very strong first quarter and then a slowdown throughout the year. So right now, the $225 million is still the guidance, and there is still a task out there to hit even that number, and Geraud has got line of sight to do that through additional restructuring. If there is some upside related to the res business, we'll certainly see that in the next quarter here. But for right now, I think we're not anticipating any big upsurge beyond that 3% to 5% that we talked about.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, the other one was on Otis in terms of the full year outlook for sales. Can you talk about what you're expecting for Otis versus the market, and if there's any share gain built into your expectation and kind of how were you in the first quarter? And if you didn't have a share gain, what would that mean to kind of the EBIT outlook?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think in the quarter, obviously, sales were flattish with earnings down 6% and we probably lost a little bit of share in China, probably held share around the rest of the world. Clearly, we're expecting to get a little bit of traction. I think we have new equipment up in the mid-single digits from a guidance standpoint. And that assumes, again, a little bit of improvement here in North America, flat in Europe and normal kind of growth rates around the rest of the world. So a little bit of share loss in the first quarter, but yes, we're expecting we'll get that back as the year progresses.", "Unknown Executive", "And one more thing just specifically on that China market. I think, we talked about the pressure that we're seeing on the high-end residential side. And we think that was sort of down double digits in the quarter. And we do think that, that will likely, with the pullback on some of the tightening measures with the China government, that will likely not be down as much for the year. So that would help the overall market in China improve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So could you give us some more color on the spares orders at Pratt and Hamilton Sundstrand? How -- were they at all impacted by kind of prebuying in the fourth quarter? And maybe some color on what you're seeing here in the early days of April.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, spares, Cai, as I said, we were down 3% at Pratt after being up 33% last year in the first quarter. So in my own view it's just a tough compare. We seem to -- we're on track, we think, at Pratt for kind of mid-single-digit growth in spares for the year. I think we've got line of sight to that based upon the shop visits that are scheduled and our talks, dealings with the airlines. So, again, first quarter was tough. Again, part of this, again, you never know how much prebuy goes on at the end of the year with price increases, so first quarter sometimes light. But yes, I think we're pretty much on track at Pratt. At Hamilton again, up 1% versus 23% last year in the first quarter, so again, a very tough compare. Repair inputs were actually down a little bit in the quarter more than expected, so that's just a timing issue. We still know that flight hours are way up. The RPMs are up, ASMs are up and capacity is up. So the airlines are still making money despite the oil prices where they are. So we're going to see the repairs come in at Hamilton. And yes, I think we've got up nearly 10% in the expectation for spares, and part of that will be the benefit from additional 787 provisioning, which continues to be robust, as well as a recovery, I think, in this repair activity.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, so some of that really looks like it was just largely timing then.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I believe it is.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "R&D was up year-over-year. I guess, you're going kind of at your annualized run rate. Is there anything in terms of the timing there? Is that going to be flat throughout the year, or how should we think about that?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So if you think about it, we were up $77 million in the quarter and a little more than $50 million of that was at Pratt, and really Pratt is now on the run rate that we expect for the rest of the year. You recall we had a slow start to last year but eventually, they were up more than $225 million in E&D. So this is really just getting Pratt on the run rate, so you'll see the increases slow down. Obviously, the $150 million expectation of increase, half of it was in the first quarter. So, again, you'll see a little bit more increase in the second and then flat now towards the back half of the year. And keep in mind, the CSeries engine should be certified by the fourth quarter, so there'll be a step-down in spending there, making good progress on the other engines as well. So again, this is the peak year for engineering spending at Pratt & Whitney. I know Mr. Bellemare, Mr. Hess are keenly aware of the commitment to you all to make sure that this is the peak year, and that still should be the case.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Last quick one, Goodrich, you said you still expect to close at mid-year. And yet given that the EC is gone into Phase 2, I mean, is it maybe more likely that mid-year would be late July or early August, which is still near mid-year? Maybe you can update us there.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. I really can't comment, Cai, on where we are with the regulators. We're obviously working with the DOJ. We're working with the EU, and we believe we're still on track, and I said mid-year. Whether that's plus or minus a couple of weeks, I couldn't handicap at that closely. But I would tell you, we're still highly confident that we're on track for -- to close the deal.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Couple quick ones. One, a sort of point of clarification on Joe's question relating to the Otis margins. I guess, so you called out 40 bps of headwind from pricing and 60 bps from the rare earth impact. But given that they were down a little bit more, it sort of implies a profit differential in China versus the other emerging markets that you called out that were growing that would be pretty substantial. Is that right? How big should we be thinking the margin differential is between China and the rest of the BRIC countries?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "The margins in China are probably -- they're comparable to overall Otis margins. Again, it's mostly a new equipment business there. If you think about it, earnings in China were obviously adversely affected and hurt margin as we lost some sales. Again, sales were down 9% in the quarter. So that obviously had an impact, but I wouldn't diminish the impact of what's going on in Europe either with a very slow start there on the service side. So yes, there's really -- it's Europe and China, I would say, are the 2 pieces of the puzzle here in terms of where we saw the earnings decline and the margin decline.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And on Pratt, you called out a favorable contract termination. I presume that helped the margins in the quarter. Can you quantify how big that may have been in Q1?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, it's about $0.01.", "Unknown Executive", "$0.02", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I'm sorry, it's about $0.02.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, and one last quick one on the 787 initial provisioning for Hamilton. Do you have a sense of how much that's contributing to your full year growth guidance for spares at Hamilton?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "The 787 provisioning?", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think it's -- last year, we contributed about, I don't know, let's say, $70 million of provisioning benefit last year from 787. We probably expect a similar amount this year, so it's a meaningful piece of the growth year-over-year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Greg, can you go through, in terms of Otis for the rest of the year, when you think about getting to your numbers, can you break it out a little bit kind of between this high-end resi piece, the public housing piece and commercial, and just give kind of a sense of what you expect for the different components?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think what we would expect, as again we said, the social housing piece, we continue to see decent growth in that market in the first quarter. We would expect to see the residential pick up in the second quarter from what we saw in the first quarter. And the commercial side is really -- it's slowing growth but still growing. Really, this is really a story about the residential, kind of the high-end residential. And as the government there has started to ease, and we have seen prices come down in the market, we continue to expect, again, the growth will come during the back half of the year, probably not going to see a lot of growth here in the second quarter. But again as the year progresses, we should see good growth. And again, China, it's a huge market for us. Obviously, most of the growth is starting to come now in the western part of the countries in places like Chengdu and Chongqing and all of those, and we've got good positions there. We've got the new Gen2 low-cost elevator in our factory in Chongqing that's going to be opening later this year, which should, again, provide some emphasis for growth and to help us attack even more of the low-end social housing.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And I mean, in terms of the higher-end resi piece, I mean, are you seeing any evidence of this loosening starting to feed through yet? And I guess, if it doesn't -- if not, I mean, is there sort of a Plan B?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I would tell you, right now, we have not seen much of an impact. Again, we still see prices, I think, last month were down about 1%. We think we saw the loosening start in the first quarter. We expect that's going to continue, but we really don't expect to see any significant movement in the market really until the second half. If that doesn't happen, obviously, there is a risk to Otis' guidance for the full year. I think about first quarter, we're down 6%. For the full year, we're talking about $50 million to $75 million. So there's obviously some need for improvement as we go throughout the year. Overall though, again, all of the risk out there in Otis, I think, is more than covered by what we have in terms of the contingency at UTC level. So we're still highly confident in the guidance. Even if Otis China doesn't recover as fast as we expect, it's still should not be an issue at the UTC level.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And just I maybe have missed it, did you go through the -- what commercial equipment and container actually did in the quarter, truck/trailer and some of the subcomponents of carrier?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We did not.", "Unknown Executive", "No. We did not. So it's from -- let's see, if you look at commercial HVAC orders, let's see, for new equipment, overall, they were up high single digits at constant currency with North America up about 20%. That continues to be strong. EMEA, up low single digits and Asia down mid single digits, so that's commercial HVAC. Did you also ask about the other pieces, Transicold?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, so Transicold. Yes, Transicold transport refrigeration as expected, that was down about 15%, kind of mid-teens range as we had expected. Again, weakness there was primarily in Europe truck/trailer as the European economy continues to sputter. I think one of the good news pieces, on commercial refrigeration we actually saw some decent kind of sales growth, so up high teens organically, which was good news. Also on the ACS business, the automated controls business, that was up revenues kind of high single digit. So a little bit of weakness at Transicold as we had expected, but pretty good on the commercial HVAC and strength in ACS and refrigeration.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Strauss from UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Greg, CCS obviously outperformed the bid in the first quarter down on the operating profit side, down about 5%, and I think you had said down 10% to 15%. You had said you guys had talked about a flat first half. Is that what you're still looking at, or is the second quarter a little bit better?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So, I think the second -- yes, we have said a flat first half with first quarter down 10%. Now with first quarter only down about 5%, I think second quarter will continue as we had expected, which means it will actually start growing earnings in the second quarter, so a little bit better first half than what we had expected.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, sorry to go back to Otis China, but I guess a couple of questions. First of all, the down 9 on new equipment, how did that compare to your expectations for the first quarter? And then looking at comps, it looks like the comps are very difficult for China in new equipment in the second and third quarter and the even in the fourth quarter. Is that correct?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, that's right. I think we saw in the second and third quarter last year was like 20%, 30% growth, then it slowed down to about 7% growth in orders in the fourth quarter of last year. As far as our expectation, obviously, we came in a little light to expectations in the first quarter, down 9% on orders that were down 21%. We went into the year with a strong backlog, up about 20% year-over-year. But again with these slowing measures out there, what are seeing is that just deferral and delay in some of the shipments from the factories to the job sites. So a little disappointing there from what we had originally expected. But again, it's only one quarter, so I'm not going to get too excited about it.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So based on the tough Q2 comps, is it fair to assume that China new equipment would be down and your expectation is down again in the second quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, I think just based on the order rates that we saw in the first quarter and the comps that you have to last year, you're probably going to see a pretty tough compare. I don't know that we have a really solid estimate for second quarter in terms of the shipments. But I would think just from 50,000 feet, it's going to be tough with the order rates where they were in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Terry Darling from Goldman Sachs.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Greg, maybe just a couple of clarifications. When you're talking about commercial HVAC up high single digits, was that revenues or was that orders?", "Unknown Executive", "That was actually both.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "For both.", "Unknown Executive", "Yes.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the -- back in the Pratt spares, are you expecting that to turn around in 2Q? I guess we're picking up a little bit of some European OEMs destocking. Maybe that has to do with the cadence of other OEMs we're thinking of in that context in terms of their pricing and you're not seeing the same thing. But sounded like you hadn't changed your full year forecast, and just wondering what the confidence is behind that.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think the order rates, we look at them every week. Pratt, probably looks at them every day, continue -- it's lumpy. First quarter, we started out strong in January, then it slowed down a little bit. But overall, again, I think what you're going to see, as the year progresses, the compares get a lot easier. I think we are up about 22% in the second quarter last year, 33% in the first and then it slowed down in the back half. So I think what you're going to naturally see is as the year progresses, the comps get easier. We ought to be able to pretty easily hit that kind of 5% growth rate in spares at Pratt.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And sorry to jump back to CCS here, I forgot one there. And that's just do you have an organic all-in on the old carrier and old Fire & Security basis as we used to know it?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I don't. I think we've given you most of the elements there. I'll tell you, the one piece we probably didn't talk about was fire products. That was up globally about 5% in orders. Now the fire service in Europe, that was actually down a little bit, down mostly in Northern Europe and offset by a little bit of strength in Southern Europe surprisingly. I think the business in the U.K. continues to stabilize, still not fixed, but at least it's not continuing down. So again, I think pretty much on track with where we expect it to be.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Greg, anything else you'd want to highlight on 2Q either from the standpoint of Sikorsky shipments or tax rate? Anything else you want to call out there?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We're going to -- I think gains will equal restructuring here in the second quarter. We've got a line of sight and some additional gains. I think the tax rate will be about what we had forecast for the full year. You're not going to see, like the first quarter, we had a higher rate. Other than that, I think it's going to be a solid second quarter. Again, the trends that we saw in the first quarter at Sikorsky should get a little bit better. Keep in mind, though, at Sikorsky, I think we had shipped 90 helicopters in the first half and so almost twice that in the second half of the year. So still a little bumpy down at Sikorsky in the second quarter. In Otis, again, we should see a recovery again. I talked about the CCS before you're getting good traction. In Pratt and Hamilton, again, pretty much on track with what we saw in the first quarter.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And sorry one more in the weeds here. On the North America Resi HVAC order strength, are you confident that pricing on that unit acceleration is at a level that is tracking in line with your profit expectations? I guess, we're picking up a little in the channel some price discounting going on by a number of OEMs on that volume lift in March.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Actually we did not see that. In fact, we raised prices last October in the res market, and that price is pretty well stuck. Again, we raised on the back of commodity prices. We're actually seeing good pricing trend. And the inventory in the channel was really well going into the year, so some of this is restocking. But we're also seeing some good sell-through from distribution out to the field, so we have not seen much pricing pressure this year at Carrier.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Greg, could you talk about cash a little bit and where you're going? Could you kind of touch base on your line of sight to funding Goodrich? How do you feel today versus earlier in the year?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We feel really good, Howard. I think we've got line of sight to -- on the financing. We're looking at rates today and the 10-year treasury less than 2 looks pretty attractive. And I think the financing plan that we've laid out, we're not going to have any trouble in the marketplace, absent some big macro event. But that's why you have the bridge in place just in case. But I think we feel really good about the ability to place the debt and the rating, which we're going to be able to place that debt, so I feel very good. Cash in the quarter was strong. If you think about -- we have these couple of noncash gains. You need take those out, we're over 120% of free cash flow of net income. So the business continues to generate solid cash. Without share buyback, of course, the business' funding is really pretty robust. So I don't see any issue at all going to market here in the second quarter ahead of the deal to replace all this debt.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So have you brought the cash back from Europe yet or wherever to fund part of transaction, or is that TBD?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think all the cash movement will happen this part of the deal or towards the end of the years we'll use some of the international cash obviously from the IAE transactions as well, which is also scheduled to close mid-year. But a lot of moving pieces and you'll see us in the debt markets here shortly, well, at least, probably a few 3, 4 weeks ahead of whenever we think Goodrich is going to close. So I think that's all good news, and international cash flow, we'll access what we need to throughout the back half of the year.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then the other item, as I recall on the March 13 Analyst Day, Mr. Pino addressed the Canadian helicopter item as just a small software glitch and yet, we're still not seeing deliveries of that helicopter. Could you bring us up to date on where you are with that program, please?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, so the CMH, I think we're going to deliver 5 helicopters this year. We've got a couple of the interim configuration to deliver yet and then we'll actually have final configuration helicopters towards the end of the year. Of course, we'll deliver the bulk of those helicopters next year. The plan was always to deliver these things in the second half of the year. I think one may have slipped from June to July, but I think we're still on track on the interim version. And then the final version, the final software configuration version, we're still working that to get those out before the end of the year to meet the contractual commitment to the customers. So again we're on track. We're working with the customer all the time. The helicopter continues to perform well. It's a great helicopter. We have flight testing. No issues with the air frame. This really is just about the mission equipment, as Jeff talked about.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then just following on that, I mean, as you talked about readjusting the portfolio, in some cases you'll sell things like Rocketdyne, but then you're investing money in Eclipse. Can you sort of explain how you're making some of these portfolio decisions?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Can I make it very clear, we're not investing any more money in Eclipse. We bought -- we did make a small investment, less than $25 million in Eclipse really to service the aftermarket of the aircraft. I think there's about 300 of those airplanes that have been delivered. But we are not in the light jet business if you will. We're in the aftermarket business supporting the planes that are out there. But we're not in the manufacturing business for light jets. So again I think if that's -- we haven't made that clear before?", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "You made it crystal. It's crystal.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "You talked about the additional restructuring and onetime items. You mentioned Q2 that they're going to line up. Can you just talk about how those progressed through the year, if there's any other mismatches?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, what's really happened, that $0.21 of net good news that we saw in the first quarter, that will play out in the third and fourth quarter. A big chunk of that actually is going to be third quarter as we start to accrue some of the restructuring related to the Goodrich acquisition and the remainder will be in the fourth quarter. I can't give you an exact number today quarter-to-quarter -- third quarter versus fourth quarter, but as we get towards the end of the second quarter and we get to the close of Goodrich and we know exactly what the restructuring dollars are, we'll lay all that out for everybody.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and then on CCS you talked about the container move in the Europe. Has there been any improvement from this point forward just because I think that was the number for the year was about down 10% for container. Should we see growth in future quarters now?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think, again, the compares will get easier as we go throughout the year on containers, so we should see a little bit of improvement. I think, what, we were down low single digits, I guess, in terms of actual shipments in the quarter but down mid-teens in terms of the orders. So, again, we should see a little bit of an improvement as we go throughout the year.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right, and then just on the Pratt aftermarket, how much of that 5% growth is from the IAE joint venture versus the organic side of the business?", "Unknown Executive", "That's actually -- that's all organic. That does not include the IAE transaction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "I wanted to ask Coney had orders up 27% in the quarter versus you're down 10%. Greg, do you think that's all due to the mix issue you talked about in China, or is something else going on or haven't you looked at the numbers yet?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I just -- as we were coming down this morning I saw the Coney report come across the board. I haven't really had a chance to study or talk to the folks about it at Otis, but I think it's really -- it's to all those issues that we talked about with China in terms of the pricing, the mix that we saw over there. So I think again, we obviously lost a little bit of share. I think Coney had a pretty good quarter it looks like from an order perspective in China.", "George Shapiro", "Okay, and then just the book-to-bill at Hamilton and Pratt, I know you gave the spares in orders, but without knowing the exact numbers how were the book-to-bill numbers in the quarter?", "Unknown Executive", "Yes, at Pratt it was about 1.", "George Shapiro", "And Hamilton?", "Unknown Executive", "And Hamilton was slightly below 1.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It was a little over 1 -- less than 1.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "On Pratt and Hamilton, can you say what the spares did if you go sequentially from Q4?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I don't know if -- give us just a second. I think we can probably figure that out. So sequentially, spares sales were down mid-single-digits at Pratt, down about 5% sequentially. And sequentially I don't know that I have the -- I don't have the Hamilton numbers, so we can get back to you on that.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. Then if you just pull up, you said at the beginning that the results for the quarter were better than a little better than you had expected but there's a lot going on here. If you were to pull out the 2 or 3 things that you thought were clearly better for the quarter when you look at the whole year and the 2 or 3 that you would say did not come out as well, how -- what would you highlight?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think the things that you'd highlight naturally, of course, CCS. I think the res business there was better than what we had expected. I think the Hamilton business also, again, a little better than what we had expected, really a strong start to the year, so really solid organic revenue growth and good conversion with 15% profit growth. So I think those were both pleasant surprises. I'd also tell you even in CCS, the traction that we're getting on the restructuring there in the consolidation of the F&S business continue to pay dividends. So margins were strong, in CCS, I think you're going to continue to see that throughout the year. Yes, on the downside, there's just a lot of stuff going on. Obviously, China was a bit of a surprise although it was really -- we've talked about it back in March we knew it's going to be soft in China. Sikorsky, a little bit weaker than we expected, but again that's just timing. I think they missed 5 helicopters at the very end of the quarter due to a small supplier quality issue. Those helicopters have all shipped, so not really any bad news at Sikorsky and I think at Pratt, things continue on track. We're -- development engineering is up but it's up in line with expectations. We continue to make good progress there so, this is very atypical for UTC given all of the moving pieces here. We've got acquisitions. We've got divestitures. We've got markets that are a little bit choppy. But I think long-term, we're doing the right things from a portfolio standpoint, aligning the portfolio with where we want to be with the growth markets, and it's going to be a tough year this year but I think it will be a solid year. We're going to be able to deliver on the commitments.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And then lastly, when you look at China in both from an Otis standpoint and from a Carrier standpoint, and you see shifts in expectations for commercial construction growth there, how do you approach that? In other words, what changes do you make to those businesses operationally when you're looking at different types of outlooks?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, that's a great question. In fact one of the things that we've done in China is actually realign the geographies from a leadership standpoint. China, as part of Otis, used to be part of the North Asian operation under Charles Vaux [ph]. Charles is retired, and then we've brought in Thomas Vining to take over China as a stand-alone region. And the recent we've done that is because the aftermarket opportunity remains the single biggest opportunity across the Otis business for future profit growth. It's only 7% of the business in China today. We think within a few years, it's going to get back up towards a more normal 50%-50% kind of business. A few years might be 10 years, but really the focus is going to be on growing the aftermarket when you see moderating growth as we see today on the commercial construction side. So long-term focus there is to grow the aftermarket. I think Pedro talked about that in March, and you're going to hear us continue to talk about that in the coming months in orders as the real focus of the business is to grow the aftermarket. Quite frankly, that's where the beauty of Otis is, is in that 1.8 million elevators and service around the world every day. It's that annuity. It's a wonderful thing, and we need to grow it in China.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "But it sounds like what you're saying is that when you see quarterly or 6-month changes in outlooks for China, that doesn't cause you to react very much in terms of your China strategy and your operational approach.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No I think, again, the focus is still going to continue to be on China. And we continue to do the right things for the long term. As I said, we're opening up this new factory in Chongqing with a low-cost Gen2 elevator, and we continue to make investments in China, and China's going to be a growth market for years to come. The urbanization trends that -- they aren't in a onetime thing and again, we've seen this thing play out before where you see quarter-to-quarter you'll see ups and downs in China. But a couple of quarters of China being down doesn't dissuade us from the opportunity that's there.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Deane Dray from Citigroup.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I know we touched on this on Carrier residential, but the idea here is that you've got this big surge of orders the last 2 weeks of March and a number of OEs have reported seeing the exact same thing. So it's really important if we could some color regarding how that transitioned into April, because that way we get a better sanction about is this real demand coming back, or these dealer incentives? But any color regarding the demand you've seen so far in April would be helpful.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I can't -- I'm not going to give you weekly order trends. I know you look at this every week, but I would tell you the season is up to very good start and the strength that we saw at the end of March has continued into April a little bit slower rate than, March but still pretty strong as we move into April here.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Do you run any risk of components shortages, because if you do get that perfect storm and you do get a resurgence in demand, supplies inventories are really lean here, including compressors. Is there an issue where you might get some inventory stockouts or is that -- you don't expect that is a scenario?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "In fact, I asked Geraud that same question a week ago as we saw this surge in orders. It's a short cycle business, and we see this all the time. But I know that Geraud and the Carrier folks have been working with all the suppliers. I know that they've been working with Emerson to make sure there's adequate supplier compressors, and we have not seen any shortages so far, although, again, we're -- something to keep an eye on as these trends continue. Again, we've got the capacity in our factories to do -- to ramp up pretty quickly and I believe also the supply base does as well.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then the last one is within the resi orders that you received, has it been skewed towards the lower price point entry level, 13s here, or has there been any step up in terms of the higher price points?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I haven't really seen any skew. I think, again, last year, we saw a big -- last couple of years, we've seen kind of down and dirty where everything is entry level, SEER 13. Orders look to be pretty good in the quarters. We got a little bit better news there, including some of the, I think, the R228s, the shipments were kind of in line with the market still. So yes, that don't see any big macro change there in terms of the buying patterns. ", "Thank you so much. All right, everyone, thanks. So to start the year is a little bit better than we expected. We're confident of our full year outlook. Of course, we're positioning the company for earnings growth both this year and beyond as we continue our focus on cost reduction and the transformational changes to the portfolio, as well as the continued investments in these game-changing technologies. Thanks for listening today. We look forward to seeing you throughout the remainder of the year. Maria [ph] and team will be available for calls throughout the day, so thanks very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

On the call today are Louis Chenevert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and onetime items as they usually do.", "The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "[Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Mr. Chenevert.", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Well, thank you very much, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be part of the call on this historic moment for our company. We've had a full week with many exciting developments. Greg will take you through the quarter results in just a moment. But first, let me start with an update on our major acquisitions and on our business transformation strategy.", "Late last month, we closed on the IAE transaction and this morning we received the final regulatory approvals for the Goodrich acquisition. We anticipate closing later today or early tomorrow morning. These are transformational deals for UTC, setting the stage for strong earnings momentum. IAE brings tremendous aftermarket runway with the V2500, which now represents Pratt & Whitney's largest install fleet. There are over 4,500 V2500 engines in service with an average age of only 7 years, and we expect to deliver another 3,000 engines in the future. The IAE transaction further validates our game-changing GTF technology and strengthens our relationship with nearly 200 airline customers around the world, ensuring a seamless transition from the V2500 to the GTF-powered A320neo.", "Turning to Goodrich. I'm very pleased we will close such a large transaction in just 10 months with limited required divestitures. Goodrich adds a very strong portfolio of complementary products and is a great fit with Hamilton Sundstrand. Bringing these 2 companies together will significantly strengthen our position in the growing aerospace segment and will allow us to develop more integrated systems for our customers and win greater content on next-generation aircraft. Since announcing the agreement, we have done significant integration planning. So we are ready to begin integrating Goodrich into our Propulsion and Aerospace systems organization. A team of more than 50 employees has worked relentlessly on integration planning with hundreds of employees lending additional support. The leadership team is in place and our extensive planning activities will make for a smooth transition for our customers, suppliers and employees.", "Our large transactions, culture and people are key to success and I'm very happy with everything I see at this point. We have already identified all of the $400 million of run rate synergies that we expect to achieve by year 5, and leadership is looking up more. I am confident that Alain and the team will identify additional synergies as they work through the integration process.", "We've completed the financing for Goodrich with a structure that was much better than originally expected. We issued the largest U.S. corporate bond offering since 2009, $9.8 billion at an average interest rate of less than 3%. We listen to our shareholders and we reduced our original need for equity issuance from $4 billion down to $1.1 billion of mandatory convertible units. We expect to pay down about 1/3 of the total [ph] purchase price by the end of 2012, using that proceeds from previously announced divestitures and cash from operations.", "We have made great progress on the divestitures. We reached agreement to sell both Hamilton Sundstrand Industrial's business and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne this week. These are strong profitable businesses but we are streamlining the UTC portfolio to focus on our core of commercial building systems and aerospace.", "In the second quarter, we classified another non-core asset, our fuel cell business, as held up for sale. And we continue to expect to complete the divestiture of Clipper imminently. As expected, during the regulatory process for Goodrich, we agreed to divest businesses totaling about $250 million of annual sales, including Goodrich's electric power systems business, pumps and engine control business. These are attractive businesses with great employees so we expect a robust auction process. We also agreed to sell Goodrich interest into the air engine control original equipment joint venture for Rolls Royce.", "Let me sum up by saying, great progress on transformational changes that will generate real-long term value for our shareholders. This team is executing in a superb way.", "Before I turn it over to Greg to take you through the second-quarter results, just a few comments on the year. It is certainly a challenging environment out there, with a slowing global economy, the euro trading near 1.2 and the late July close for Goodrich. Therefore, we are rebaselining our expectations for the year. We now expect sales of $58 billion to $59 billion, $3 billion lower than our prior expectation and earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35 versus our prior expectation of $5.30 to $5.50 with FX and the late July close of Goodrich accounting for about $0.15 of additional headwind.", "Now we know how to operate in a tough macroeconomic environment at UTC, and we are increasing our investment in restructuring this year to $500 million, up from $450 million. As always, we'll remain focused on what we control in the back half of the year, cost reductions, strong execution, investment in game-changing technology and the seamless integration of Goodrich and IAE into the UTC portfolio.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thanks, Louis. We're now on Slide 2 on the webcast. As you saw on the press release this morning, second-quarter earnings per share was up 15% year-over-year to $1.62. That included a benefit from a lower tax rate. Our tax rate in the quarter came in at 22.5%, primarily due to the timing of some legal entity reorganizations. Before one-timers, the tax rate contributed a $0.13 benefit versus our full-year expected tax rate of 29.5%.", "In the quarter, we also faced $0.11 per share of headwind from higher pension costs, E&D investment and FX. But despite these headwinds, segment operating margin expanded 80 basis points, with Climate, Controls & Security leading the way with 230 basis points of margin expansion, evidence that we continue to focus on execution and cost control in this difficult economic environment.", "UTC's organic sales growth of 1% reflects slowing sales in Europe, China and the commercial Aerospace aftermarket. There's clearly uncertainty out there. Europe continues to struggle with the debt crisis with no clear solution in place. Most indicators now point to a very modest growth in the U.S. this year with this looming fiscal cliff at the end of this year, which could further dampen growth prospects for next year. As we all know, China and India are also faced with slowing growth. China's reported second-quarter GDP slowed to 7.6%. That's still of course pretty strong but the lowest level we've seen since early 2009. We do know that the Chinese government is taking steps to stimulate the economy, including a second interest rate cut, but the government remains concerned about high property prices.", "And despite this near-term slowdown, the urbanization trends and the long-term fundamentals are still in place in the emerging markets, and especially in China and in the central and western provinces. We have confidence in the long-term growth prospects of all these emerging markets.", "Against this economic backdrop, though, we are lowering our second-half growth expectations for Otis, CCS and Pratt & Whitney. We're also lowering our expectations for the euro to a new U.S. dollar to euro rate of 1.20. This represents an additional $135 million of earnings headwind to our original guidance where we pegged the euro at 1.35 to the dollar. As Louis said, we continue to focus on what we control in the face of these challenges. So in the first half of the year, we invested $204 million in restructuring, with $93 million in the second quarter. The businesses continue to find way to reduce structural costs and we're once again taking up our estimates for restructuring for the year to $500 million, which will include Goodrich-related actions. That's up $50 million from our previous guidance.", "As a result of the headwinds and changes we've discussed, we now expect sales of $58 billion to $59 billion, as Louis said, with organic growth of 0% to 2% versus our prior expectation of organic growth of 2% to 4%. We expect earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35, of course, it's down from our previous guidance of $5.30 to $5.50. This guidance includes $3.6 billion of sales and a net $0.30 EPS dilution from the Goodrich acquisition. That's lower than our previous guidance of $4.5 billion of sales and $0.25 of net dilution, respectively. These changes are simply due to the late July close, which is a month later than we originally built into our plan.", "So still a lot of moving parts, such as accounting conformity and amortization around the Goodrich deal and we'll be back to update you if necessary later in the quarter, but we don't anticipate any big changes at this point.", "On Slide 3 now. Few more points in the quarter. Total sales were down 5% due to the impact of FX and net divestitures. Of note, Hamilton Sundstrand delivered another strong quarter with 9% organic growth on strength of both commercial and military aerospace. Earnings per share of $1.62 include $0.10 of net one-time gains, that's from the ongoing transformation at CCS. That was more than offset $0.06 of restructuring. Excluding restructuring and net one-time items in both years, EPS increased 13%. FX had a negative impact for the quarter of $0.05. As you know, we completed most of the financing for the Goodrich acquisition in early June. Interest expense and transaction costs related to the acquisition were $0.04 in the quarter. And free cash flow was 99% of net income. UTC continues to deliver strong, consistent cash flow and we're confident we'll deliver free cash flow equal to or in excess of net income for the year.", "Order trends, now on Slide 4. As you can see, in this chart, CCS's North American Residential HVAC orders were up 4% in the quarter, which is in line with our full-year expectations. At Otis, new equipment orders were down 4% at constant currency, including China, which contracted 13%. But we did see improving trends late in the quarter as the initiatives the Otis team implemented have started to gain traction.", "Pratt & Whitney's large commercial engine spare orders were down 15% for the quarter and Hamilton Sundstrand's commercial spares were down 10%. Although RPM's [indiscernible] passenger miles are increasing and load factors remain high, airlines continue to conserve cash and limit their spending on spares. Average sales per shop visit versus the prior year have dropped about $300,000 or $400,000 and we now expect Pratt & Whitney's commercial spares to be down about 10% organically this year versus our prior expectation of 5% growth.", "So a solid second quarter with good execution in the business in a tough macro economic environment. I'll come back and talk a little bit more about the full year at the end, but let me turn it over to Jay to take you to the business unit results.", "Jesus Malave", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 5. At Otis, operating profit was down 8% in the quarter and a 5% decline at sales with foreign currency translation, reducing both sales and profit growth by 5 percentage points. Operating margin was 22.7%, 70 basis points lower than prior year. At constant currency, new equipment sales were down low single digit with high single-digit sales growth in North America, more than offset by declines in Europe and China. Although China new equipment sales were down low single digit in the quarter, the rate of decline improved from the previous quarter.", "Overall service sales were up, led by growth in modernization and contractual maintenance. Aggressive cost reduction actions partially offset the impact of higher commodity costs and continued pricing pressure mostly in Europe. At constant currency, new equipment orders were down 4%, with North America up double digits, Europe flattish and China down 13%. Thanks to enhanced communication and brand awareness efforts in China, Otis is beginning to stem the decline in new equipment orders and saw a solid growth in June. A much weaker euro, combined with the continued economic slowdown in Europe and soft new equipment volumes in China are putting pressure on Otis' profit growth. For the year, we now expect Otis sales to be down mid-single digit from up mid-single digit and profits to be down $175 million to $225 million compared to the previous guidance of up $50 million to $75 million. This guidance includes $175 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation versus $75 million previously, assuming a euro average of 1.20 for the balance of the year. Otis increased its restructuring efforts to reduce costs and continue making structural changes to position the business for future profit growth.", "On Slide 6. UTC Climate, Controls & Security margins were up sharply to 15.7%, an increase of 230 basis points from prior year as profits increased 4% in the quarter on 11% lower sales. Organic sales were flat following 9% growth in the second quarter of last year. Organic growth was up mid-single digit in each of the America's residential and commercial HVAC businesses and flattish in Europe, Asia and the automation and controls businesses. Transicold was down double digits organically.", "Profit growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digit overall but down low double digits in Europe. Transicold orders were down around 25% and Global Fire & Security products were down low single digit.", "While CCS first-half earnings were in line with expectations, full-year guidance is being revised to growth of about $150 million from up $225 million to reflect increased FX headwind and weaker organic growth of around 2% due to softer end markets. When combined with the impact of divestitures and FX headwind, we expect reported sales to be down about 7%. Margin expansion will be strong, up about 180 basis points from productivity, cost reduction and the benefit from portfolio transformation.", "Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 5% in the second quarter including one point of unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Higher sales were driven by growth in the military and Pratt Canada businesses, partially offset by lower commercial aftermarket and lower industrial shipments at Power Systems. Large commercial spares were down 13% year-over-year, including the benefit from sales to third-party aftermarket parts companies.", "Operating profit in the quarter was down 1%. Higher E&D, pension costs and lower commercial spares were partially offset by the benefit of higher military and Pratt Canada sales, restructuring savings and a gain from the sale of equity position in a commercial aftermarket venture of about $0.02 per share.", "Commercial spares book-to-bill for the quarter was slightly below 1. As Greg stated, craft's conservation at airlines has impacted order rates and we now expect commercial spares to be down 10% organically versus up mid-single digits previously. As a result of the lower commercial spares outlook, Pratt's operating profit is now likely to be down $100 million to $125 million for the year as compared with down $25 million to $50 million previously. We now expect sales to be up mid-single digits versus prior expectations of about high single digits.", "Hamilton Sundstrand delivered a solid quarter with profit growth of 14% on 7% higher sales. OEM sales were up mid-teens while aftermarket was flattish. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by a strong conversion and OEM growth and favorable mix. Operating margin was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 17.1%. Overall, commercial spares sales orders were down 10% year-over-year with declines in both parts and provisioning. Book-to-bill was below 1. For the full year, we continue to expect operating profit for the base business to be up $75 million to $100 million and sales up high single digit. We'll provide an update later in the year on total UTC aerospace systems guidance.", "Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 9. Operating profit grew 5% on 9% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 51 aircraft, 44 aircraft were based on military platforms and 7 commercial. Lower sales were driven by 19 fewer aircraft deliveries, primarily lower U.S. government and international military deliveries. Mid-teens growth in aftermarket sales partially offset the impact of lower aircraft volumes. On profit, strong performance in aftermarket, favorable mix of commercial aircraft deliveries, including the absence of 1 Canadian Maritime Helicopter, offset the impact of the lower military aircraft deliveries. Productivity and restructuring benefits across the enterprise also contributed towards our second-quarter operating profit growth. For the full year, we continue to expect profit growth of $50 million to $75 million on a mid-single-digit sales decline.", "With that, let me turn it back to Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks, Jay. As I said earlier, these are really solid results in a very, very tough economic environment. Let me just talk about a few highlights in the quarter, just to add to some of the others we've already talked about. Pratt & Whitney secured an additional 410 orders for our GTF engine family at the Farnborough Air Show, including a SkyWest order for 200 Mitsubishi Regional Jet Engines. And we now have over 2,900 firm and option engine orders across the 4 GTF platforms.", "We've also completed over 3,000 hours of testing and concluded the flight test program for the both CSeries and MRJ engine. We continue to expect the CSeries engine will achieve certification in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Sikorsky signed a Multi-Year 8 contract in early July with the U.S. government. The contract calls for the production approximately 650 Blackhawk and Seahawk helicopters, including foreign military sales, and that is valued at about $8.5 billion through 2017.", "On the commercial side of the business, Geraud and the team are progressing well with the integration of our new CCS organization. The combined impact of portfolio and operational transformation, along with the synergies from the integration, contributed to a record operating margin of 15.7% in the second quarter.", "As far as the 2012 outlook, as we mentioned before, we're going to see earnings this year somewhere between $5.25 and $5.35 on sales of $58 billion to $59 billion. As for other elements of the guidance, while the timing of certain transactions reduced the effect of tax rate in the first half of the year, we continue to expect an operational tax rate of 29.5% for the base business for the full year 2012. And what that means is in the third and fourth quarter, we'll see an effective tax rate of about 32%. As I mentioned, we expect to invest about $500 million in restructuring, including Goodrich. That'll be more than offset by about $600 million of gains and other onetime items.", "We'll come back and update you once we have more access to Goodrich, including our expectations for the new United Technologies aerospace systems segment.", "And with that, let's stop and open up the call for questions. Stephanie?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Our first question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Could you -- just going up to 30,000 feet here, take us maybe on a -- from a walk -- from your old EPS guidance to your new. Middle of the range, you've gone from $5.40 to $5.30, but the operational things you're laying out there, it's looks like around $400 million of pressure in the segments and then the higher restructuring looks like a bigger impact. So could you give us a bridge and then where you are in terms of a contingency at your new number.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, okay, Joe. There are a lot of moving pieces here. So I'll try and go through this as succinctly as possible. So you think about -- we had a prior guidance of $5.40 and that concluded a contingency of about $200 million or $0.15. As we look at what's happened in the business is, we've taken about $0.20 of operating segment profit away. About half of that's at Otis as we've reduced new equipment and service sales down about $600 million of sales. The other half of the operational downward pressure is at Pratt and CCS. Pratt's down about $0.06 and CCS is down about $0.04. This is just the operational piece. The next piece, of course, is FX, which is another $0.10 of the takedown. On top of that now, you add in Goodrich about a $0.05 impact from the 1-month delay in closing, about $0.04 from additional restructuring. We also picked up about $0.04 as we moved UT Power to discontinued ops. We picked up another $0.10 with eliminations and other and some minority interest changes down below the line, so we've used up the contingency and at the midpoint of the new guidance, I would say, we don't have any contingency. That's why we really have the lower end at $5.25. Now we think again, we properly calibrated each of the businesses with these new guides, but there still is risk out there in the back half of the year. And again, I think we've also been conservative on the year at 1.20 -- and it's at 1.22, 1.23 today, hopefully, we'll get some lift out of that, which might add some contingency. But it's a little early to tell.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Could you walk through the pluses are, the $0.04 and the $0.10, because that's where I was really getting at -- was -- what's the kind of offsetting all this other pressure?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, so if you think about CCS, I mean, we're taking sales down about $400 million operationally and earnings down about $100 million. You've got a benefit though offsetting that of about $50 million related to commodities and really that's just a takedown in sales in Asia where we used to think we'd see about mid-single-digit growth -- I'm sorry, high-single digit, now it's mid-single digit. Transicold, because of the order rates we've seen in the second quarter, has gone from down high-single digits to probably down near 10% and the F&S product lines are going to be up low single from mid single. So you add all that up, you'll get about $400 million of takedown in sales and $100 million of EBIT and then there's $50 million of offset for the net commodities. On the Pratt side, it's a little bit more complicated, but really it's about -- spares are going to be down about $350 million from what we've previously estimated. There's a couple of -- and on top of that, service will be down a little bit, so Pratt's sales will actually be down about $500 million, and there is about $200 million of earnings associated with that. Offsetting that, you've got restructuring savings of about $25 million. IAE will add about $50 million, it's a little better than what we had expected just because of some of the timing. And also E&D will be down about $50 million. Now some of these programs have moved to the right. So net-net, about $75 million of takedown at Pratt and about $50 million of takedown at CCS.", "Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. Just -- second question, just digging into Otis. The margins took a -- improved a bit since some of the trends improved a bit sequentially from Q1 to Q2. What's -- as we look towards the rest of the year and into the margin pressure we really saw on Q1, do you feel like you've really gotten your arms around, I guess, the pricing pressure you are facing in Europe? I don't know if this labor inflation played a role in the service business? What can we expect there going forward?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So yes, on top of the -- just the overall weakness that we've seen in sales, we have -- we are seeing some continued pricing pressure. If you think about the margin, it was down 70 basis points in the second quarter after being down 100 basis points in the first quarter, about 30 basis points of that takedown was related to the pricing, another 40 basis points was related to commodity. It's mostly rare earth. Going forward to the back half of the year we've got about $75 million of additional headwind from pricing in the current guidance. So on top of sales being down about $500 million, you've got another $75 million of bad news from pricing. And commodities give you a little bit of a benefit. Restructuring gives you a little bit of benefit. But overall, you're going to be down somewhere around $260 million or so from previous guidance with FX of $100 million.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Your Carrier and old Fire & Security business delivered terrific numbers in the quarter, Greg. Could you for a moment sort of talk about some of the successes that Geraud has been able to accomplish. It looks like some of them are coming through a little quicker than I would've anticipated.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think the integration of the CCS -- I'm sorry, CCS between Carrier and Fire & Security is going probably better than what we had originally anticipated. It's really just a tribute  to Geraud and the team. They've been able to take out a lot more cost, a lot more quickly than what we had anticipated. But I think more importantly, they've been able to stabilize some of the other businesses at F&S where we saw issues last year, especially in Europe. We're not getting much traction on the top line with the F&S businesses. But the bottom line is getting better as there's more discipline around pricing, more discipline around the contracts that we're taking. So a lot of the bad news that we saw last year, bad news, surprises coming out of the U.K., for instance, again, sales aren't up in the U.K. but profits are now on the legacy F&S business just because of the discipline I think that Geraud and the management team has brought to the pricing process there.", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Maybe, Howard, if I could add, I think we're seeing the benefits of a very seasoned team that did profound transformation at Carrier before that, exercising their leadership skills with the F&S business and like the backlog in the U.K. is getting much better, I mean, much better margin on that backlog as we go forward. So Geraud is doing a superb job at leveraging all the best practices and implementing quickly across the board and he knows how to do transformation and he's executing very well.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one follow-up one -- I can't resist on Sikorsky a little bit and talk a little bit about the Canadian Maritime helicopter. Sorry to do that. But it does look like it slipped again to the right. And how are you sort of accommodating or coming up with a solution that will, maybe, help out your numbers?", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Yes. Well, let me take that, Howard. First of all, the CMH program, I have to say, is the best maritime helicopter in the world. And it's basically ready to fly and we have made incredible progress. We're also working very closely with the customer to make sure that they get the product they're looking for, that it's a win-win. And I would say Mick Maurer and the team have at Sikorsky are aggressively working to make sure we deliver these helicopters and minimizing the impact of the business. Now what's very encouraging, just a heads up, is we saw some high interest at the Farnborough Air Show this year. This is the second air show, Paris was the same last year. We saw outside customers show interest in the platform as is. And we saw this interest renewed again this year by a couple countries. And in my view, while it's been a painful experience to this point, as we move forward and deliver these 28 helicopters. In my view, there's potential to deliver basically many, many new helicopters of the same configuration that we've now developed, we have. And it's all about working with the Canadian government now to make sure that we close on all the issues. So you need both parties, basically, to agree on tackling the issues. And I would say we're making substantial progress. Obviously, there's been some key deadlines that we had hoped meet and basically, at this point in time, both sides are working to make sure they ultimately get the helicopter that they badly need to replace their aging fleet.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Just a follow-up to Louis's comments. We are still -- we have in the forecast this year for Sikorsky to ship 5 CMH. Right now, as Louis said, we're still negotiating with the Canadians around the final configuration of what those aircraft are going to be and we still plan to ship those 5 this year. But obviously, if those slip into next year, it gives us a little more headwind. I think there's nothing to do in terms of next year's issue around delivering the 19 helicopters financially until we resolve the contractual and configuration issues. But we clearly have an eye towards that, Howard, to see what we can do to help offset some of that what will be a pretty big headwind at Sikorsky next year.", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Just to close on this, Howard. We have, I think, a path to success that's developing. And in the upcoming webcast in the month of September, we should be able to give better color and update as to the progress we are making there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Douglas Harned from Sanford Bernstein.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I wanted to go back to CC&S. If you could describe a little bit more about the actions that have been taken. You talked about more discipline with respect to pricing in Fire & Security. But I'm trying to understand, the margins were very impressive. If you go across the subsegments within CC&S, where you saw the most success and what steps were taken? Were these organizational changes? Were there headcount reductions, facilities consolidation? What actions are taking place there?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We talk a lot about CCS and the Carrier portfolio rationalization or reorganization that Geraud and team have been undertaking in the last few years. And some of that same magic I think you see that happening with the F&S portfolio. We did divest a couple of F&S businesses in the quarter, which helped margin a little bit. But I think importantly, at Carrier, CCS has been the operational transformation. What they've been able to do in the factories, continuing to implement the ACE operating systems, taking overhead out. And we've talked about what a great work they've done in Collierville, Tennessee with the lines there to reduce overhead, the breakeven point in the factory. But also, think about all the restructuring that's been done. We've moved a lot of work down to Monterey, and that's been very, very successful, transforming the commercial product lines. We've invested a lot in R&D. Again, I think we've got better products today, we're much more energy efficient and we're getting good pricing in the market for these new products. So I'd say it's a combination of portfolio, cost discipline, factory performance and product investment, all those things together have really contributed to this margin expansion that we're seeing. And, yet, for the full year, and Jay mentioned it earlier, we're probably going to get 180 basis points of margin expansion. We're talking about close to 14% margins this year, which was Geraud's goal for a year from now. So again, I think they're making great progress and a doing lot faster than any of us anticipated.", "Louis R. Chenevert", "And remember, the skill set was much more advanced at Carrier on the ACE discipline supply chain development. And by creating CCS, they've been able to leverage that skill set into what's the old Fire & Security that was really the last one to make progress on ACE and supply chain. So we've kind of jump-started these initiatives and we're seeing the good impact of the leadership being focused but also having done it before.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Well, if I think back a few years ago, George David often talked about a goal of 15% margins at Carrier and that seemed far off. I mean, are you -- is that a possibility here in the reasonable future?", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Well, as you know, it's my job always to stretch with big goals and impose on BUs, basically stretch targets and then they happily go deliver. And that culture is untouched at UTC. That's the way I run the business. And I think we're well on track with proving, basically, that we're going to deliver on these big goals.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think that what you may be -- you might think of, Doug, is, from a top-line standpoint, Geraud and team are going to deliver what will be close to 14% margins at organic growth of only about 2% this year. I think once we start to see some traction in the end markets, I think, obviously, there's got to be upside and Carrier demonstrated that back in 2010 when the markets came back and we got great operating leverage. So again, I think there is runway here at the end of the day.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Just wondering on a couple of things on Goodrich. How much of the incremental restructuring is at Goodrich? And does the timing change or business trends that you're seeing in aero aftermarket kind of change your view on what the accretion outlook is for 2013?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think, again, as we look at the combined Hamilton and Goodrich businesses, we're really pretty much on track to what we had expected for the full year this year. Nothing really out there that would tell us that there's going to be any the big impact or longer-term impact on the commercial aftermarket. I think Goodrich's second quarter, their aftermarket was up a little bit, which is better than what we even saw at Hamilton. So financially, I don't see an issue there. The restructuring, it's about $150 million roughly of restructuring we'll do this year. And that's -- some at legacy Goodrich and some at the legacy Hamilton businesses. So as we combine the headquarters down in Charlotte, there'll be some costs we'll be incurring up here in Connecticut. We're also, of course, looking at some rationalization. We'll take out the public company costs and all that. But I think Alain and the team have a clear line of sight to that $150 million this year and there will be more next year as we get into this. But I think the accretion number that we laid out, which is $0.50 to $0.55 next year from the Goodrich acquisition is still right about what we expected it. Again, I think interest costs are a little bit better. Obviously, you don't have any issue. A lot less equity makes that number a little bit better as well. So we're really on track, I think, financially on the Goodrich transaction as we enter day 1 here.", "Louis R. Chenevert", "And maybe to add, everything I thought this deal was when I announced it last September, I would say it's all of that or better today. I mean, the talent that's in there, the opportunities, the synergies, the customer response, the partner response, all good. So I'm very, very happy with closing such a large transaction in such a short period, and everything we mapped out up front got better.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And I was wondering, just changing gears in the second question, the comment on Otis, June, China looked better, maybe not trying to overanalyze a month. But do you, in fact, kind of see and feel a real inflection and just kind of the tone of business there, whether it's -- what's going on competitively or how the government relations and the like are playing out and what do you think about the back half? Obviously, you gave your guidance, but just kind of the commercial success of Otis looking into the back half.", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Well, first of all, Otis a very strong franchise, as you know, with a great brand recognition. And I would say that the profound changes we have done in China, as far as leadership structure, reporting line, have had a good impact with the customer base and with the results. Certainly, as we went through the second quarter, we made a change with the President of Otis China now reporting to the President of Otis, Pedro Baranda. We also created a business development office that's now located in Shanghai. And remember, about a year ago, we had announced also the high-rise center of excellence was now in Shanghai. So there's a great team now in China that's complete, that is driving momentum, with the dealers, driving momentum with -- we adjusted the price as we declared earlier to reflect the realities of the competitive landscape, that's after the rare earth increase we did last year. And obviously, as the months have gone by, we're starting to see that the penalty that was in front of us with government opportunities has disappeared and basically, we are now bidding on the opportunities like the next tranche, [ph] Beijing Metro, et cetera. So I would say Pedro and the team -- Pedro has been to China twice in the last 6 weeks. I'm going to be with him at the September Chongqing's Mayor's Conference. We're going to opening the new factory in Chongqing that is going to be serving the Central and West regions. As you know, there's also been a big shift in mix from the basically traditional mix to more low-cost housing, where perhaps Otis had a bit of weakness. But now with the new factory, with the new product line and everything we put in place, basically, we feel very good that we have a guidance that Pedro can achieve going forward and more importantly resume our share position in that market. I think it's all coming together. And as a matter of fact, as we said, I mean, it's 1 month, but I would say, we continue to see similar momentum. June was a record month of sales for Otis in China, following a couple of very difficult months. July is off to a reasonable start. So I mean, it's early in Q3 and I'm not going to give details. But I would say, everything we've done as we monitor, and I'll be there personally later on in September, I would say it's coming together and Otis is a strong franchise and will deliver on its promises to its customer and shareholders.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the aftermarket. Greg, I wondered if you might speak to differences in trends you might be seeing in wide-body versus narrow-body or even in spares versus MRO at Pratt.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think it's very platform-specific as we look at the Pratt issues in the aftermarket. I think what we have seen is -- actually, shop visits are now look to be coming down in the back half of the year from what we expected. And that's really primarily related to some of the actions that Delta and some of the others are taking at the legacy 757 fleet, where we're seeing planes parked and their engines parted out. So again, I think airlines are very focused on cost containment and the 757 fleet obviously is Pratt-powered primarily, we're seeing a bigger impact from that. The other piece that I guess catches us a little by surprise but probably shouldn't have is on the V2500. Again, to Louis's point, we've got 4,500 engines out there in service today. About 5 years ago, we put in an upgrade called the select program. And that's actually extended the time on wing about 2,000 to 3,000 hours. So some of the V2500 overhauls that we had expected this year are getting pushed into next year. So it's not just one thing. I think you've got a few retirements of 757s. You got better on-wing performance on the Vs and then you've got the 4000, which again we did a lot of work a couple of years ago, and they're also staying on-wing longer. So cash conservation by the airlines, better on-wing performances and some retirements, all that kind of added up to what we see for the aftermarket this year at Pratt now.", "Louis R. Chenevert", "And Carter, a little -- other comment, which is showing the signs of the airline are cautious as they shop content per visit perhaps reflect some of that. They don't book the full content that we would expect them to book, which means there's going to be shop visit sooner in the future because of that. And overall, I'm very pleased, as you know, with the IAE transaction. While it doesn't always get the spotlight, I think, as much as it should, it's a huge transformational deal. It's a large install base for Pratt with a big backlog. And those planes are flying. It's a young fleet. It's going to be around for a long time. And I think that has a very positive impact on Pratt aftermarket business for a long time to come.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And just as a second question, like Jeff, I don't want to get too hung up on single months. But you called out that the residential HVAC orders were up 4, how did that trend over the quarter and can you speak to what you're seeing in June?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "June or July?", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "July, excuse me.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think -- as you think about it, it's been very lumpy year on the resi side here in the U.S. We started out and had a very slow first 2 months of the year and then a very, very strong March. And we ended March with great momentum. We saw orders up and then slowed down again in April, slowed down in May. And then with all of the heat across the U.S., we had a very, very strong June. And that continued into the first part of July here. Again, not surprising, when you look at the temperatures across the U.S., we've had a very, very good cooling season from that respect. So again, I think we're still expecting kind of 4% to 5% growth in res for the year. Could it be better? I think it will depend really upon the weather and restocking. Right now, channel inventories look to be about normal for this time of year. We're seeing good sellthrough from distribution. So I think it's -- there might be upside, but it's really too early to call on, and I think we're properly calibrated on that. And the other thing, of course, you've got to remember there's still the heating season in front of us when last year at the legacy Carrier business, there really was no heating business because of the very, very warm weather we had throughout the fall and early winter last year. So it's too early to call, but I'd say right now, we're cautiously optimistic on the market for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Terry Darling from Goldman Sachs.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just probably a couple of follow-ups here. First, on the aftermarket, I'm wondering, from a timing perspective, number of the items that you called out here sort of seem transient in nature but could continue for a couple of quarters, obviously reflected in your guidance. Thinking about 2013, do you see bounce back there? Is it just purely contingent on where the demand in the market is, or how do you think about the aftermarket growth as you move into 2013?", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Terry, I guess it's way too early to give guidance on 2013. But let me give you just maybe a bit of color. Our goal is to grow earnings double digit year after year and we know the formula. I mean, it's probably a third organic growth, it's a third margin expansion and I think the track record of this team on margin expansion speaks for itself. And then the other third is how we deploy capital. So I mean, there's no doubt that with the changes we've done, with the transformational acquisition, we have some good momentum. And we will expect solid accretion from the Goodrich and IAE transaction next year and I think the game plan is in place. We're working to mitigate some of the headwinds like CMH but at the same time we have a great backlog, for example, on S-92, the backlog is at a record of $1.4 billion. So there's a lot of moving parts. This team is enthused, energized and stay tuned and I think we'll deliver UTC stellar results as we go forward.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I'll just add. In terms of the aftermarket, one of the things that obviously drives airline behavior is oil prices. We have seen oil prices come down about 20% in the last 3 months. That takes about 6 months to find its way through in terms of ordering patterns at the airlines. The shop business, which were light -- we saw this back in 2010. Louis has always talked about the walls, [ph] spares, and spares over time are going to be there. I guess it's just a question of timing. So I can't tell you whether that's third or fourth quarter this year. Obviously, we think it's not going to happen. We'll see it at some point, but it is -- to Louis's point, way too early to think about what spares outlook is going to look like. The world is pretty dynamic given everything that's going on. But again, I think airlines are flying, flying the planes full. We've got a big fleet of V2500s out there. We've got a good fleet of legacy Pratt products, so spares will come back. I think it's just a matter of timing to your first point.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And I appreciate we are a long way away from 2013 guidance. But Louis, it doesn't sound like you see anything out there with regards to the ability to grow double digit at this point that you'd want to highlight for us. I guess the question is, in that context, 1/3 from capital allocation, are you thinking the Goodrich accretion, in that mix, in other words, do you think that organically, double-digit growth is possible?", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Well, you heard what I said before, and it's way too early to give guidance, but this is the culture of this company, to drive double-digit earnings growth and that's what we're focused on, I think we have the pieces coming together. Stay tuned.", "Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then maybe just lastly, non-res construction in the U.S. doesn't sound like you really changed your outlook there, bunch of data points on both the positive and the negative side from other players. How are you seeing that market at this point in and around that mid-single digit kind of longer term outlook?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It's surprisingly strong. And I think again, to some of the early discussions, it's really -- we're still seeing the benefit from new product introduction and this pushed towards energy efficiency. So while there isn't much new construction going on, there remains a very robust retrofit market. And I think with the line of products that Carrier has in terms of the very, very energy-efficient chillers, they're gaining traction in that market. And that's really what I would attribute the results of this quarter and our outlook for the year to.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "First one, just clarification on net proceeds from the divestitures, now that you've kind of come to consummation on the major ones, is it still net about $3 billion or plus or minus?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. Probably $3 billion plus. Again, I think we've still got a couple of pieces to go here yet. I think Louis mentioned, we work very, very close on the Clipper divestiture. I think you'll see that in the next, I don't know, couple of days, couple of weeks. But net-net, I think that $3 billion plus is still very good number. That's of course after tax. There's a little bit of tax leakage on the industrials.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then the real question is on cash flow for the year. Just looking at the generation you had in the first half, which is great, and looking at the second half, which should have in absence of pension contributions that have been there in prior years. I'm just at a loss as to why cash won't be as good if not better than -- significantly better than the last couple of years' back halves because of the absence of that pension contribution.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We're not going to change the guidance on cash flow but let me tell you...", "Louis R. Chenevert", "I thought you said better or equal.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. The cash flow is going to be very strong in the back half. And to your point -- there's no cash pension contributions. You also have the benefit in the back half of the year of the Goodrich amortization as we  write up some of their inventory and other assets and take some charges around -- some amortization charges. So yes, cash will be very strong in the back half of the year and I think once we get the Goodrich deal consummated later today, we'll come back in September with either Louis or one of us will probably update you on cash flow and I would expect it to be better than what we are currently guiding to.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And you mentioned the 1/3 of the deal price will be paid for from the assets or the divestitures plus cash from the cash flow. What's the pro forma cash position at the consummation?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We've got about $6 billion of cash on the balance sheet today. And I think there's -- we've got another $16 billion of restricted cash out there, which will go to pay off the owners. What we're really going to do is you'll close most of these deals at the end of the year. I think debt to cap of the end of the year will go down to about 48% and we'll continue to pay down even into next year. But I think again there's plenty of cash both from Goodrich operations as well as the UTC operations this year. We've got some cash on the balance sheet. I think paying down 1/3 of this, this year is not going to be an issue. With Rocketdyne closing probably early next year as opposed to late this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just wanted to just get a quick update on how it's going with the GTF, where we are in the development program and you've got multiple engines, right, or multiple platforms and maybe Louis could talk about that, what's going on with the GTF.", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Well, first of all, we're very happy with the traction of GTF in the market. And at this point in time, what we have seen is that the engine development is coming together nicely. All the advanced engineering we did and the technology readiness is paying off with, I would say, better than expected first time tests for all the engines we've got about, I think, it's 3,000 hours, we have even more cycles. We just did 2 very important tests. We did the flocking bird test on the GTF, which is the 5 1.5 pound bird and 1 2.5 pound, and we passed that with flying colors, maintained the performance required. We also did a large bird test. Those are all of the new FAA-required testing and that is basically passed very well. The large bird test. So there's only 1 test left, which is the blade-out test. All our modeling suggests we're on track. We're geared up to deliver this engine at the end of the year for the Bombardier application and every program behind. I would say, I always challenge the team because this program has gone remarkably well. And all the expertise we have in Pratt has come together to deliver what's been so far a very flawless program execution. So we're buttoned up, lined up on all the different platform. Everything is on track and you see it through the R&D investment. Obviously, it's a very intense period for R&D. And my commitment earlier was that 2012 was going to be the peak on R&D. And I would say that Dave and the team are holding to that commitment, that 2012 will be the peak on R&D. So everything is on track and I would say the customers, as we've won the different competition, the customers truly value the technology advantage of GTF and not only fuel burn, but noise reduction, emissions reduction and they feel very comfortable that our engine is coming together and we'll deliver on the promises. And every transaction, I would say, that Dave and the team have done, I have reviewed them with Greg and we're proud of wins we've got. We won on the merits of our technology and the platform and it's doing very well.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Now, maybe just 1 follow-on onto that. So far, everything's now about in [ph]. I mean, what -- how should we think about the potential investment and the whatever, a 90,000-pound-plus class engine for a wide-body. I mean, is this technology that can be moved up to that level? Is the company thinking about that?", "Louis R. Chenevert", "Well, I think what we have found out with the GTF architecture now is that it's also scalable. And I think that there's no doubt that the Pratt team has had discussions with some of the key players in the market that see the value of the technology. But you can expect that obviously, the operating discipline and the UTC discipline on program will apply. All this has to come together where it makes sense for the customers and the shareholders. And obviously even the GTF, and we have big partner content. Partners have been superb, by the way, whether it's the Japanese or MTU. And there's big appetite. As people see the success of our platform, there's big appetite to take on, basically, the portion of the program as a partner. And then that's something that's a big change over the last couple of years as people recognize we have a superior technology advantage in the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Schapiro from Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Louis, a kind of a long-term question. If I go back and look at Otis' history, you had 1 year of downturn, the last time being in '97 and the time before that, in '90, and then following that, a sharp snapback to record profits. My question is the difference is that you only made 10% margins then, and you're making over 20% today. So what is the risk to any steady margin degradation at Otis that would make this time kind of look like different than the 2 downturns we saw before?", "Louis R. Chenevert", "I've said that before as far as Otis margin, there's no doubt, Otis is a 20 plus percent return business. And I think nothing has changed. Obviously, we've had a soft patch in China over the last couple of months, I explained earlier on the queue that I think we have taken the right measures from a leadership structure, from the action with the dealer and it's starting to recover. I have high confidence in Otis' future results. I will also remind you that a big portion of the results always come from the aftermarket fees, which is paramount to Otis' base success. And that -- the install base has grown, by the way -- continues to be a huge opportunity and Pedro's hired recently 600 new mechanics that we are training to deliver the highest-value service to our customers. The unexplored territory is still the China aftermarket and I would say we're all over it at this point in time with the change in leadership we have done. Those guys are in the same time zone, they're there every day, they know the market. The nice thing about Otis is we're 95% localized in China. We are also a local leadership that understands the dynamic of our market. I think the changes we did allow to make decision on the spot, and I think that's going to start to create a lot of good momentum for aftermarket. So I think there's always pluses and minuses but nothing has changed as far as the fundamental of Otis being the leader in its segment and as you said before, there have been glitches before. We have another one. But I think Pedro's leadership is making a huge difference.", "George Shapiro", "I guess the thing I'm concerned about is the aftermarket, I'm sure, has been a big part of why the margins have gotten so high. And now you're talking about the pricing pressure. I mean, is that -- it would seem to be self-limiting, but can you provide some more color on how much down that might take the margins?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "George, I think the issue here is the aftermarket is very profitable. But we also make money on the OE side through all the factory cost reductions. And it's really been the balance between OE and the aftermarket that's been a success story of Otis over the last 7 or 8 years as they've driven these margins up, so -- and we've got this huge install aftermarket -- or install base of about 1.8 million elevators that we service around the world. And we also make money out of the OE side because we've been able to leverage the global scale of Otis. And even with sales which really haven't gone anywhere in 3 years, the margins have remained very strong, north of 20%. And I think if we get a little bit of growth, you're going to see the margins even improve further at Otis. So I'm not worried about a big long-term downturn in Otis margins. I think they have a focus on cost in everything that they do, they leverage global scale better than any other business that I'm aware of. And they've got their eye squarely on the goal of maintaining this industry-leading margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "First question was just -- in CCS, was that $112 million of favorable adjustments expected when you gave your original year-over-year changes?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, it was.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, related to George's question just on the Otis, you've highlighted, I guess, 3 different things in terms of the pricing issue, the brand issue and then the actual high-end residential pieces in China, and then I guess some of the pricing pressure and services in Europe. Could you just talk about what your assumptions are as you go through the remainder of the year in those different buckets? And really, is there any reason to think those trends continue into next year as well? Just trying to think about how much we can see Otis growing into the future periods.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think if you think about new equipment, we now think on a constant currency basis, sales will probably be flat for the year and service is only going to be up about 2 points. I think there is opportunity, obviously beyond that. I think one of the focus that Pedro and team have is reigniting top-line growth. Flat sales with China down is still pretty good, I think, and as China recovers, as the property market there recovers, there is upside in those markets. There's still long-term growth prospects in all these emerging markets. We talk about the 600 cities that are out there by 2025 that will more have more than 3 million people, and those are big opportunities for Otis in the next 15 years. And I think we're well positioned to capitalize on that. So I think it's a tough year this year. It's really a tough year because of the situation in Europe and some of the missteps we've had in China. To Louis' point, we've, I think, corrected those missteps in China, we're getting traction there, we'll recover our share, and Europe will get better eventually, whether that happens this year, next year, who knows. But I think we've got high confidence in Pedro and the team in terms of driving top-line growth, which we really haven't seen in 3 years.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And just a final question, just on Goodrich. Once that closes, really when will you be in a better position to talk about how we should think about the accretion into next year, the restructuring opportunities once you can get your hands on the books? Is that something September, October or is it going to wait until the December typical guidance?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think we'll have a pretty handle on September. We've got a couple of webcasts. Louis got one, I've got one and then we're going to have a -- we're going to host a half-day session up in Montreal at the end of September with all of the business units. And at that point I think Alain and team will be prepared to talk about next year. But I think again, we still feel good about this $0.50 to $0.55 that we've laid out for Goodrich accretion next year. And I don't think we've seen anything that would indicate that, that's going to be off by any order of magnitude. But again, I think by the end of September, we'll have our arms clearly around that.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Deane Dray from Citi.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just want to make sure I calibrated correctly on the guidance change. And so it's $500 million of restructuring and $600 million in gains, does that mean $100 million will be falling through to EPS?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, we really got $100 million out there that could fall through to EPS. Obviously, if we decide to spend that on restructuring, that would take you from kind of that midpoint down to the lower end of the guidance range. But right now, we're keeping that $100 million as kind of our back-ocket contingency.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Do you have a backlog of restructuring that you could implement? And what would you trigger you to add? You're seeing a number of companies this quarter increasing restructuring pretty aggressively.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, we've done -- by the end of this year, we will have done $2.5 billion of restructuring in the last 3.5 years. So it always amazes me that the units come up with new and good payback ideas. So right now, that $500 million that we have is fully subscribed and as we get closer towards '13 and then we kind of understand where the markets are going, there may be further call for additional restructuring. But again, I think the guys have been pretty aggressive in taking out structural cost to deal with the markets and that's why the margins are up this quarter, just continued cost [indisernible] and that's the formula until markets recover, we're going to focus on cost and restructuring and do what we do best.", "Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And anything else on the divestiture side? We know Clippers soon to have an announcement, fuel cell and then these required Goodrich divestitures. Anything else that you're contemplating?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, we're always looking at the portfolio, Deane. But I would think these are probably the biggest pieces. But as the year goes on, I think I would like to get a lot of -- any of the clean up of the portfolio behind us, so I'd say we're never done but we're certainly getting close to done.", "Louis R. Chenevert", "But the big elements of transformation will wrap up this year, it's that simple. That's where we'll leave it.", "Well, thanks, everyone. The UTC strategy of delivering top-line growth through innovative products, global market reach is solidly in place. We'll keep investing in our game-changing technologies and emerging markets and we always maintained our focus on cost reduction and productivity through the ACE operating system. As end markets recover, we will capitalize on our operating leverage and deliver a solid earnings growth. We'll continue to generate strong sustainable cash flow and effectively deploy that cash through dividend, share repurchase and M&A. Goodrich and IAE transactions are historic, transformational changes to the UTC portfolio that I am proud of and confident we'll generate superior shareholder value for years to come.", "Thank you for listening and we look forward to updating you on even more progress at the upcoming webcast through September. Thank you very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations.", "This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from UTC's website at www.utc.com.", "Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and onetime items as they usually do.", "The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. You saw on the press release this morning, third quarter earnings per share of $1.37 is down 4% versus 2011. The Goodrich acquisition, previously anticipated to be about $0.10 diluted in the quarter, did not have an impact on EPS due to lower onetime deal-related costs, lower amortization and better underlying performance of the business. IAE also had a solid performance in the quarter and contributed $0.03 of EPS.", "Restructuring charges were also lower than we expected due to a shift in the timing from the third to the fourth quarter and were completely offset by onetime gains. There was also a $0.04 benefit versus prior year on the tax line in the third quarter, which we talked to you about in our September investor meeting. The year-over-year benefit from restructuring and taxes nearly offset the $0.07 adverse impact from foreign exchange and a 2% decline in organic sales, driven mainly by the slowing global economy and a decline in U.S. defense spending.", "Organic sales declined 12% at Sikorsky and were down 1% and 2%, respectively, at Otis and Climate, Controls & Security. Organic sales at Aerospace Systems were up 6% but as you heard from Dave Hess, we've yet to see a recovery in Pratt's large commercial engine aftermarket business. Organically, Pratt & Whitney's large spares sales declined 25% in the quarter, and we now expect the full year to be down high teens.", "For UTC, we now expect full year sales of approximately $58 billion at the low end of our previous guidance range, driven by lower organic sales and partially offset by favorable FX compared to our last forecast.", "In spite of the top line softening, we continue to expect earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35 for 2012. With a solid start at Goodrich, better visibility on the amortization and lower-than-expected deal costs, we estimate that Goodrich dilution, excluding the impact of share repurchase, will be approximately $0.10 for 2012 as opposed to our prior expectation of $0.20. That's about $125 million better. And we expect a $50 million pretax benefit from our full year tax rate of 29%. That's 50 basis points lower than our previous guidance.", "Against an uncertain macroeconomic environment headed into 2013, we are preemptively increasing restructuring by $100 million in the fourth quarter. We now plan to invest $600 million this year, up from our previous estimate of $500 million. And for the full year, we now expect restructuring to be equal to onetime gains. And as spare order rates have remained depressed at Pratt & Whitney, we're also lowering Pratt's operating profit estimate by $75 million for the year.", "So let me sum it all up. There's $175 million of upside; that's Goodrich, $125 million; and the tax rate of $50 million, offset by $100 million of additional restructuring and $75 million of headwind from Pratt commercial spares. There's also some favorability from the weaker dollar versus our previous FX guidance and this should help offset potentially softer top line at some of the commercial units.", "Okay, now on to Slide 2, the third quarter. Total sales were up 6%, with acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 11 points of growth. The net acquisition benefit more than offset 3 points of unfavorable FX and 2 points of organic decline. The drop in organic sales is just a reflection of the global economic environment. North America is still struggling to gain traction, a slight recession in Europe and slowing growth in emerging markets.", "At the commercial businesses, North American organic sales were flat in the quarter and are only up 1% year-to-date. In Europe, in the commercial businesses, sales are actually down 3% while sales in the BRIC countries grew 2%. That was driven by double-digit growth in Russia and India.", "In Aerospace, robust commercial OEM organic growth was more than offset by weakness in the commercial aftermarket and military businesses. Commercial OEM sales were up 14%, led by double-digit growth in Aerospace Systems and Sikorsky. Commercial aftermarket, however, was down 14%, with the mid-teens decline at Pratt & Whitney more than offsetting mid-single digit growth at Aerospace Systems and 20% growth at Sikorsky. Sikorsky continues to feel the impact of reduced DOD spending with military sales down nearly 20% while Pratt & Whitney saw military sales up 20% on the back of F119 spare engine deliveries, which will wrap up later this year.", "Excluding Goodrich and the incremental IAE shares, segment operating margin was 16.1%, so actually up 10 basis points versus the prior year. Our focus on cost reduction and productivity more than offset 80 basis points of headwind for pension, E&D and FX.", "Free cash flow, very good in the quarter, 105% and that included a $200 million contribution to our domestic pension plan. We've taken the tough actions on our pension plan and we're well positioned with funding ratio of 84% even with the impact of Goodrich at historically low discount rates. And we have no ERISA funding requirements until at least 2015.", "Okay, moving now to Slide 3, looking at order trends. Similar to sales, order trends in the quarter were generally in line with the global economy. CCS' North American Residential HVAC orders were up 3%. Otis new equipment orders were up 11% at constant currency, including strength in North America. China new equipment orders contracted 2% at constant currency in the quarter, following a 16% decline in the first half as we steadily regain momentum. I'd also note that the Q3 2% drop in orders is off a very tough compare with Q3 of last year when orders were up 31%.", "Across the Aerospace businesses, we continue to see the impact of cash conservation at the airlines. Pratt & Whitney's large commercial spare orders were up 14% in the quarter, including the additional share of IAE. Excluding the incremental share, Pratt's orders were actually down 21% due to weakness, primarily in the wide-body fleet. Legacy Hamilton Sundstrand commercial spare orders were down 6%. So despite some weakness in our end markets, we continue to leverage our global scale and product innovation to strengthen the position of our industry-leading franchises.", "Backlog for our base businesses increased by $3 billion so far in 2012. And with the addition of Goodrich and IAE, total backlog now stands at $81 billion.", "Let me stop it there and turn over to Jay to take you through the business units, then I'll come back and wrap up '12 and talk a little bit about '13.", "Jesus Malave", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. At Otis, operating profit was down 10% on a 6% decline in sales. Foreign currency translation reduced sales and profit by 6 points. Operating margin was 22.7%, 1 point lower than prior year. At constant currency, new equipment sales were down low-single digit with mid-single digit declines in Europe and China, partially offset by mid-single digit growth in the Americas and the rest of Asia. Service was up slightly with higher contractual maintenance more than offsetting a slight decline in repair. The operating profit decline was driven by pricing pressure and lower volume in Europe and the absence of favorable real estate gains in last year's third quarter, which more than offset the benefit of cost reduction actions this quarter.", "At constant currency, new equipment orders were up 11% with over 20% growth in North America and in Europe, which benefited from a major contract award in the U.K. Although orders in China were down 2% in the quarter, the rate of decline improved from the previous 2 quarters, and Otis had solid order growth in September.", "Guidance for the full year remains unchanged with profits expected to be down $175 million to $225 million on a mid-single digit sales decline.", "On Slide 5. UTC Climate, Controls and Security once again saw a sharp increase in margin, up 270 basis points from prior year at 15.4% as profits increased 5% on 13% lower sales. Organic sales were down 2% as many of our end markets have not rebounded as we had previously expected. While there were pockets of growth such as the Americas Residential HVAC business and China, each up mid-single digit, the balance of the business generally saw low-single digit declines. Transicold was down high teens organically, led by a 60% decline in container sales. Despite the lack of organic sales growth, CCS grew earnings 5% or 8% at constant currency. Profit growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security and favorable net commodity costs. Global commercial HVAC orders were flat with growth in North America offset by a decline in Asia. Transicold orders were down about 25% with container down about 90%, partially offset by over 40% growth in North America truck/trailer.", "Orders for global Fire & Security products were up low-single digit. Given current market softness, fourth quarter organic growth could be softer than previously anticipated. The CCS team continues to take preemptive action to offset the impact of lower organic sales, but full year earnings guidance is under pressure. Margin expansion for the year, however, will still be strong given the benefits from productivity, cost reduction and portfolio transformation.", "Turning to Aerospace on Slide 6. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 16% in the third quarter, driven by the consolidation of IAE and the auxiliary power business transferred from Hamilton Sundstrand. Organically, sales were down 1% year-over-year, as higher military and Power Systems sales were more than offset by lower commercial aftermarket. Lower commercial spares -- large commercial spare sales were down 25% year-over-year. On a reported basis, large commercial spare sales were up 9%, including consolidated IAE sales. Operating profit in the quarter was down 10%. The impact of lower organic sales, including large commercial spares, higher E&D and pension costs, as well as unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada were partially offset by the benefits from the IAE consolidation, restructuring savings and a supplier settlement of about $0.04 per share.", "For the full year, we now expect Pratt & Whitney operating profit to be down $175 million to $200 million and sales up mid-single digit.", "On Page 7, our new segment, UTC Aerospace Systems, including Hamilton Sundstrand and 2 months of Goodrich, posted sales in the quarter of $2.7 billion with operating profit of $306 million. Organic sales in the quarter were up 6% with OEM sales up high-single digit, commercial aftermarket up mid-single digit and military aftermarket down 10%. Total aftermarket trends at Goodrich business units were slightly below legacy Hamilton Sundstrand. As Greg mentioned, Goodrich had better-than-expected results in the quarter. Organic operating profit at Aerospace Systems was down 5% after a strong first half, which was up 16%. The benefit from higher volume was more than offset by higher E&D and pension costs and lower license fees. With the benefit of approximately $50 million from lower-than-expected amortization, we now expect UTC Aerospace Systems' operating profit for the full year to be up $275 million to $300 million on approximately $4 billion of higher sales.", "Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 8. Operating profit decreased 6% on 6% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 62 aircraft. 54 aircraft were based on military platforms and 8 commercial. Lower sales were driven by fewer international military aircraft deliveries. On profit, the impact from lower international military aircraft and transition to the new multiyear contract more than offset favorable commercial aircraft mix, lower E&D spend and restructuring benefits across the enterprise.", "Of note, Sikorsky has received FAA certification for the S-76D. Deliveries will commence in the fourth quarter, and Sikorsky already has a backlog of over $400 million for this aircraft.", "For the full year, we continue to expect profit growth of $50 million to $75 million, and mid-single digit sales decline.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thanks, Jay. Businesses are clearly seeing softening on the top line from these tough end market conditions, but we remain focused on program execution and cost reduction, the things that we can control. At CCS, we continue to make very good progress on the integration of legacy Carrier and F&S businesses. We're consolidating locations and back office functions and streamlining customer service processes. We've saved over $50 million year-to-date without an impact on the customer, and CCS continues to stabilize the U.K. Fire & Security business, which grew profits for the second straight quarter. Otis China is also making progress in regaining its leadership position. On the Aerospace side, the Goodrich integration is off to a very good start, and as you heard from Alain Bellemare in September, we are realizing synergy sooner than expected and there will be opportunities for more. Pratt continues to win orders for the GTF and with an additional 546 firm and option orders in the quarter, Pratt now has a backlog of nearly 3,000 engines. And Sikorsky, as you just heard from Jay, achieved a major milestone this month, certifying the S-76D with deliveries starting here in the fourth quarter.", "The end market challenges are putting pressure on the business unit expectations for 2012, but with lower dilution from Goodrich, we're confident in our guidance range of $5.25 to $5.35. We continue to negotiate towards a win-win solution with the Canadian government for the Sikorsky Maritime Helicopter and we expect to provide you with an update at our December meeting. And with strong cash generation you come to expect from us, we now anticipate free cash flow will exceed net income for the year.", "Okay. Slide 10. Let's talk a little bit about 2013. Various [ph] framework for next year. This is the same that we laid out in September with the exception of the Goodrich amortization. With about $100 million of lower full year amortization, we now expect nearly $0.60 of accretion next year from Goodrich compared with the $0.10 of dilution in 2012, and we continue to expect an incremental $0.05 benefit from a full year of IAE.", "Turning to the base businesses. We've got great products and we're well positioned in the right markets for long-term growth. In addition to continuing growth from emerging markets, we should see solid growth in 2013 in the commercial aerospace OEM and aftermarket, in the U.S. residential HVAC business and in the U.S. commercial construction businesses.", "We expect Europe to be essentially flat next year, and we expect the declines in the U.S. Defense spending to continue even without the impact of a potential sequestration.", "Bottom line is that we're confident in our cost reduction and program execution and we have significant operating leverage should we see better-than-expected end market conditions.", "Of course, we still face some other significant headwinds in 2013. As you heard from Mick Maurer back in September, Sikorsky expects lower sales next year and 100 to 200 basis points of margin headwind before CMHP. Now that's primarily due to the new Multi-Year 8 and the lower DOD spending that we've been talking about. And of course, we'll have about $300 million of pension headwind at the current discount rate of 3.8%. We won't actually set the rate, of course, until year end, but you know the math. Every 10 basis points change in the rate costs us $28 billion.", "To sum it up. We've taken proactive, aggressive restructuring actions this year. Savings from these actions, combined with lower engineering and development, will drive earnings growth in 4 out of the 5 business units before pension and we will see about $0.75 of accretion from Goodrich and IAE year-over-year. We feel well calibrated for this year. The large deals are done, and we're focused on integration and execution. With our transformational deals, the new organizational structure, global industry-leading franchises and sustained structural cost reduction, we're well positioned for long-term earnings growth and strong cash generation. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Stephanie?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Let's start out over at Pratt. And Greg, I'm just wondering you had your meeting September 27, obviously very late in the quarter, and you're lowering here by $75 million, I think, all due to spares. So is it really -- I mean, can we infer from that, that really 2 weeks at the end of the quarter was responsible for the change in guidance, or is it maybe just looking more to the fourth quarter? And also at Pratt, if you could quantify that supplier payment?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, so -- yes, I think Dave laid it out pretty well back in September. He said that we are not seeing the order rates to actually support the spares, only down 10%. So I think Dave was pretty forthright with everybody in saying that we're not seeing it. And clearly, in the last couple of weeks of September we did not see any recovery in spares and we haven't seen it as we sit here today. So the takedown is all spares. I think, again, it's unfortunate to take down the guidance late in the year, but it is what it is on commercial spares. I think the good news as we dissect the data, the narrow-body platforms, the V2500s and the 757s, are actually -- have been recovering for a couple of quarters and where we see the weaknesses is primarily on the wide-body fleet and also in Europe. So again, not a surprise, I think. But it's clearly a tough market right now. As far as the supplier payment, that was about $45 million, $46 million, I think. It's actually a settlement. There was a legacy claim between Pratt and Goodrich, which relates to the -- from the sale on the CSeries. This had been in arbitration. We had an independent arbiter come in and we settled the claim and that was actually recorded on Goodrich's balance sheet as of the close, and Pratt recognized the benefit in this quarter.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, on Goodrich, you mentioned that Goodrich earnings were better than expected. Is that due to less amortization or is that real underlying performance? And what was -- I don't know if I missed it, but what was the organic aftermarket growth at Goodrich during the quarter?", "Jesus Malave", "Joe, organic aftermarket for sales was slightly below HS. HS had about mid-single digit growth in commercial aftermarket and Goodrich is a little bit below that. As far as military aftermarket, HS was down around 10% and Goodrich was down a little bit below that, close to mid-teens. And while we have the chance, I just want to correct the statement that I made before related to Sikorsky on Slide 8. I just want to clarify that operating profit decreased 6% on 12% lower sales.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Regarding the first part of your question, as far as the underlying business, Goodrich did do a little bit better than what we had expected. Again, there it was primarily Aero structures at the end of the quarter. Things actually looked better. But the amortization is clearly better. The big piece in the quarter that was really these transaction-related costs, which were better than what we had expected. We took, I'd say, a very conservative view as we were looking at all of these costs and we had expected to expense some things that ended up on Goodrich's balance sheet, so that helped by about $100 million and then you had better performance and a little bit better amortization.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the Otis order strength in North America. It sounds like Europe may be driven by the big metro project. Maybe there's something else there, elaborate on that also. But what was going on in North America? Is it more than a one-off?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think it's a trend that we have seen as a recovery in North America. And we've seen the ABI or Architectural Billing Index be above 50 for the last couple of months here and actually seeing good traction in quarters there. We got, of course, some new product introductions also that's helping on the -- in North America. It's attacking some of the hydro [ph] markets. So, yes, I think it's product introduction and a recovery there. So that actually feels pretty good. Europe, well, Europe is Europe. We did get good traction out of the Crossrail project. I think that's over 107 escalators for that London Crossrail. But the rest of Europe is not a great story. We saw down markets in France and Spain and Italy, a little bit better in Germany. But on the whole, a pretty tough Europe market outside of the U.K.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And then when you look at China down 2%, are you in position given kind of the comps and the trajectory to actually look positive on orders in Q4, or when do you see that happening, if you can, in fact, crystallize a view?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, my crystal ball is not terribly clear, but I would tell you we should be seeing order growth resume in Q4. As I said it earlier, orders were down 2% but that was off of a very tough compare last year where orders were up 31% at constant currency. So we are seeing a recovery. Last year, you'll recall China only grew 7% in the fourth quarter. So again, I think the trajectory that we saw in the -- coming out of the third quarter should continue into the fourth quarter. I think Pedro and team feel very confident we're getting share back and they're on track for a full recovery there.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And just can you give us a little more granularity on China? Is it high-rise resi? Is it bigger projects, central country? Just any other detail on what's going on would be helpful.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think it's actually really across the business we are seeing a recovery there. The commercial HVAC business remains soft there. I think some of the slowdowns that we've seen are actually playing out on the CCS side. On the flip side, residential's getting a little bit better. We saw that at CCS on their GST business, getting us some traction on order rates. For Otis, again, I think the property market has started to stabilize and come back a little bit. Still seeing good growth in the Tier 2 and 3 cities. Tier 1 is still pretty challenged. But again, that's not a surprise. It's a very uneven recovery in China.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Right. And just finally, just flipping over to Carrier. It looks like your resi business underperformed from what I can see from a couple others who reported in the quarter. Can you just give us some color on how you thought you did relative to the broader market and what's going on in the channels?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, underperformance is a relative term, Jeff. I think, and again, we saw -- I think, one of the competitors reported the other day that they had what looked like kind of mid-teens growth in the resi business. But I think that was off of a very tough -- or very easy compare from 2011. Carrier thinks they have held share hear this year. They've done pretty well. Channel inventories are very, very light. I think nobody wants to get stuck with inventory this time of year given all the uncertainty and the global economic situation and the fiscal cliff coming up, so channel inventories are probably at some of the lowest levels we've seen.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just one quick one -- actually a couple of quick ones. On the transport refrigeration on the container side, you said sort of down 90%, which is sort of where you were at your Analyst Meeting. Did you see any incremental order activity besides that little blip you called out in the meeting, or are we still kind of bouncing along the bottom in that business?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, actually, bouncing along the bottom is a relative term. Yes, I think we saw a little bit of good news post the Investor Meeting and we've seen some good news here in the fourth quarter. We're almost 50% booked in the fourth quarter. So orders, and again they're very lumpy as we know in this business, but yes, I think it's -- it looks achievable in terms of the forecast we've got out there right now for this year.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And on the spare side, I wondered if you might elaborate on a couple of other points. In terms of the wide-bodies, what you're seeing in terms of shop visits kind of year-over-year and also what you're seeing at Pratt Canada.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, so shop visits are a little soft on the wide-body fleet, and this is again the PW4000 fleet. I think the biggest impact is on the 747 fleet and probably a lesser impact on the 777 and A330 fleet out there. But clearly, we've seen lower shop visits. But I think more importantly, the average cost per shop is down substantially, like 25% down. So that's just gotten worse and not better from what we had seen earlier this year. We're getting good traction, as I said, on the narrow-body fleet. The Vs are up very strong, the spares in the quarter and even the 2000s had a nice recovery for the last couple of quarters.", "Jesus Malave", "Pratt Canada spares were down low-single digit in the quarter, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And one final one. You said Europe flat for next year is your kind of base case assumption. Does that assume anything different in terms of FX for next year than what's baked into this year's guidance?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think again -- FX, I think, is around $1.30 today. We've actually put our plan together to $1.25 kind of euro right now as we're looking at guidance for the last couple of months. So FX could actually be a bit of a tailwind next year versus what we've seen this year. I think, we're going to average $1.26 or something year-to-date, I think so. It could actually be a little bit of tailwind out of FX but who the heck knows?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "On CC&S, you had good margins there for the quarter. Could you talk about where -- what the puts and takes were with respect to margin? You didn't change guidance for the year and I was also wondering if the margins, were those above your expectations but being offset by weakness in the top line for the year?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I guess, that's exactly -- I mean, margins were very strong. We got about 1/3 of that came from the portfolio transformation, but the rest of it really came from cost reduction -- product cost reduction and restructuring and cost takeout in the base business. So I think again, it's -- it looks like the margins for this year will be at least 14% or so. So well on their way to the 15% goal that we've got out there.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And if you look across the business, the Fire & Security businesses and the individual parts within Carrier, are there some that you would point to where you saw more improvement than others?", "Jesus Malave", "In the field, Doug, both Europe and Asia were relatively flat from a sales perspective. Orders for products were actually up low-single digit this quarter.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think what you're seeing, though, Doug, is really broad-based cost reduction. I think, again, the structural cost takeout that we talked about is helping, but we're also seeing good news out of the factories. We're seeing good cost reduction out of the factories and that's both legacy F&S, as well as legacy Carrier businesses. I think our margins are holding up quite well on the commercial side, as well as on the resi side here in the U.S. Obviously, margin's under a little pressure at Transicold with volumes down as much as they are.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And then on the restructuring, the increase in restructuring cost for the year, can you talk about where that's focused, Aero versus the commercial businesses?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We've got a lot of programs lined up here. I think the biggest piece you'll probably see is going to be related to what we see is kind of this decline in Defense spending, so Sikorsky will have a good share of that. Pratt will pick up a big piece, as well as UTAS or our Aerospace Systems business. But again, I would tell you, there is restructuring appetite across all the businesses. Otis continues to find ways to take costs out. CCS, again, they're just starting on their journey from the structural cost reduction. So you will see additional restructuring from each of the businesses. And I would tell you when we started the year, I didn't see the appetite for $300 million, let alone $600 million for restructuring. And today, there's appetite for more than $600 million. So, again, I think that's -- just tells you how focused these guys are on cost reduction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Greg, I realize how challenged it's been to forecast earnings and still stay within the range. And so the harder question is could you help us a little bit with cash and sort of give us a walk as to where you are with the debt paydown plans, please?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Sure. Yes, so cash actually came in about what we expected. We got about 105% of net income. We're at 100% of net income year-to-date. The cash machine continues to chug right along. And I think for the year, we have solid visibility. We will nicely exceed net income and cash flow for the year. As far as the debt paydown, I think we're still on track. We expect to close on the Hamilton industrial businesses kind of early December time frame. We got a $2 billion term loan that we'll pay down. We've got about $4 billion of commercial paper, and then we'll pay down probably another $1 billion of other debt this year, so -- and most of that -- the rest of that cash will come from overseas. So, again, we've got a line of sight to, I'll say, about $7 billion of debt paydown by the end of the year. And something might slip into the first quarter, but I think clearly line of sight for the $7 billion.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And related to that, I mean, looks like you did -- I mean, you had a terrific number on, well, you haven't closed yet on electrical products, but based on sort of the filing, it would seem to me that you're going to more than exceed your forecast on some of the other divestitures. Is that a fair way to think about it?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think the market for these businesses is much stronger than was originally anticipated. And it's not -- I guess it shouldn't be surprising because they're really good franchises and franchises like the EPS business -- Electric Power Business at Goodrich don't come on the market very often. So we had a very robust bidding process for that business, as well as for the Engine and Controls business, that's located here in West Hartford. That bidding process is also robust. It's moving right along. So I'd say we'll be at the high end of our expectation range for both of those businesses. But again, good solid businesses, great products and technology. I hate to lose them, but, again, part of the regulatory process.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then related to corporate overhead, I mean, it looks as if you've been able to put together United Technologies and Goodrich and not really increase the overhead a whole heck of a lot. Have I -- are there some other gains or anything in there, or what should we think about that in terms of going forward?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Oh yes, clearly, as we put the Goodrich business together with Hamilton, we have seen or will see about $50 million of cost synergies this year. A big piece of that is public company costs. So I think Alain, as you would expect, is focused on a lean organization. We're not having a lot of overhead. And you're going to see that, I think, play out next year, as well as we continue to see solid cost reduction out of the Goodrich business.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then finally, you talked about avoiding a lot of transaction costs in the quarter and that was pretty helpful and then you're talking about increasing restructuring. Did those 2 items sort of in the end offset each other?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think if you think about it, we picked up about $0.10 on the Goodrich dilution this year and we picked up about $0.04 on the tax rate. You can offset that. We lost about $0.08 on restructuring, and we lost about $0.06 on the Pratt guidance reduction, so $75 million. So $14 million good, $14 million bad. It just kind of offset just naturally, if you will.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I want to go back to CC&S for a minute, Greg, and again put a little finer point on it. It looks like you were saying to an earlier question that you anticipate maintaining profitability going forward, but then you have some of the more profitable businesses, which have been rather weak. So wouldn't that intimate that you could do, even on potentially very slow revenue upside next year, better margins?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think you will see better margins next year at CCS. Again, it's a little early to call the markets next year. But generally, I think, Geraud and team feel pretty confident we should see a recovery at Transicold next year, especially on the container side. I think the U.S. resi business, again with housing starts up should recover next year. Commercial side and the U.S. ought to do better. So I think we're well on track. Again, I said 14% this year. 15% is the goal by '15. They're well on their way to getting there.", "Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Well, that's what I'm trying to drive to. I mean you could get there quite a bit earlier. I mean, again, just given that you had some of the more profitable stuff down and you've been doing the restructuring on an ongoing basis, so you'll start to get those benefits as early as next year, or is there some part of that I'm not getting right?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think you're right on it. Again, I'm hesitant to say we're going to get to 15% next year because again, who knows what happens in the end markets. I think Geraud and team have done a great job this year managing in what is a very, very tough macro environment. They've taken out costs, they've driven up margins, they've done their portfolio rationalization and they're going to hit that 14% this year. Can they hit 15% next year? Maybe. But I think, again, that's a great question maybe for Louis in December or better yet for Geraud next March.", "Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right. And then on -- turning on to Sikorsky, I just want to tease those businesses out a little bit better to understand the kind of puts and takes you're seeing there, Greg. Can you give us a little color on your aftermarket expectations in military and sort of your outlook for international military orders looking ahead?", "Jesus Malave", "International military...", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Let's just talk about military spares. Military spares, obviously, it's a tough market right now down at Sikorsky. And we expect that, that will be headwind again next year. Again, not a surprise with the optempo coming down in Afghanistan. And the uncertainty down at DOD, I think we've seen a reluctance of the procurement officers to go out and make advanced buys with all the uncertainty out there coming to a head in January. So those spares have been under pressure and they will remain under pressure next year.", "Jesus Malave", "As far as military aircraft, you'll recall that Mick, during September, said that part of the international military deliveries got pushed into 2014 because of the finalization -- delay in finalization of Multi-Year 8 contract signing.", "Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jay, what I meant was orders. You guys have a number of campaigns out there. Can you bring us up to speed on the campaigns?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I would tell you that there is a robust process there on the international side. I think we're seeing good traction in South America. We're seeing good traction in the Middle East. We're seeing good traction in India. I think, again, you'll see international Blackhawk, the S-70i, out of Mielec should start to pick up next year. And the deliveries really -- I think Mick has clear line of sight to 2014 to see a large increase in these international Blackhawk deliveries.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Greg, I was hoping you could make it a little simpler for me in terms of into 2013 with Goodrich and IAE. You increased or lowered the dilution for Goodrich for 2012 and you previously talked about a $0.75 EPS swing '12 into '13. Is that $0.75 still intact, or are we now talking about a lower swing because 2012 showed up better?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, no, it's well -- I think, the math is, I would say, it's complicated. But the fact is we have $0.10 of dilution now and Goodrich this year and $0.60 of accretion. So net-net year-over-year you ought to get a $0.70 benefit because of Goodrich plus 5% on IAE. We previously had talked about $0.20 of dilution this year and $0.50 of accretion next year. The fact is next year it gets better because of lower amortization costs, lower than expected. So that gives you -- it takes you from the $0.50 to the $0.60 and that benefit also helps this year.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then on spares, Greg, I think you said high teens organic declines. Could you separate -- create the differential on the organic declines between for the full year what you're seeing on the 2500s versus the wide-bodies? And then also, the wide-bodies, can you parse out what's just been retired and taken out of the fleet that never comes back?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I can't give you the kind of granularity in terms of what may have been retired. I think it clearly is, as we were talking earlier, the 747-400s, the PW4000s, those have been probably the hardest hit. Now whether some of those have been retired or not, I couldn't tell you. Clearly, flying hours are down on that fleet. On the other hand, you see 777s, again the 4000, those are 112 inch. Those, the flying hours are actually up. We just have seen the airlines be very reticent to spend a lot of money at repairing the engines as they've come back. So again, I think 747-400s are probably the hardest hit and then 777s less so. And then again real solid recovery on the Vs as we had expected when we bought IAE.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So it's full year '12 though for the Vs, mid-single digit declines?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Say that one more time.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "If you just separated out the V2500 organic spares for 2012, what did that look like?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think you actually see an increase.", "Jesus Malave", "Yes, for the full year, Myles, you should probably see an increase anywhere between low- to mid-single digit. And really, we're benefiting again from the higher cycles, as you know, on narrow-bodies.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then the last one, was the Pratt settlement previously in the guidance, or was it kind of concluded post the guidance?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think we had known about this for some time, so that was contemplated in the numbers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So this year, the Goodrich, yes, maybe you could walk us through. So you said $50 million kind of lower intangibles. Maybe -- and what you had -- R&D was $101 million. So presumably, that was an accounting conformity negative. So maybe walk us through kind of what are the step-up in intangibles this year for Goodrich? What should we think about for next year? You said $100 million lower, but from what to what? What should the accounting conformity be this year and next year? And you mentioned synergies, $50 million. What is it next year? And what is the restructuring? Is any of the incremental restructuring there at Goodrich?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay. Let's start out with the amortization for this year. I think we have seen lower amortization. So I think there was $140 million of amortization we now expect for the year. I think -- I'm sorry, that's for the quarter, the $140 million?", "Jesus Malave", "$140 million was the absolute number of amortization in the third quarter.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "In the third quarter, $130 million of that was from inventory step-up. About $10 million of that was the net of inventory intangible amortization. So again, you should see that inventory will repeat again in fourth quarter, as well as the intangible amortization. Next year, there's no inventory amortization. I think that's all behind us. So what you're down to is about $50 million of intangible amortizations net next year.", "Jesus Malave", "Yes. Cai, the best way to look at it, if you recall the charts that we've shown, we've lumped amortization and accounting conformity together, it's $500 million previously. The best way to look at it is that now goes to $400 million, the combination of those 2 items.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So let's just stick with this course. So we have $100 million this quarter of accounting conformity because, I guess, I'm a little confused. If you had $140 million of accounting intangibles and step up $100 million of accounting conformity and synergies, a little tough for me to see how you got to breakeven?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, again, I think the $100 million is really the run rate for the accounting conformity.", "Jesus Malave", "Yes. Cai, $100 million is the total E&D at Goodrich. Part of that E&D always went to the P&L. It was just put into SG&A in their form of reporting. So the piece -- I can't tell you -- I don't know what that piece is just on an accounting-conformity basis.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then -- so we're really going to get like a $280 million swing next year because you're going to lose the inventory step-up is all this year, correct?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "That's right.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then on the restructuring. You said $100 million given you've taken your total restructuring up. Is Goodrich still $100 million, and what should we think about for next year?", "Jesus Malave", "The Goodrich restructuring this year is closer to about $150 million. We said, I think, next year in a range of $100 million. As far as amortization, though, Cai, we just have to recall that next year is 12 months versus 5 months this year on amortization.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So what is the number? I think Greg said, what was...", "Jesus Malave", "Yes, $50 million of amortization next year.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "For the whole year?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "For the whole year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "When we think about going into the fourth quarter and we think about what you guys are implying about where fourth quarter -- the fourth quarter numbers will be compared year-over-year, I think they kind of really decelerate into the fourth quarter. Is that how we should be thinking about it, or you're just being conservative? Or how should we think about the fourth quarter number?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So I think what you're going to see is you see pretty good acceleration in the base businesses. The segment results should be better. I think you'll see solid growth at CCS. You'd see over $100 million of earnings growth there. You should see a little bit of growth come back at Otis. I guess Sikorsky should have a very big fourth quarter. They've got almost 100 helicopters to deliver. So base business is actually going to do very, very well here in the fourth quarter. I think we got confidence that we're going to hit that number. The downside, I think, as you think about fourth quarter actual EPS is you got about $0.25 of headwind in the fourth quarter from restructuring. And not surprising. We've got about $270 million of restructuring to go. We've spent $330 million so far. So you're going to see a big $0.25 or so of net restructuring in the quarter.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then maybe over to Sikorsky real quick. Any more color on what's going on with the Canadian Maritime Helicopter and where that negotiation with the Canadian government is?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I'd like to say we're making good progress. What we want here, and I said it before, we need a win-win on this with the Canadian government. Obviously, we're disappointed we haven't been able to deliver the helicopters. We're building them right now down at West Palm. We'd expected to build 5 -- build and deliver 5 this year, build and deliver 19 next year. We're well on our way for all those helicopters. But until we have an agreement with the Canadian government in terms of the final configuration and an interim configuration, we really can't ship anything. So as I sit here today, I tell you we don't have a solution. I certainly hope by the time Louis stands up in early December, we can give you guys some more clarity on it. But right now, all I know is that we need to continue to work with the Canadians to find a win-win here.", "Jesus Malave", "We're ready to deliver the 5 aircraft. It's just a matter of letting this negotiation play out.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, okay. Then maybe just one last quick one on Aero aftermarket. Do you have a sense for what impact cargo has had versus passenger? Meaning, is your cargo business much more off than your passenger business?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, Ron, I really don't have a lot of granularity between cargo versus regular. I would tell you that cargo's not a big piece of the fleet. And the hours on cargo are much lower than the hours that we see on the regular commercial flight, so the overhaul cycle is much, much longer. So haven't really seen a pronounced impact from cargo versus commercial.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "The reason I ask is if you go back a couple of years after '08, Goodrich had a couple of rough quarters largely due to cargo, so I'm just trying to get a sense for what impact it's having now.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I have not heard that either from the Pratt team or the Aerospace Systems team. We'll check it out and we'll get back to you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Greg, I just wanted to get to this Goodrich dilution a little differently. In the 8-K, you said the pro forma for '11 was $0.50 a share accretion and now you've upped it to $0.60 in '13. So what are the variables that go into that added $0.10 from '11 to '13? Obviously, there's cost saves and whatever, there's some growth in the business, but if you could spell out the differences?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think, again, if you think about that $0.50 versus the $0.60, really, the only difference is lower net amortization for next year. I mean, this year, we had deal costs and we had little better performance in the business as well as lower amortization. But next year, we're really we're getting about -- we're getting north of $100 million of lower amortization, more like about -- well, almost $0.10, I guess, of lower amortization costs, probably $120 million, $130 million of lower amortization costs.", "George Shapiro", "Now that's relative to 2011, I'm asking, not '12. Because you've provided the pro forma numbers in the 8-K that you disclosed a couple of weeks ago and that showed $0.50 accretion in '11 on the pro forma, so I was asking for the comparison '11 to '13?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, we're just looking at it here.", "Jesus Malave", "Yes.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "George, I think we're going to have to get back to you on that. I have not gone back into these pro formas. I haven't really focused on 2011 very much since, well, since last year. But we can go back and took a look and get an answer for you.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then the other one is you said IAE will be accretive $0.05 next year, but it was accretive $0.03 this quarter, so why is it only $0.05 next year?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Because you get another 1/2 a year. So you're going to get $0.05 of accretion this year and another $0.05 next year. So $0.10 in total next year, $0.05 incrementally.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Greg, just on the 2013 outlook, you've put the commercial aerospace aftermarket as a positive. Is that looking on a reported basis because of the inclusion of IAE, or is this looking at it on organic basis?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, that's on an organic basis, Rob. I mean, again, if you think about Pratt spares being down high teens, we've seen Hamilton Sundstrand legacy down, we've seen Goodrich down a little bit. I think just based on what we're seeing from a flying hours perspective, we know that we're going to see the spares come back, and I think it's just a matter of timing. And I don't know if that's first quarter, second quarter or third quarter of next year or even fourth quarter of this year, but spares will come back. So we've got high confidence we're going to see good news on the commercial aero aftermarket organically next year, not just the addition of the acquisitions.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just follow-up on the aftermarket. You've given us quite a lot of detail on what you're seeing at Pratt with the wide-bodies. I was wondering if you could explain maybe what's going on in Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich and why the orders there and the spares there are a bit soft relative to flight hours maybe.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think that's the $64,000 question at Aerospace. Again, Pratt, we've got much better visibility because it's all time-based overhauls primarily. So we know the schedule when these engines are supposed to come back. And for the most part, they're coming back as we had expected because they're putting the flying hours on. On the Goodrich and the Hamilton legacy, that is all condition-based. They're on-condition repairs. So in other words, if you have a failure in the field, you're going to see the units come back in. And quite frankly, these LRUs, the Line Replaceable Units, the airlines do have inventory of these various parts that Hamilton and Goodrich make and they're bringing down inventory, we believe, and not sending everything back for repair. So again, I think we will see, just based upon flying hours, a recovery there to a more normal kind of 5% to 7% growth year-over-year starting next year on the Aerospace Systems side. But this year, I think it's just all about airline cash conservation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Greg, in terms of next year, when you think about the noncash and the cash items, I mean, you're going to have a fair amount of noncash stuff running through with the pension and the amortization. Are there any big kind of cash offsets in terms of pension contributions or working capital dynamics in the businesses?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think there's 2 offsets that we have to keep in mind and we still have to manage. One is there's an appetite for additional inventory to support the build on the commercial OE side. So again, I think we see pressure at Pratt & Whitney. We see pressure at the Aerospace Systems side for inventory. And we also see an appetite for those businesses for CapEx. And I think that's, again, something we need to meter out effectively. We need to make sure that we take full advantage of all the facilities that we now have between Pratt and legacy Hamilton and Goodrich. So like I think -- initially, everybody wants to build everything new, buy everything new. We just need to think about that and we'll come back with a specific guidance. But I'll tell you, there's pressure on CapEx and there's pressure on working capital, specifically inventory.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And pension contributions?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Again, we made $200 million of pension contributions this year because cash, as I said, has been very strong. It's actually a good place to put our money. We get an 8% return on it in the pension plan. But we have no funding requirements under the ERISA rules until at least 2015. And quite frankly, we're 84% funded at the pension plan today and if I get to a discount rate of 5.5%, which is where we were 2 years ago, we'd be fully funded. So the last thing we want to do is throw more cash into the pension plan.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And then just can you explain a little more why the Goodrich amortization went down? I mean, did you assign a lower value to something that would have been amortized? Could you just explain that a little more?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I think what we found is there were some several contracts in the legacy Goodrich business, which were in loss-making positions. And as we've changed the accounting to our accounting conformity, we were -- we had to recognize those losses upfront. So we actually provided for that as a liability, if you will, going forward. That's now getting amortized and offsetting some of the other intangibles. Again, we initially had not expected to set up this liability, if you will, for these loss-making contracts. If you remember, the Goodrich accounting, they took a look at the contract over its life and had a very, very long-term view. We've got, let's say, like an 8-year life for looking at these contracts that are loss-making. So we amortize the intangibles on these loss-making contracts over that 8-year period.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, my first question was just on the Otis operating profit progression so I guess you had pretty high decrementals in the sort of mid-high 30% range in Q2 and Q3. You're saying that profit should grow though year-on-year in Q4 even though your revenues are probably down. So I guess I'm trying to figure out what's going on in the cost base. Is it to do with mix that you think European aftermarket maybe is now stabilizing in Q4, or is it that you've added a lot of costs in places like China and that kind of hiring is now coming to an end, so you get a natural lift on incrementals or something?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Really there's 2 things that impacted first half of the decrease in margins. Part of that was pricing, we've talked about that. I think we've probably seen $75 million year-to-date of pricing impacts, about 1/2 of that in Europe. We also had commodity headwind in the first half of the year related to the rare earth. Again, that was something that probably started playing out last year and really, by the middle of this year, by third quarter, had gone away but certainly hurt first half margins. We've added a little bit of cost on the SG&A line. But again, that's just positioning Otis to take advantage of what's going on over in China. We've moved the businesses' strategy development to Shanghai. We've opened up the high-rise CLC in Shanghai. So there are a little bit of investment, but really the story is in the first half has been pricing and it's been commodities.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, switching to your 2013 outlook. I just wondered the commercial Aero OEM side, that comes up in sort of a plus and a minus. Is that just the difference between regions or wide-body versus narrow-body or...", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, the reason we put commercial Aero OEM up there is a positive. Certainly, on the revenue line it will be a positive. There will be some headwind from negative margins and some of the -- especially on the engine side, I think, especially probably on the -- there will be the A380, the GP7000 engine. They basically ramped up production at Airbus, we'll see some headwind there. So good news on the top line, not as much on the bottom line.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a clarification once again on Goodrich. You had said in your prepared remarks that it's $125 million better. But then the, I guess, Aerospace Systems business, you're saying is only $50 million better for the year. What's the gap in there did you bring down for Hamilton?", "Jesus Malave", "The other piece, Sam, is related to the deal cost that Greg mentioned and that is in corporate elims. So the $125 million, a piece of it is in the segment and a piece of it is in UTC corporate elims.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then the growth in the receivables of about $1 billion in inventories, almost $2 billion, how much of that would be the core business versus just layering in Goodrich, and I guess, IAE as well?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, most of that build is actually Goodrich and IAE. I don't know if I've got the exact numbers down here, but actually, let us get back to you, Sam, on that. Because again, I think, the large majority of those additional AR and inventory, all that working capital is really related to the acquisitions.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just the last thing is on the order rates as we look into the fourth quarter. You've already mentioned North American or just CCS easy comps. It looks like Pratt large commercial also has pretty easy comps. And even Otis new equipment isn't that bad. I mean should we be seeing positive bookings across all the segments in the fourth quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I would think so with the exception, perhaps, at Transicold. Again, I think last year fourth quarter was still pretty strong at Transicold. So that's a pretty lumpy business, as I said. So that would be the one caveat I would say to order rates. Everything else, again, I think we had seen a pretty slow fourth quarter last year on the order intake side, so should be pretty easy compares both at Otis and the Aero businesses.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And Pratt commercial spares, if you have the same dollar amount in this third quarter versus the easy compare in fourth quarter, would we actually see bookings up next year -- I mean, next quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I'm sorry, if we had orders in the...", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Similar dollars. If it was just sequentially flat in the December quarter from the September quarter, do we end up with a positive comparison?", "Jesus Malave", "No, Sam. You would be down. Last year was pretty flat throughout the year.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay. I want to thank everybody for listening. I know it's, again, a lot of stuff going on in UTC here. We'll see you guys all in December next for Louis' annual guidance. We're going to continue to focus on what we do best. We're going to focus on integration, we're going to make sure we're accelerating on cost reduction and we're going to focus on outperforming the peers. And that's what we do every day here. So thanks, everybody, and have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory Hayes", "Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. We saw in the press release this morning no surprises. UTC closed out a transformational 2012 just as Louis laid out for you in December. Full-year sales were just under $58 billion, that was up 4% from 2011. That, of course, was driven by the Goodrich and IAE acquisitions. Earnings per share was $5.35 and that included about $0.50 of headwind from FX, pension and E&B.", "For the year, Goodrich is only about $0.06 dilutive, a little better than what we had expected due to lower amortization, financing and one-time deal costs, and more importantly, better underlying performance in the Goodrich business.", "Free cash flow was again strong at 108% of net income attributable to common share owners and we paid down about third of the Goodrich debt just as we had planned. As we all know, 2012 was a challenging global economic environment and while there is still plenty of uncertainty ahead for 2013 in both Europe and the U.S., we have seen signs of stabilization, particularly in Europe and we have started to see a gradual recovery in the U.S. Economy led by a rebound in housing market.", "We continue to expect solid growth in emerging markets throughout the coming year. As you have come to expect from UTC, we just didn\u2019t wait for the economy to recover. We proactively leveraged our scale and optimized our cost structure while we continue to invest in game changing technologies, all the while transforming the portfolio to take advantage of the growth opportunities over the next decade in our core markets of aerospace and commercial buildings. We also took the difficult actions this past year, reducing our structural overhead cost and focusing on global growth markets. In 2012, we invested nearly $600 million in restructuring of which $258 million was in the fourth quarter alone, as the businesses continued to find solid payback projects to reduce costs and position us for earnings growth this year and beyond.", "Okay, slide two. Turning to fourth-quarter results. Total sales increased 14%, again driven by Goodrich and IAE. Organic sales were flat in the quarter, a slight improvement from our third quarter results. Segment operating profit was also flat, although Climate, Controls & Security had a very strong quarter with 17% operating profit growth on flat organic sales. As expected, Sikorsky did not ship any of the Canadian maritime helicopters in the fourth quarter but we did record a charge of $157 million related to costs associated with the program delay as we now expect. While we are continuing discussions with the Canadian government, we are also encouraged by the progress we have made since Louis spoke to you in December. There is nothing new to report today but we are cautiously optimistic and Mick will provide you with a full update in March. We are also maintaining our place order of eight aircraft deliveries for 2013 at Sikorsky and there is no change to the projected P&L impact of those deliveries. If you recall, that\u2019s a loss of lot about $14 million per aircraft.", "Right, back to Q4. Segment operating margins was down 200 basis points with a CMHP charge in Goodrich acquisition, each accounting for about 100 basis points of the headwind. Restructuring, savings and productivity benefits offset a $140 million of headwind from pension, E&D and FX.", "Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.04. That includes $0.25 of restructuring and one-time charges. The restructuring was spread across the business units, including $75 million of UTC Aerospace Systems, as they continue to make good progress with the Goodrich admiration.", "Excluding restructuring, one-time items in the fourth quarter of both years' earnings per share decreased about 9%. The tax rate was 30.1%, a little better than we expected back in December, but still a $0.08 headwind versus last year. Free cash flow very strong 139% of net income, great performance especially as we contributed nearly $200 million in cash for international pension plans.", "Moving to slide three, order trends. As you can see, they are showing signs of improvement. Pratt & Whitney's large commercial spares orders were up 46% in the quarter including the additional share of IAE. Excluding that incremental share, Pratt's orders were down 8%, however 21% decline in the third quarter.", "Legacy Hamilton Sundstrand commercial spares orders were down 4% following a 6% decline in the third quarter, but importantly book-to-bill for both, Pratt and Aerospace Systems was over 1% for the quarter, so the rate of decline has moderated at the Aerospace Systems unit and we saw a good order growth across the commercial businesses in the fourth quarter.", "UTC climate, controls and securities, North American residential HVAC orders were up 20%. Global commercial HVAC orders grew 7% in constant currency. And at Otis new equipment orders were up 13% at the same basis. And importantly, Otis saw a new equipment order in China grow 17% at constant currency as they continue to gain momentum there. Orders also grew in North America, up 18% while not surprisingly Europe was down slightly.", "We also saw solid growth in emerging markets. The combined BRIC order for the commercial business units were up 11% this quarter, so order trends broadly improving, a good leading indicator for UTC's return to organic growth in 2013. I'll get back in a second to talk about 2013, but let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the business unit results.", "Jay Malave", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to page four, Otis operating profit was down 5% on flat sales in the quarter. Foreign currency translation reduced sales and profit by one and two points, respectively. Operating margin was 21.9%, 110 basis points lower than prior year.", "At constant currency, new equipment sales were down slightly as growth in China and the Americas was offset by declines in Europe and the rest of Asia. Service was up low single-digit led by growth in modernization and contractual maintenance.", "Lower volume and continued pricing pressure in Europe more than offset the benefit of ongoing cost reduction and profit growth in the rest of the world. As Greg mentioned, at constant currency, new equipment orders were up 13% with double digit growth in all areas except Europe, where orders were down slightly. China orders for the quarter were up 17%, solid improvement after being down 11% over the first three quarters of the year.", "For the full year, profit was down 7% and 3% lower sales. At constant currency, profit fell 3% on flat sales. We expect the improving new equipment order rates, especially in China in the aggressive cost reduction and restructuring actions taken over the past year to result in the return to profit growth in 2013.", "On slide 5, climate, controls and security drove profits up 17% on 6% lower sales, resulting in another sharp increase in margins, up 270 basis points from prior year to 13.7%. Organic sales were flat overall with mixed results across the businesses. Mid-single digit growth in the Americas led by solid growth in residential HVAC was offset by low double-digit and mid-single digit declines in Transicold and the U.S. Security business, respectively. Asia and EMEA were flattish.", "CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth despite flat organic sales. Profit growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security, lower commodity cost and a $22 million special dividend from a distribution partner.", "Global commercial HVAC orders were up 7%, driven by a sharp uptick in China towards the end of the year. Transicold orders were flattish with container down about 10%, offset by growth in Europe and North America truck trailer.", "Commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were down high single-digit given economic conditions in that region while orders for global Fire & Security products were up low single-digit.", "Current order rates are consistent with our expectations for a gradual resumption of organic sales growth at CCS this year. For the full year 2012, CCS grew earnings by $116 million or 5% on flat organic sales. With operating margin at 14.1% up 190 basis points from prior year. CCS is well positioned to achieve 15% margin in 2013, two years ahead of target.", "Turning to aerospace on slide six. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 12% in the fourth quarter driven by the consolidation of IAE and the AeroPower business. Organically, sales were down 4% year-over-year as Higher Military, Pratt & Whitney Canada and Power System sales were more than offset by lower commercial aftermarket. Large commercial spare sales were down 18% organically year-over-year.", "On a reported basis, large commercial spares were up 30% including consolidated IAE sales. Operating profit in the quarter was down 25%. The impact from lower organic sales of large commercial spares, unfavorable engine mix and higher E&D and pension costs were partially offset by the benefits from the IAE consolidation and restructuring savings.", "Also the prior year included the benefit of about $0.04 from a contract termination. Commercial spares orders were down 8% organically and up 46% including the benefit from the IAE consolidation. Embraer's recent selection of the GTF to power the second generation E-Jet family is another significant endorsement of the technology. Even with small incremental E&D from this win, Pratt & Whitney still expects to increase profit by 100% to 150% on mid to high single-digit sales growth in 2013.", "UTC Aerospace Systems which includes the Hamilton Sundstrand business and the full quarter of Goodrich finished the year strong with sales in the quarter up $3.2 billion and operating profit of $339 million. Organic sales in the quarter were up 4% with OEM sales up high single-digit, commercial aftermarket up mid-single-digit and military aftermarket down mid single-digit.", "On a pro forma basis, Goodrich sales in the quarter were flattish. Orders for commercial spares were up sequentially both at the legacy Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich businesses. Organic operating profit in the quarter at Aerospace Systems was flattish with the benefit of higher volume offset by higher E&D and pension costs. The EPS impact from Goodrich in the quarter was neutral to UTC's results.", "Turning to Sikorsky on slide eight. Operating profit decreased 20% on 3% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 91 aircraft. 77 aircrafts were based on military platforms and 14 commercial. Higher sales were driven by international military and commercial aircraft volumes, partially offset by lower aftermarket sales and the absence of two Canadian maritime helicopters in 2011.", "Operating profit benefited from higher international military and commercial aircraft deliveries but was more than offset by the charge taken on the CMH program. For the year, Sikorsky delivered 243 aircrafts, including the CMH charge operating profit of $765 million was down 7% on 8% lower sales. Accordingly we are updating Sikorsky's 2013 operating profit guidance. We now expect profit to be down $100 million to $150 million versus our prior guidance of about down $250 million to $300 million. Despite the earnings decline in 2013, Sikorsky is well positioned. We announced $10.9 billion of orders in 2012 and ended the year with a record backlog of over $14 billion including Denmark's selection of our MH-60R for its maritime helicopter replacement program and orders for more than 35 aircrafts in the fourth quarter.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.", "Gregory Hayes", "So close to 2012, that was essentially in line with our expectations and importantly order rates that have been coming our of the fourth quarter that give us confidence as we head into 2013. Before I talk about 2013, let me just spend a minute on some of the accomplishments for 2012 and obviously 2012 was a transformational year for UTC, as we repositioned the portfolio to focus on those key growth markets of aerospace and commercial buildings but businesses had some other big accomplishments.", "Pratt & Whitney made great progress in developing the GTF and bringing this disruptive technology to market. We have now completed nearly 4,200 hours and more than 12,400 cycles of full engine testing. We recently completed the final significant tests on the C-Series engine, including the FAA mandate of 150 hour endurance test and we expect to certify this engine shortly.", "As you saw, the GTF has also been selected to power Embraer's second generation E-Jet family, the fifth airframe manufacture to use our technology. This is a big win for Pratt & Whitney, and solidifies our position in the regional jet market well into the future. And with nearly 3,000 firm and option engines in backlog airline customers have embraced the lower fuel burn, emissions, noise and operating cost of the GTF technology.", "At UTC Aerospace Systems, the integration of Goodrich is progressing well. We've deployed a customer-facing organization with a single point of contact for our key customers around the globe and we've conducted innovative program reviews with many of these customers. We are developing new solutions based on the best technology from each of the legacy organizations and we've achieved over $60 million in cost synergies in 2012, and we are well on pace to achieve nearly half of the $400 million in synergies by the end of this year.", "At Sikorsky, we secured BLACK HAWK demand for the next five years of the Multi-Year 8 contract, part of a record $10.9 billion in orders of Sikorsky in 2012. The climate, controls and security team integrated the carrier and Fire & Security businesses seamlessly. Nearly $100 million in savings in 2012, help CCS grow operating profit 5% despite flat organic sales with 14.1% operating margins, they are well ahead of the schedule on their goal to 15% by 2015, and Otis continues to regain momentum in China.", "Although new equipment sales declined 2% in 2012, orders grew 17% in the fourth quarter. As orders continues to win significant projects such as the Guangzhou Fortune Center, where we're going to sell 49 elevators include Gen2 and double-deck units. Otis is well positioned in China entering 2013 with a $1.5 billion backlog, so good progress with the business units despite the challenging macroeconomic environment in 2012.", "As we look at 2013, really not much change to the expectation that Louis laid out in December. We continue to expect 2013 earnings per share of $5.85 to $6.15 on sales of $64 billion to $65 billion. That's organic growth of 3% to 5%. That has some positive developments since our December meeting, the pension cost came in a little better than expected with a discount rate of 3.9 versus our plan of 3.8, and we have planned return last year the domestic plan of 14% and there are two pieces of the Tax Extenders that were passed as part of The American Taxpayer Relief Act in January, which will benefit us in 2013.", "First, the benefit from the 2012 E&D extenders will provide us with the first quarter pre-tax benefit of around $100 million. This will drop the tax rate of the quarter and offset some of our restructuring investments this year. For the, we now expect $300 million of restructuring offset by one-time gains and that's up from the previous estimate 200 million. The 2012 piece of the Tax Extender, who partially offset a tough compare in the first quarter 2011, which you will recall had $0.21 of gain in excess of restructuring.", "The second piece of the Tax Extender to 2013 benefit will be booked throughout the year and will reduce our 2013 tax rate to about 29%, which is our initial expectation of 29.5. We're also keeping an eye on FX. Europe remains a question mark, but we have seen some recent upside to our plan of the euro, U.S. dollar exchange rate of 128, with euro averaging about 1.32 so far, so a little bit of good news.", "So, in summary, we're seeing good news on pension, FX and the Tax Extenders and that gives us some additional contingency for 2013, but I'll just remind everybody it is early and there's still a lot of uncertainty in some of our key end markets, particularly Europe and the aerospace aftermarket.", "Our plan as you recall is based on 3% to 5% organic growth. Now, although order trends have been improving, commercial spares where we are yet to attain our growth assumption of mid-single digit in Pratt and about 10% in Aerospace Systems. And with the continued fiscal uncertainty in Washington and the threat of sequestration, we remain cautious early in the year.", "Turning to cash flow, very strong close to 2012 with free cash flow of 108% of net income for the year, we made significant progress on debt reduction, delivered our commitment by paying down about a third of the Goodrich-related debt in 2012. We've paid down the $2 billion term loan, all of the commercial paper and about $800 million of the Goodrich debt.", "In 2013, combination of solid cash flow performance in proceeds for the remaining divestitures will position us well to pay down additional debt and to fund our share repurchase program which we restarted this January. There's been an increase in investment for the aerospace OEM ramp. We expect free cash flow equal to or excess of net income.", "2012 was a transformational year for UTC, and as we entered 2013 with a stronger portfolio, we are positioned to outperform. Our end markets are showing improvement and we are focused on integration, execution and delivering the EPS growth that you've come to expect from UTC.", "Just one final point before I open it up for Q&A. I know there was a lot of questions and concerns about the 787. And as you guys know, we're a key supplier on the 787. Although we do not supply the lithium ion battery or the battery charger, we are supporting both, Boeing and the NTSB in their ongoing investigation. The 787 went through the most rigorous certification process in aviation history. We are highly confident in the design and the performance of the aircraft. While reviewing the ongoing review by regulatory authorities, I can't make any further comments at this time, other than to say that we don\u2019t believe the results of these investigations will have a material impact to UTC.", "So with that, let's open up the call for questions. Stephanie?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Greg, can you just elaborate a little bit more on Sikorsky for us. So the charge in the quarter is basically just late fees as it were because the deliveries didn\u2019t happen?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, let me take you through it. Really, the charge was related to all the costs that we foresee related to what we believe will be later deliveries than contractually required. As you know, we are supposed to deliver all the aircraft this year, the final 19. We didn\u2019t delivery any next year. So our expectation, our assumption now is that we will deliver the helicopters over the next three years. We put a placeholder of eight, as you know, for each of the next three, which we think is a reasonable schedule for both ourselves, from a production standpoint, and the customers, from a deliver standpoint", "But having said that, we recognize that there are cost, contractual revenues that we will have to cover as it relates to the Canadian government and then we are going to also have fewer flight hours and we will probably going to have some cost on the program related to that longer time frame. So, really three pieces. There is some contractual relief cost, there is flight hour degradation and there is just some additional program cost and all that added up to the $157 million charge.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "So we still absorb whatever it is, $4 million a unit, as you ship those eight over the next three years. Correct?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, it's $14 million a year. Again, we should point out. We obviously can ship more than just the eight a year. We can probably deliver most of the helicopters this year. We just don\u2019t think that that\u2019s practical. I think Mick and the team have made some really good progress in the last month since Louis spoke. We have been discussions with the Canadian government and I think again, we will see some good news coming out of Mick in March.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "And just on share repurchase. You said, you started here in January. Obviously, the cash has been strong. You have a little bit more leash with the rating agencies try to at least fully arrest your creep in 2013 or potentially even go further than that?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, I think we will certainly be able to arrest share creep with the share buyback that we have got. As you know, we have got a placeholder of a $1 billion for share buyback this year and $1 billion for M&A. If I think about the cash, we are still going to see about $1.5 billion of cash proceeds coming in from these divestitures that will close here in the first half. We ended the year with strong cash flow. Over $5 billion on the balance sheet. We had strong cash flow for the year. So I think, if you think of the calls on cash, we have got $2 billion going to dividends, we have got $1 billion for share buyback, we have got $1 billion of debt that due in December, that\u2019s the 18-month flow and we will certainly be in a position to pay that. We will probably pay down another $1 billion of debt that\u2019s due in '15 or '16. Then we will talk to the rating agencies about taking up the number but I think cash looks very strong, certainly what we expected and of course my bosses is pushing me to do a lot more than $1 billion but it\u2019s January, so we will see what happens.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Then, just finally, and then I will move on. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the complexion of what you are seeing in Otis China whether it is primary city, secondary, cities, residential versus non and anything to add there about how things are playing out?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think, again, as we talked in December, where we are seeing the growth is in the Western provinces. Along the coast, the residential investments have picked up a little bit but the real strength we are seeing is on the residential side and I will say, the third and the fourth tier cities. This factory in Chongqing that we just opened in September of last year is probably fully utilized. We shipped about 10,000 units out of there this year. So that\u2019s where the growth is coming. It is from the west. It is nothing new. I think it is the same phenomenon we saw last year. But we are also seeing, I think just an uptick in the overall economy in China. It wasn\u2019t just Otis that was strong. CCS had a very good fourth quarter from an order rates perspective there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Just two questions, hopefully. One is, you talked about impairment charges in CC&S. Could you give us a ballpark idea of what you are close to selling or expensing with, so we can think about next year's base line in that business.", "Gregory Hayes", "(Inaudible), I think, we had a place holder of about $800 million of divestitures. I think, we got somewhere, Jay, about $550 of those?", "Jay Malave", "A little bit less than that. Yes.", "Gregory Hayes", "$500 million of that last year, so we still got a little bit to go I think, and we took a $65 million impairment charge on a number of some of the legacy F&S businesses, and I think as we laid all that out for you back in September in terms of the listing of those businesses. So, no surprises, I suspect most of the portfolio transformational probably done in the first half. Some of them will linger into the back half, but I think that they've got pretty good line of sight [all done] this year.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "IF we kind of look at what you have here, then, your 15% margin is almost the low hurdle not to give you too hard of time about that?", "Gregory Hayes", "You wouldn't be giving me a hard time about that if you were to say that, because I think again Carrier just based on their guidance is going to hit 15% this year, assuming markets comeback as we expect. So, the integration Carrier and F&S has come cross without a hit, so I think 15% ought to be very achievable if the markets cooperate.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "And then on Sikorsky, if we exclude all these, I know for accounting you can't exclude the $157 million, but for us we can back that out and you end up with something around 16% operating margins in the business unit. Was there just some catches and maybe some absence of R&D, and I know you sort of alluded to a lower decline year-on-year in the business. Could you talk a little bit about what I call core operating performance?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think, core operating actually very good of sequester that, 91 aircraft that we're going to look more for. It's a huge number of aircraft. I think they delivered 242 or so for the year and 91 of that was in the fourth quarter. So, lot of shipments again profitable and we saw good shipments on the commercial side, the S-92 is going out, we saw the S-76. I think, we delivered four of those in the quarter, so it's really just a very strong quarter end.", "If you recall, again, the operating performance in terms of profit growth was not very strong throughout the year, so really all the profit growth came in the fourth quarter.", "Jay Malave", "And I would just add, sort of add nice mix, good restructuring benefits and also just as a reminder, strong backlog as we go into 2013.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "So, some of its price and some of it is some permanent cost reduction?", "Gregory Hayes", "Right.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thanks, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Good morning, guys. Actually it's [Saffran] for Joe this morning. Two quick questions. Good morning. First of all, if there's anything you can say at this point and I know it's difficult about sort of the calendarization of the improvement in the aftermarket for 2013.", "Jay Malave", "Yes. I wish my crystal ball was clear on how do that calendarization is going to work. Obviously, we talked about kind of mid-single digit growth at Pratt & Whitney and it's about 10% of the Aerospace Systems' business.", "Obviously the order rates in the fourth quarter were still not positive, but they were a lot better. So, again, this is probably more back half than front half, but where we are seeing airline profitability continuing to improve, the trend line was good. As I said, book-to-bill was over 1%, but I am not sure if this is going to be a second quarter, or third quarter, but just given the cycles of the airlines are flying today, we know that there is going to be a recovery here some time whether it's second, third, fourth, I can't tell you.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks. And, just as a follow-up, is there anything else you can say now about the agreement you came to with Boeing on pursuing on the helicopter work?", "Jay Malave", "The team here is really, it's a win-win for UTC and Boeing. It teams us with Boeing. This is on the joint multi-role helicopter program. We'll be submitting the joint bid with Boeing here in March. This is for up to 4,000 helicopters. Again, this has developed a prototype. We won't actually deliver production helicopters for 10, 15 years, but this is a great team and it puts again Sikorsky is going to lead on the aircraft, Boeing will lead on the emission system equipment really capitalize on the strength of the both companies. And recall, this is not a new thing. We teamed with Boeing back 15 years ago when Comanche program was launched and we have a very good working relationship with between the two organizations.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Okay. Well, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Thanks. Good morning, Greg and Jay.", "Jay Malave", "Good morning, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Just a couple of questions. First, on the Pratt spares. It looks like your compare there would have eased a lot, but obviously there was still a lot of pressure there on the revenue side. I wondered if you might speak to from a platform level where that pressure is coming from and if you are seeing it in one area more than another maybe it is PW4000s versus what you are seeing in the Vs. But any color you can provide there on that continued weakness would be helpful.", "Gregory Hayes", "I think it is the same trend we have been talking about for the last four or five months. We continue to see weakness of the wide-body which is the PW4000 and we continue to see strength in the narrow-body which is the Vs and with the PW2000s and 757. We thought that 75s were going to start to see some acceleration of retirements. We haven\u2019t really sent that. In fact, they are flying more now. So, spares actually look pretty good on 75s and on the Vs and all of the weakness we are seeing, all the year-over-year decline is really in the 4000 family. So again, we know those wide-bodies are flying. Those are relatively new aircraft but we will see spares come back.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Okay, and that 4000 weakness, would you attribute that to cargo? Can you see that in the trends?", "Jay Malave", "A decent size of the 94-inch fleet is is cargo, Carter, but it difficult to tell exactly where it is coming from.", "Gregory Hayes", "We are surprised as we also looked at this. The cycles at a cargo aircraft are not much different than the cycles on the commercial side. So although we talked about cargo versus commercial and we, from a spare parts perspective, it doesn\u2019t make a heck of a lot of difference at the end of the day.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Okay, and on China, in your comments there about Otis, I wondered if you might comment about the sort of implied change in market share that you are looking at there relative to 2012. I mean, assuming you lost a couple of points to share and is that the plan to regain that, all of it, part of it, some of it. Any comment you can make there?", "Gregory Hayes", "I can make a lot of comments. I guess I would say just a couple of things. Obviously, we did lose share earlier in the year. I think we gained a lot of momentum in the third and then even more so in the fourth quarter. (inaudible) that I just talked about, we are gaining all of our lost share by the end of '13. I think we are well on track to do that. The market is very dynamic. We are breaking it down between social housing and residential and then you have got the factories and the office but in all of those markets, we have got a pretty good share. Again, the momentum coming out of the fourth quarter ought to continue into 2013.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Does the plan imply the Pedro hit cycle?", "Gregory Hayes", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, good morning. First one, I may have missed it, but did you comment on how Pratt spares organically were sequentially, Jay?", "Jay Malave", "We did not. They were, spares sequentially.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "I would say, Hamilton was up.", "Gregory Hayes", "They were down 21%, third to fourth.", "Jay Malave", "They were up. Are you talking about the rate of decline?", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Absolute.", "Jay Malave", "Yes, absolute, they were up. But you would always expect them to be up because of the price type of ordering activity that happens in the quarter.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then, Greg, on the contingency on taxes, it sounds like $0.04 that has been added to the contingency, Euro maybe $0.03 or $0.04 pension. Can you size that?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, it is another probably $0.05 or so.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, is that roughly the puts that you have and then you mentioned spares as being an unknown or aftermarket as being unknown. Is there anything else that is emerging that is being a more of a put to that $0.15 or $0.16 additional contingency?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, in fact, I think, surprisingly, it has been a pretty good start to the year. We feel a little bit better today than we did back in December because we have got this additional goal of $0.15 or $0.16 or plus we are taking up restructuring by about $100 million. So we feel good about the guidance range and again if the business unit hit their high end of their guidance range, we will certainly see ourselves towards the top-end of that range as opposed to the mid-point but at the mid-point we did not have much contingency and now we have got calling extra $0.15, $0.16 of contingency sitting there today. So we feel pretty good.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities", "Good morning. Can you talk a little about aerospace systems? If I just look at the 2013's guidance of $13.5 billion, $14 billion in revenues, and the $2.1 billion in operating profit, just looking at where you were in the fourth quarter which would have had a full quarter of Goodrich, I mean, certain it seems like you need to step up the run rate on a quarterly basis. And, outside of the 87, I mean what else is really going to help move that quarterly run rate up so much over the course of the year to hit those numbers?", "Jay Malave", "You got really two things that are going to benefit Aerospace Systems as we move throughout the year. One of course will be additional synergies and we have recognized about $60 million of synergies last year. This year we probably had another 100 plus million in synergies, maybe $120 million of synergies, so that will help the run rate and you've got a recovery in spares.", "The thing about what's holding margins down in the fourth quarter at Aerospace Systems, clearly the decline in spares year-over-year, so we if we get to that 10% spares up that we expect, plus we see the synergies. I think you will certainly an improvement in the run rate.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thank you. Then just CC&S, some of the other companies that have reported I guess the December quarter talked about some softening and some of the HVAC end market. I think it might have been more refrigeration, but just in general, have you seen any trends in any areas within the HVAC markets that might have been softening over the course of the quarter and into January?", "Gregory Hayes", "Well, let me go through it piece-by-piece, because obviously there's puts and takes in the CCS portfolio, but res as we mentioned ended very strongly 20% order up 10% in sales. Commercial HVAC globally was up about 7%, again, strong in North America, strong in Asia, not so good in Europe. I think, the one kind of governor of the year is going to be Transicold specifically, the container business which was still down in the fourth quarter and it's not clear that we are going to see a big recovery although we're certainly hopeful on the container market. Now, looking at the goods [indices] obviously that's still down at a relatively low level and it doesn't bode well for the containers, but it's a very cyclical business. So, containers were down and commercial refrigeration in Europe was also down year-over-year. Again, not much going on there in Europe, we are of course very strong there.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities", "What is interest guidance in terms of the container assumption for this year?", "Jay Malave", "Container is up, I believe about 15%.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Yes. Thank you very much. On the Canadian Maritime Helicopter, where are we in negotiations with the Canadian government. Are you in talks?", "Jay Malave", "Let me be very clear about this guy. I think we are in discussions with the Canadians. We have not entered into a renegotiation of the contract yet. We are in discussions to get to that point where we can restructure the deliveries of the IMH, which is the interim configuration of the helicopter. We started those discussions last year. I think they are going very well, but we are not at the point yet where we're ready to pencil to paper.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Okay. So, I mean obviously you've kind of had a lower number than expected at Sikorsky last year, but you bought the decline down a little bit, so I mean you feel better than you did in December about those discussions.", "Jay Malave", "I think, yes. Generally, we feel better in general about the relationship. I think we are making progress everyday up there. Mick and his team have been working very closely with the customer. It just takes time to work through all this.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Okay. Then help us understand maybe the tax rate, you took it down 50 bips, but you said what? There's 100 million plus from the R&D credit in the first quarter for 2012?", "Jay Malave", "Yes.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Another $100 million, so by $200 million benefit shouldn't that be a little bit more than 50 bips?", "Jay Malave", "Yes. In fact the benefit will be a little bit more in 2013 than we saw in 2012. Again, we've taken the rate down by a half of point, probably wanted to come down four-point, but this actually gives us an opportunity to make sure we actually hit that rate. And though, we have to do some tax planning to get from the statutory rate down to that target rate of 29.5%. This takes some pressure off of that and we'll see how the year goes. There's obviously a little, it helps a lot by having that R&D tax credit out there.", "Jay Malave", "Cai, the 2012 piece that we booked in the first quarter will reduce the reported rate. We've [inferred]the 29%, we're talking about the operational rate. And in that $100 million as Greg spoke to basically could be to offset the incremental restructuring against the $300 million. So, you are correct the reported rate will be lower than 29%.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "I guess, I didn't get that, so the reported rate will be lower than 29?", "Jay Malave", "Yes. The operator effective rate will be 29%, but because this 2012 extenders, it will be booked in the first quarter actually.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "No, I get that. Maybe you could also help us show where the rate to be in the first quarter and assuming the 2013 is equally spread, where should it be for the last nine months, approximately.", "Gregory Hayes", "In fact, what will happen is, to Jay's point, you are going to get this $100 million benefit on R&D in the first quarter. So the rate normally is going to be about 31% in the first quarter and it declines throughout the year as we implement tax plans and strategy. So this $100 million will help in the first quarter. I don\u2019t have an exact number. We will get back you on that. In fact, when we update you, I think sometime here coming up in February, when we can give you probably a better look at what that rate is going to be quarter-by-quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan from Nomura. Your line is open.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura Securities", "Good morning, Greg and Jay. Just a couple of things on cash flow. So CapEx jumped up in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what the focus there is, where they are and should we assume this kind of percentage of sales close to 4% as a run rate?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, let's talk a little bit about CapEx. I think we spent $641 million or $642 million on CapEx in the quarter and almost $1.4 billion for the year. That was up like $500 million, year-over-year. So, we saw that spending all over, but really it's on the aerospace side. As Pratt gears up for production of the GTF and as Hamilton Sundstrand, Goodrich businesses, as they gear up for this big increase in OEM production, we are seeing a lot of pressure on CapEx.", "At the same time, we also had spending on the commercial side of the business, I think Otis was up to $142 million. So that\u2019s up about $70 million year-over-year. So we are making investments around the business. I think we will continue to see pressure on CapEx that number wants to be higher in 2013 where we obviously have got a little work to do to hold that to a more reasonable level, but that $1.4 billion could well go up to $1.5 billion this year.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities", "Okay, so a little bit of an increase year-over-year but fourth quarter was a heavy quarter?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, in fact we didn\u2019t actually believe the forecast. It got rolled up because we have never seen a quarter that big before but the ramp is real. 787 production is going to go from seven to 10. You got A380 production increase. Really, across the aerospace platforms, you are seeing big increases and that just leaves the CapEx.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities", "Okay, and then just, where did you end the year on the funded status in terms of pension? You put in a $200 million in the international plans in the quarter. Any plans to contribute in 2013?", "Gregory Hayes", "We ended up about 85% funded. Again, we have had a very good year on the pension side. The returns were around 14% on the domestic side. We did put of a $200 million into international plans in the late December. We will probably put a similar number in this year. There is no U.S. contributions this year. None required this year and probably none for next year.", "So, again, the funded status, again, we have a good run-up but like we did last year it will correct itself plus and discounted rate helped us a little bit at the end at 3.9 versus the 3.8. So, still long way to go from where it\u2019s been historically, but I think all those factors point to the need for very little funding.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Strauss from UBS. Your line is open.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Good morning, Jay and Greg. On Goodrich, it came in a little bit better than you guys forecast, $0.06 dilution. It looks like synergies were a little bit better. It also sounds like, in response to Sam's question, you are now forecasting a little bit higher synergy number for '13. Did anything else for the Goodrich forecast in terms of accretion change for '13?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, we are still looking at $0.60 of accretion year-over-year. You would get about $1.2 billion of EBIT and you get the synergies and offset that and then you get $90 million or so of amortization. So, none of that has really changed the restructuring. It is still about $100 million. Maybe the one nuance in this is that $0.60 of accretion includes a $100 million of restructuring, and we will cover that $100 million of restructuring at the top level. So, the real number you are going to see is probably more like $0.68 of accretion year-on-year.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Okay, and then CCS. Given what you are seeing today, back at the meeting in December, you had talked about the underlying assumptions there being about mid-single digit growth in resi volumes and mid-single digit growth on the commercial side. Does that still hold today?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes. I think so. But again, order rate would seem to support those numbers coming into the year and I don\u2019t think there has been any change to those base assumptions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Jay Malave", "Hello.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Just wanted to try to dig into the commercial aftermarket broadly again. It looks like we could see airlines de-stocking inventory throughout 2012. You guys have talked about this dollar cost per shop visit being under pressure. It sounds like things are getting a little better there, but that behavior isn't really changing. And, Greg, you mentioned, flight hours are growing in a nice clip. Airline profitability is pretty solid relative to prior cycles. Can you just sort of elaborate on when you are talking to the customer, why are they behaving that way? What's making them do that? It seems like often times to answer that question is just broader macro and broader uncertainty, but that was true. That's been true for four year now and there have been pockets of inventory restock and destock, and why are they doing that now and then what is that that will make them stop so that they try and reverse this?", "Jay Malave", "Yes. I think what will make them stop is the shelves barely won't be able to dispatch aircraft, so it is a very cyclical business. You go back to 2009 and we saw spares down 25%. It came back in '10 and '11 and like last year again there was a lot of uncertainty from a macro standpoint. What's going in Europe, we saw a big reduction in the European airlines order rates, U.S. uncertainty. Again, a slowdown in China, all of those macro factors I think impacts the airlines' perception of how much do I need to order, how much stock do I need to have. It will come back. I mean, it is a very cyclical business. And, as I said earlier, I am not sure if this is first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, but we know typically these cycles run 12 to 18 months, where they have to come in and buy parts.", "The good news is as we go to this next generation of aircraft, more than 80% of our customers are electing to go on some type of an FMP, so it will take the volatility out of this eventually, but today that number is less than 40%, so we are still seeing revenues today, we're just not seeing an incremental piece from all of these flight hours that are out there.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "And you don't have the data on what the customer holds to give you a little bit more precision on when they do have the shelves bare and need to start restocking?", "Jay Malave", "Well, keep in mind, there's a couple of different phenomenon. Here at Pratt, we know pretty is going into the which engines are going to come off wing and which for overhaul and how many inductions we should be seeing in our shop and we'll know that within 10%. What we don't know when we do that forecast is what level of overhaul the customer is going to ask for order is it light or heavy. So, the scope again that's just short of the interval between overhaul cycles.", "Now the Hamilton and Goodrich size is little different. Those are primarily on condition repairs, where something breaks they have to fix it, but there is no time based overhaul, so that\u2019s another business. I think that's why the Hamilton business is down nearly as much as the Pratt business, because again as things break on plant they have to fix them, but they still have some ability to work out or to use up the spears that they have in stock.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's very helpful. And just one other question on the separate topic, Otis margins, can you just elaborate on whether or not the margin in the quarter, or how the margin in the quarter compared to what you thought it would be. And, I know you have 2013 guidance that shows a little bit of improvement there. Is there any change to the longer term a few years down the road thought on what the right margin is in that segment, particularly as you start to take that market share back?", "Gregory Hayes", "Obviously, there is no surprises in terms of the fourth quarter. We knew margins will come down about 110 basis points, I guess, which is just where I think Pedro had calibrated us for the fourth quarter. And this year margins will go up a little bit again what we expect to see a recovery in equipment sales and we expect to see stabilization in Europe.", "I think the margins are 23%, we probably aren't going to see those again anytime soon. And that was really because new equipment sales were down so much in the aftermath of this great recession, so as new equipment comes back to kind of more normal 55% and 60% of revenue. If it goes back to 55%. We should see again probably those margins maybe 20% to 21% range long-term.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks a lot. Yes. So, my first question is just on the overall UTC-wide organic sales growth. It's flat in Q4, flat in 2012. The midpoint is up 4% for 2013. We are looking at the four main order numbers that you always call out, half were down, half are up. So without getting to sort of bulk down a little, if we are getting commercial aftermarket forecasting, when do you think the overall UTC-wide entity will start to see decent organic sales growth? Will we have to wait till Q2 or Q3, or you think Q1 will start to see some growth again?", "Gregory Hayes", "I would expect you will see modest growth in the first quarter and then it should accelerate as the year progresses. Again if you think about the CCS business, it's obviously seasonal as well. So second and third quarters are typically stronger than first quarter, but what you will see is a gradual resumption in organic revenue growth. Last year was clearly an anomaly for UTX. It's been a dozen years since we have seen sales growth at that level.", "So, we are well positioned in the emerging markets. I think China is going to come back strong this year, after a weak last year. We have seen that in the order rates at both CCS and Otis. Again, commercial OEM will be strong. We know that the backlog is very strong there. Sikorsky, again down a little bit on the Black Hawks, but commercial business is doing well. So, spares is probably the big question mark in terms of whether that's a first, second or third quarter recovery, but I would expect just a gradual recovery in organic growth, but we should see some in the first quarter.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Got it, thanks. Then just to circle back quickly on Otis. You mentioned earlier in the call that Europe, in some areas, was stabilizing. It doesn't sound like that had happened in HVAC or in Aerospace. So does that mean you have already seen some stabilization in Otis Europe?", "Gregory Hayes", "Again, you have to look at it almost country-by-country as we go across Europe. Obviously Spain was down big, Italy was down big, France was relatively flat. Then we saw decent growth in Russia and the emerging Europe. So again, parts of Europe are okay. Other parts are, I would say, still in the doldrums. But again Spain has stabilized. It's not getting worse. Italy has stabilized, not getting worse. So, it's at low level and we should see a gradual recovery. We are not expecting much this year. Remember we are talking two or three points of growth out of Europe after a down two years.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Got it, and pricing in Otis. Obviously you had some changes in strategy in China in the spring of last year. So now Otis sort of region by region the pricing strategy is unchanged?", "Gregory Hayes", "Again, there is a pricing pressure across the globe in the Otis business. We see it especially in China and we also see it in Europe. We are actually seeing pricing get a little bit better here in North America, but it's a fight every day.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning. I was interested if you could give a little insight into the CC&S margins. Good margins, but if you were to separate what's caused the improvement in terms of, say, mix, commodity cost, and the benefits of the integration, exit from lower performing businesses, and you did give us a special dividend. How would you give those puts and takes?", "Jay Malave", "Let me just talk about the growth, because the growth in the quarter was essentially, as we said, the restructuring benefits, you had some improvement in commodities, and then you had the dividends. As far as the operating margin, you do get some, and we have talked in the past, about a third of the benefit comes from the portfolio transformation. But again a lot of that is the heavy lifting that they have done related to the consolidation and the restructuring that they have done and continue to do over the past number of years. So that's mainly the big drivers of their operating margin expansion.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "And how much was it in reduced commodity cost?", "Jay Malave", "Commodities wasn't much, Doug, but I can get back to you on that.", "Gregory Hayes", "It wasn't the biggest driver. If you think about it, restructuring is probably the biggest, followed by special dividend out there and then we would get down to commodity pricing.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then on Otis, now that orders, you have seen some pickup in orders, in terms of lead time today, what do you see in terms of when that would turn into sales?", "Jay Malave", "Yes. Market-by-market, it will vary. Typically, in China, we are seeing about a six to nine month lead time from order to delivery. The U.S., especially some of the big megaprojects or even in the U.K. like this cross-rail project, we won't be delivering those for a couple of years. So, again, the U.S. orders are all 18 to 24 months as opposed to Asia which is typically a much shorter cycle.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "And then have you seen any changes in the competitive behavior here with regard to pricing?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes. I think again as I mentioned before, pricing is difficult in all of the markets. I don't think that we are seeing any changes per se, but it is a very difficult pricing environment in all of these markets. Again, as orders pickup, obviously some of that pressure abates, but it is still a very, very competitive market out there.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.", "Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Greg and Jay. Just more of a clarification on the restructuring, Greg, the additional $100 million that you picked up here where exactly is that going to fall? Is it in the Goodrich comments that you've mentioned earlier about covering the restructuring costs there, or is it placed in CC&S?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think, in fact, what you'll see is that $100 million of restructuring that we had at UTAS or at the Aerospace Systems, that is unchanged from December. What we've seen is really both at Otis and at Pratt & Whitney is a desire for more restructuring dollars. They've got projects that they're working on both, domestically and internationally where there are looking for some restructuring dollars.", "Again, we see really good payback. This is one to two year payback kind of projects and the list is longer than my funding ability right now, so again I think you'll see it just like you did last year across each of the businesses.", "Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee", "Okay. Then just for clarification going back to your EPS kind of walk that you laid out in December. It sounds like we are going to have a little bit less the headwind here for Sikorsky given the charge and pension came in a little better in a slightly lower tax rate is the midpoint still is intact because of the additional restructuring? Is that a fair way to look at it?", "Gregory Hayes", "No. I think the midpoint is intact and we've got a little more contingency. The $100 million of additional restructuring is actually covered by the tax extenders from 2012. Because we got them in January, they come through in the first quarter of this year, so I'm going to take that $100 million of kind of good news and we are just going to use it to fund additional restructuring.", "The other good news like the tax rate from the 2013 extenders, plus the good news on pension, FX and all that, that just really gives us more contingency at the midpoint and we are not going to take the guidance up, because of that good news today but certainly we feel better about where we are than we did even a month ago.", "Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee", "Okay. Understood. Thank you.", "Gregory Hayes", "All right. Thank you, everyone. I appreciate you guys listening in on the call. We'll see everybody in March at our Annual Investor Meeting [your presence] and look forward to talking to all of you.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do. Then company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may also ask further questions by reinserting yourself in the queue and we will answer as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thank you [Shamie] and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, UTC reported first quarter earnings per share of $1.39, that\u2019s up 6% versus 2012 and a little higher than we expected due to a little better than expected execution at Aerospace Systems and our Climate, Controls and Security business, as well at the time with some one-time gains. If you recall back in March, we were talking about a $1.30 number that we\u2019re comfortable with. In fact on that $1.30, we had about $0.05 of gains in excess of restructuring. We ended up with $0.11. So about $0.06 of the $1.39 was a little bit more than we expected at the timing of some gains out of the portfolio that integrate the portfolio at CCS. As far as rest of the business, our integration remains on track and we continue to see strong performance in our two major acquisitions with Goodrich and IAE providing $0.21 of earnings in the quarter.", "Organic sales declined 2%, partially due to tough compares in commercial aerospace aftermarket and the Transicold business. But we continue to see signs of economic recovery, especially in North America and emerging markets. Europe, however, continues to be a headwind and the legacy PW4000 commercial spares at Pratt & Whitney have yet to recover. So the past could be a bit even, but we\u2019re confident in our full year outlook.", "On slide two, on a positive note, order trends that you see on slide two indicate that the majority of our portfolio is well positioned for a resumption of top-line growth, as we progress through the remainder of the year. Just a reminder, we\u2019ll talk to orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. In our commercial businesses, we see good traction in North America. The housing and commercial construction markets are improving, Americans are investing in their homes again, and our North American Residential HVAC orders were up 11% versus last year. The ABI or the architecture of billing indices has now trended above 50 for the past seven months and we see that coming through in our orders and Otis new equipment orders up 21% in North America.", "We did see a 12% decline on our North American Commercial HVAC orders, this is on a tough compare and we continue to expect that business to grow 2% to 4% for the year. As I mentioned, Europe remains a challenge, although we do see some bright spots. CCSs commercial refrigeration business, their orders grew 11% in Europe and Otis new equipment orders grew 21% with Russia, France and the UK more than offsetting weakness in Southern Europe. However CCSs commercial HVAC and Fire & Security products orders were down 14% and 5% respectively, so we\u2019re not quite out of the woods in Europe yet. Otis continues to gain momentum in China, holding on the strength we saw on the fourth quarter, orders were up 27% in Q1, CCS commercial HVAC orders were down slightly, while the fire and security product orders grew 8% in China. Our position in emerging markets continues to pay off with combined BRIC orders for the commercial businesses up 22%, in the quarter.", "Turning to aerospace we saw a modest improvement in our commercial aftermarket business at Aerospace Systems', spares orders were up 2% on a pro forma basis would strength primarily from the legacy Goodrich business, however we yet to see a recovery of Pratt & Whitney, legacy commercial spare orders were down 28%, continued declines in wide-body PW4000 orders were partially offset by strong growth in the V2500.", "The rate of decline also reflects a tough compare to last year and a strong book-to-bill in the fourth quarter, with increasing airline traffic, record load factors, declining oil prices and airlines projected to earn more than $10 billion this year, we still expect an increase in order rates as we move through the year.", "On the military side although we didn\u2019t see a significant impact for the sequestration, we do see the impact of DOD budget cuts and reduction in flying hours, with aggregate pro forma aftermarket sales down 10% in the quarter across the Aero businesses. So we will keep a close eye on the aerospace aftermarket and look for signs of more stabilization in Europe, but order rates and macroeconomic trends broadly support our assumption for growth as we move through the year. We remain confident on our full year guidance of earnings per year of $5.85 to $6.15 and sales of $64 billion to $65 billion, that\u2019s up 3% to 5% organically.", "Okay, now onto slide three, taking a closer look at first quarter results, total sales and segment operating profit increased 16% and 15% respectively driven by the Goodrich and IAE acquisitions. Climate, Controls and Securities continues to realize savings from the integration, as they increase profit 8%, out of 3% decline in organic sales. And Otis continues to gain momentum with organic sales growth for the second consecutive quarter.", "EPS of $1.39, as I said before, included a $0.11 of gains in excess of restructuring. About $0.15 of combined gains came from the tax adjustments related to the 2012 Tax Extenders, which were passed by Congress in January of 2013, and the ongoing portfolio transformation at CCS. These gains were partially offsets by $0.04 of restructuring. Excluding these items, as well as $0.21 of net gains from last year\u2019s first quarter, an earnings per share increased 16%, again driven by the IAE and Goodrich acquisitions.", "Free cash flow in the quarter was 88% of net income. CapEx was $295 million, that\u2019s up nearly 60% versus last year, as we prepare for the ramp in commercial aerospace. We also restarted our share repurchase program in January, acquiring $335 million of our stock and we expect to buyback at similar amount here in the second quarter.", "Let me stop there for now and I\u2019ll talk more about the full-year in just a second, but first let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the segment results.", "Jay Malave", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to page four, Otis sales improved 2% in the quarter led by solid mid-single digit growth in new equipment and continued growth in service sales. Excluding the impact of currency, new equipment sales were up in the Americas, Europe and Asia, with North America, Russia and China leading the way. Operating profit was essentially flat at constant currency. Continued weakness in Southern Europe offset the benefits of volume growth and continued cost reduction in the rest of the world. New equipment order growth was strong, up 24% in the quarter with double-digit growth in the Americas, Europe, and Asia led by 27% improvement in China.", "Order strength in Russia more than offset weakness in Southern Europe. Thanks to the growing order book and near-term completion of factory transformations around the world. Otis expects to see improving performance as the year progresses. Guidance for the full year remains unchanged with profit expected to be up $150 million on mid single-digit sales growth.", "On slide 5, climate, controls & security increase profits 8% in the quarter and 7% lower sales resulting in another sharp increase in margins, up 170 basis points from prior year to 13.1%. Organic sales were down 3%, driven by a steep decline in container shipments. On a difficult prior year compare complaint with weak European markets, partially offset by high single-digit growth in the Americas residential HVAC business. China was up low single digits, while Asia overall was flattish.", "CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth, despite with the decline in order organic sales. Profit growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including continued savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security, lower commodity cost and the absence of ongoing losses from a business we divested in the first quarter last year.", "Global commercial HVAC orders were down 8%, following 9% growth last year with double-digit declines in North America and Europe partially offset by low single-digit growth in Asia. Orders for global Fire & Security products were down low single-digit and fuel [premises] were down about 10%.", "Transicold orders were up 30% and Commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were up a 11%, with solid results in the first quarter and anticipated organic improvement we continue to expect a profit growth of $150 million to $200 million on mid single-digit organic sales growth at CCS.", "Turning to aerospace on slide six. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 11% in the first quarter, driven by the consolidation of IAE and the transfer of the AeroPower business. Organic sales were down 2% year-over-year as declines in commercial aftermarket and military businesses were partially offset by higher commercial engine OEM and Power Systems sales. Large commercial spare sales were down 19% organically over last year\u2019s first quarter, which was the strongest of 2012. On a reported basis, large commercial spares were up 23% including consolidated IAE sales.", "Operating profit in the quarter was down 3%. The impact from lower organic volume and unfavorable mix along with higher pension costs was partially offset by the benefits from the IAE consolidation, lower E&D and restructuring savings. The quarter also benefited from a partnership settlement and contract closeouts, which more than offset the absence of last year\u2019s contract closeout benefit. For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney\u2019s operating profit to be up $100 million to $150 million, a mid to high single digit sales growth.", "UTC Aerospace Systems delivered a solid quarter with operating profit of $509 million and sales of $3.3 billion. As Greg mentioned, Goodrich has gotten off to a better than expected start and contributed $0.18 earnings per share in the quarter. On a pro forma year-over-year basis for UTC Aerospace Systems, sales were up low single-digit with commercial OEM up high single-digit, partially offset by weakness in military aftermarket.", "Commercial aftermarket sales were up low single-digit. Orders for commercial spares grew 2% on a pro forma year-over-year basis, and commercial spares book-to-bill exceeded 1 for the second straight quarter.", "Compared with the fourth quarter which was a first full quarter with Goodrich Aerospace Systems' sales were up 3% and operating profit was up 50%. Operating profit growth was driven by about $90 million, purchase accounting related adjustments, conversion on higher OEM and commercial aftermarket sales volumes as well as lower E&D. With a solid start to the year we remain confident in full-year guidance with the sales of $13.5 billion, $14 billion and operating profit of $2.1 billion.", "Turning to Sikorsky on slide 8, sales declined 7% driven by lower military aircraft and aftermarket volumes, partially offset by higher commercial aircraft deliveries. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 40 aircraft including 30 military and 10 commercial. Operating profit declined 32% as a result of the lower overall sales volumes. Headwind from the Multi-Year 8 margin reset and higher pension cost.", "During the quarter Sikorsky and Boeing signed a strategic teaming agreement support the U.S. Army\u2019s Joint Multi-Role Future Vertical Lift requirements, the joint effort includes proposal to build a demonstrative aircraft based on Sikorsky\u2019s X2 technology. For the full-year we continued to expect profit to be down $100 million to $150 million on low single-digit sales growth.", "With that let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thanks Jay. We are on slide 9 now it\u2019s a good execution at the business units as we look to further end market recovery as the year progresses, the businesses as we said are focused on integration and execution, as we wrap up the final pieces of the portfolio transformation.", "In the first quarter we closed on the sale of the two regulatory mandated divestitures from Goodrich along with our fuel cells business. We expect the last two large divestitures that\u2019s Pratt & Whitney Power System and Rocketdyne businesses to close by the middle of the year, and CCS should have their portfolio transformation essentially complete by the end of this year. We also had several notable accomplishments in the first quarter that will drive organic growth well into the future. On our first GTF engine, the Bombardier CSeries, we achieved flight certification, while the first A320neo engine completed ground testing and will begin flight testing here in the second quarter.", "We also had significant wins across the Propulsion and Aerospace Systems group in this quarter, most notably at Embraer. With the selection of the GTF to power Embraer\u2019s second generation E-Jet, Pratt & Whitney is well-positioned on the next generation regional jets, a key growth market over the next 20 years. We also want a new position for wheels and brakes at Embraer. The combine wins across the Embraer regional jet show the value we bring to our customers and are early examples of the benefit of the Goodrich acquisition. As Jay mentioned, Sikorsky and Boeing announced the partnership to submit a joint proposal for the Army\u2019s Joint Multi-Role, Technology Demonstrator and that\u2019s going to be based on Sikorsky\u2019s X2 technology, Sikorsky also took orders for 15 commercial helicopters in the quarter.", "On the CMH program, we continue to have discussions with our customers, but there is really nothing new to report at this time. We remain committed to the program and are already to begin pilot training and we\u2019re going to maintain our place holder, eight aircraft deliveries for 2013. In the commercial businesses, we continue to win orders in key emerging markets. Otis\u2019s 27% order growth in China, including order for a 151 elevators in a high-end luxury residential complex near Shanghai, and CCS was awarded a contract to provide two datacenters in China with HVAC, fire suppression and chiller control systems. So just as you heard from the presence in March, each of our businesses is well-positioned on our core markets and continued innovation will allow us to drive long-term organic growth.", "Okay, taking a look at the rest of 2013, no real changes from what we told you last month. We remain confident in our guidance range of $5.85 to $6.15, despite the potential $0.10 impact for the sequestration. The order rates in our commercial businesses are good leading indicators for resumption of organic growth and we will keep a close eye on commercial spares as well as the European market.", "We\u2019ll also see some easier comparison over the course of the year. If you recall that the last year Pratt & Whitney\u2019s organic spare sales were down only 4% in the first quarter versus 19% decline over the rest of the year. And Transicold entered 2012 with a very strong backlog in the container business, which they burn down in last year\u2019s first quarter and this was followed by double-digit sales declines in each of the next three quarters.", "So you should see CCS revert to organic growth here in Q2. A, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in restructuring, with visibility, some additional gains and good payback restructuring factors across the business. We now expect to spend about $350 million on restructuring this year, all of which will be offset by one-time gains. We spent $52 million on restructuring in the first quarter and we would expect that to be level loaded with about a $100 million of restructuring in each of the next three quarters. Remaining gains however should come largely in the second quarter, so on top of the $185 million of gains you saw on Q1, we\u2019ll see about a $150 million to $160 million of gains here in the second quarter.", "Also strong cash flow remains a hallmark of UTC and we continue to expect free cash flow will equal or exceeds net income for the year. In the first quarter, we paid down almost $400 million of debt and we bought back $335 million of shares on maintaining the cash balance of $4.8 billion. We will continue to delever and we now expect to paid down about $2 billion of debt this year, $1 billion that we will target for here in the second quarter and the other $1 billion which is due in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re also going to maintain for the time being our placed order of $1 billion each for share repurchase and M&A, so, no surprises. The UTC portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of the megatrends of urbanization in commercial aerospace growth over the next decade. As always we\u2019re going to remain focused on integration and execution in 2013 and on your strategy to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth.", "With that let me stop. We\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Shamie?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Ronald Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hey, Ron, how are doing?", "Jay Malave", "Good morning, Ron.", "Ronald Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Good, quick question on the PW4000. I would say they were down I guess organically a bunch in the quarter. Why would they come back? I mean are the (inaudible)? What do you expect to see to have that actually come back?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "What, we know you\u2019re going to ask that question, Ron. Yeah, look it\u2019s a complicated story, let me try and take you through some of the pieces as we see it today. Right now, there\u2019s about 2500 PW4000 engines in services. And over the last five years that\u2019s come down in total about 3%. And we expect that that\u2019s going to continue to come down 1% or 2% a year for the next five years. So you\u2019re actually going to see some attrition in the portfolio, but at the same time, the average age of these engines is only 14 years. We fully expect these things to have a normal lifecycle of 25 years to 30 years, so at some point they will come back.", "There is some excess material out there in the, of engines obviously from some of the retirements, but just not significant enough, so they will come back for LLCs, we will start to see a more normal run rate here as we go throughout the year, so pretty confident, the other thing just to put it in perspective, so there is 2,500 4000s out there. Today there are 5,000 V2500s out there. We are going to sell another 3,000 engines over the next five years or so. So the Vs are really going to be the story going forward and we saw that in the quarter, if you dissect that 28% down, what you see is that the 4000s were down about just under 40% maybe they were down about 39%, but the Vs on the other hand were up about 34% on the legacy piece. So again I think we\u2019ve made this bet on narrow-body it\u2019s going to pay-off, and again I think it\u2019s all manageable in terms of what we are seeing on the 4000s in over the course of the year.", "Ronald Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. Okay and then maybe if I can just a follow-on that same question. So are you seeing I mean relatively young or engines would not [have] many hours on them, relatively speaking coming off airplanes that are getting retired computing with your own spares, maybe about kind of part of the issue?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "Not really. In fact, what we are seeing again, these engines have been out there, I think there is some engines that are 25 years old and the PW4 is in fact more than that, probably from the almost 30 years old, from the early 4000 so, sort of the older engines are coming off which is providing service to the material, we also see the airlines continuing to try and take spare engines and use them and not induct them into the overhaul shaft, so inductions actually on the 4000 are lighter than what we had expected just because the airlines are trying to do what they can to conserve cash, so oil prices at $90 a barrel, I think the airline traffic is still very high, capacity very high, you really think that we are going to see kind of return to normal on the 4000s, it\u2019s just not enough engines out there in the fleet that have been retired to provide enough spares to support the fleet that\u2019s out there.", "Ronald Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Ron thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hi Sam.", "Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "The first thing is can you just quantify the partnership settlement and contract closeouts in Pratt and how much that helped?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah. So, last year, there was a, I guess, some contract closeouts that gave us a benefit of about $0.02. This year, we\u2019ve got contract closeouts and a couple of other things which benefit us between $0.04 and $0.05, let\u2019s say, so kind of a net $0.03 year-over-year benefit at Pratt.", "Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And then just talk about lower E&D of Pratt and also UTC Aerospace Systems. E&D is coming down. And so I\u2019m just trying to just understand how come R&D is up year-over-year from $5.44 to $6.10? Where is that additional spending going?", "Jay Malave", "Well and that\u2019s the just function of Goodrich, I mean, sorry, Sam that\u2019s just the function of the Goodrich acquisition year-over-year, just consolidating the results versus last year they weren\u2019t in the results in the first quarter.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "And that was about a $100 million of that. So Pratt at least come down, I think $34 million of is well on track, it come down to $75 million to $100 million. The CSeries, as we said that\u2019s certified, in neo is going to flight test here shortly. So, you will see a real ramp down in the E&D and Pratt as we move through the year.", "Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Sam.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hi, Joe.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan", "The first question is just back on the Pratt spares. I heard everything you said. Could you quantify, I mean your confidences are going to come back. Are you able to quantify what would you believe is the new normal level for this and where are we relative to that? So how much under the long run level of PW4000 do you think we\u2019re running?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, obviously, we are down 40% this year in the first quarter to 39% and that will get better. Again we had a very tough compare last year and some strong sales of the 4000 and some LLCs that the drop of last year\u2019s first quarter. I think that rate that we saw its down 15% last year, we think that kind of the normalized rate that we saw in the third and the fourth quarter of last years the same rate that we saw this year in the first quarter and that rate should pick up again, we still have the airlines out differ in maintenance and just not to the indications over the shaft, so at some point these are going to come back.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan", "And do you think you\u2019re still on track for overall 5% organic growth in Pratt spares?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, but I think the mix is going to be different, I think the 2000s have held up pretty well, we saw good orders there the Vs have been better than what we expected on the legacy side and the 4000s are little weaker, but I still think, with the price increase and everything else that we see out there, we can still get to that 5%, we might be a little late to that if the 4000s don\u2019t come back at all, but if you see strength in the rest of the portfolio there.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay and then just one more Greg, overall organic growth you\u2019re still saying 3% to 5%, you are minus 2% in Q1. What do you think the profile will like over the rest of the year and did you expect Q1 to be minus 2% or are you thinking more like flat before?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, I think when we were, as we were looking at the year back in December, I think we saw kind of a flattish first quarter came in a little bit late there, again I think CCS we knew that the issues that we\u2019re going to see there because of the big compare issue on container, we knew Sikorsky was going to be down and we didn\u2019t expect spares of Pratt to be down as much as they were in the quarter. So that\u2019s a little bit of it, but again, I think it\u2019s generally you are going to see a gradual recovery, we\u2019ll see organic growth in the second quarter and it will pickup through the course of the year end, again and what I am looking at is order intake, especially at the commercial businesses as we saw very strong growth in China but we also saw a growth in Europe that obviously up 21% and North America is pretty good. So again, there is momentum with a backlog it\u2019s growing and we should see that play out in the higher sales as we move through the year.", "Jay Malave", "Yeah, Joseph, when we did see sequential growth in the backlog at both CCS and Otis new equipment, so that gives us some confidence as we go throughout the year, besides just the compare is getting easier.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, Joe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Thank you very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning, Howard.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Good morning gentlemen.", "Jay Malave", "Good morning.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "For a moment just to follow a little bit more on Joe\u2019s question with the diversified business the way you have, you always have some puts and takes. Where else did you see some things outside of the 4,000 that surprised you on the downside and where we\u2019re maybe some strength that you hadn\u2019t planned for?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, I think there is a one thing I would say; it\u2019s hard to say it surprises us. We knew Europe was going to be weak. The order rates at CCS on the commercial leaseback side were probably a little weaker and we didn\u2019t see any real traction of a service side of the business from the F&S business in Europe either but I would say that\u2019s a real surprise maybe we have hoped, I think as [Geraud] had talked about kind of 1% to 3% growth in Europe this year has markets. Again, I think we did see good growth in truck trailer in Europe and we\u2019ll saw a good growth in truck trailer in North America. But so there are pockets of goodness in Europe, it\u2019s not as dire as people might think. I mean we\u2019ve get good balance across the portfolio. So even if service of CCS has down, I think with truck trailer up. If there is nothing really out there, then I would say it\u2019s a big, big concern as we move through the year.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "And then you\u2019ve outlined to some degree what you think the gains and also where the restructuring is going to be? Could you provide a little more color on that or a little granularity?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "Sure, of the restructuring actions?", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Yes, please.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So, again, we have identified about \u2013 but we probably identified more than $350 million of potential actions. And we\u2019re going to see that as you would expect both at CSS, at Otis, we\u2019re going to see some more at Pratt. In the Aerospace Systems group, we have the Goodrich integration, is going well, but there is a about a $100 million of restructuring we\u2019ll do there, even Sikorsky is, as they see volumes down on military, you\u2019ll see some restructuring. For the most part, the programs that we\u2019re looking at today are paybacks between one and two year. So as they do that, as they take out their restructuring to $350 million that actually gives us a little bit of cushion this year, as well as a runway next year. So, again I think, there will be the typical actions, we\u2019re looking to move to low cost sourcing, we\u2019re looking to make sure that we will right size the business. And we know cuts are coming on the military side, we\u2019ve seen that already in the after market. So we\u2019re going to right size the business for what we see as the market demand, especially on the military aerospace side.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "And then your gains you said, can you just qualify them?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "The gains, I think we had a $185 million in the first quarter, a biggest piece I think. It\u2019s funny to call it a gain, but that was from the Tax Extenders package, that was the R&D tax credit for 2012 that got passed in 2013. But I\u2019m sure there\u2019s great policy to them, instead of us to spend in 2012 and 2013, that\u2019s another story. The other piece of that was portfolio transformation. We sold the Hong Kong guarding business at CCS. Those are the two gains. And in the second quarter we see gains on the divestitures that we\u2019ve got out there as well as a little bit of additional good news on taxes.", "Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies", "Thank you, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks, Howard. (Inaudible).", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Jay Malave", "Hi, Carter.", "Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays", "", "Just a couple quick ones, one, I wondered if you might expand a bit on Europe and maybe quantify how much Europe was down on the quarter in the commercial businesses and just what you saw in terms of the progression of orders over the quarter you know, March relative to February relative to January, this seems to be a pretty significant slowdown there. So, I wondered if you might be able to provide some color on that.", "Jay Malave", "Sales, I\u2019ll start with sales Carter and I\u2019ll get into orders, sales at Otis were up low single digit, sales at CCS were down high single digit. It was pretty much across the board we had the clients at commercial HVAC, we had the high single digits clients at commercial refrigeration, and we have declines in the fire and security businesses. And the orders as we said Otis was up 20% in the quarter and CCS was a little bit mix as Gregg said or as I said before commercial refrigeration was up 11%. Transport refrigeration in Europe was up over 20% HVAC was down mid teens and F&S that was also down, I think in around mid single digit.", "But again, none of this was a surprise we have build this and we\u2019re, we\u2019ve had Europe as pretty much the headwind go for the rest of the year and I think said it already in the guidance.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, and we also said there was no big trend change during the quarter, we\u2019re all of a sudden things just went to hell in a handbasket and we think it was simply kind of a continuation of what we saw throughout all of last year. Southern Europe reaming weaker than Northern Europe and emerging Europe especially Russia, being a lot better in probably the biggest growth opportunity, but we saw growth in the U.K. We saw growth in Germany it was not just across the board bad news.", "Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays", "", "That\u2019s great color, thanks, and just a quick follow up on the Goodrich increase you call about $0.18 in the quarter obviously that tracks to a bigger accretion number than you were outlining for the year at $0.60, you also called out a $90 million in purchase accounting adjustments did that impact Q1 in particular way that may that larger or how should we be thinking about Goodrich accretion over the course of the year relative to what your figures guide towards?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "Yeah. I think yeah Goodrich did do a little bit better than what we had expected, and that\u2019s surprising trying to under promising over deliver here on the biggest acquisition we\u2019ve ever done, but Goodrich is been nothing but good news for us. And again I contribute that really to the Aerospace Systems team down they\u2019ve been doing a great job integrating the business and got great people. And again taking care of the problems as they find them and that having any big surprise and so again a little bit better in first quarter and I would hope that trend would continue to again, just thinking about this balance works team here again a little bit of upside on Aerospace Systems this year could offset a little bit weakness on the commercial spares, so on the latest business the Propulsion and Aerospace Systems did pretty good about the guidance we\u2019ve got.", "Carter Copeland -- Barclays", "That\u2019s great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "", "Thank you good morning gents, just\u2026", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning, brother.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "", "Couple of other follow ups. Just back to Otis the strength in both Europe and China I guess in both cases do you think there is some share gain going on there or the markets really that strong, and I guess in China. If could provide some color on what\u2019s going on in the pricing environment?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, so in China I think the market is very, very strong I don\u2019t want to think that there is been were actually big gain in share because as we saw Conair reported this morning they\u2019ve also had very good results in China. And the market in China is very strong, I think property transactions in the first quarter we\u2019re up 60% in China. So again the markets are lot better than what we had anticipated. We saw that starting in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re also getting traction I think in China with the new products, we\u2019ve got the new low cost Gen2 for social housing. We\u2019ve tailored the products to that market. So again we\u2019re getting good traction but I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re gaining share necessarily, but it certainly feels pretty good when you have orders up 27%. As for Europe, again, it was a mixed bag against strength in the UK, strength in Russia, I think we\u2019re obviously, we\u2019re probably gaining share there, also strengthen in the Middle East, but Southern Europe continues to be kind of a drag and that\u2019s really more about the service side than it is new equipment. There really isn\u2019t much of a new equipment market in Southern Europe today.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "And I just didn\u2019t totally understand what Jay said, when he was talking about container orders. I wasn\u2019t sure if he said offer up. Were container orders up in the first quarter?", "Jay Malave", "Container orders were up over 40% in the first quarter.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, so you remember last year in the first quarter, we came in with this big backlog of containers and so sales at CCS were very strong in the first quarter, but the order rates started to decline and then we didn\u2019t really see any orders in container until mostly in about September and then it started to pick up and the trend that we saw in the fourth quarter is just accelerated here in the first quarter. So and containers are short cycle business but the leasing companies are buying and that looks like they\u2019re going to have a pretty good year, I think Jay already talked about 15% for that market for the year.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "And just one last one and then I will pass. That if you can speak to resi HVAC price costs and what\u2019s going on there? Are you feeling cost of lease given what\u2019s going on with raw math so you are getting kind of an associated drag down on selling prices as the raw math come down?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "No, in fact, I think we feel pretty good about cost price. There was a price increase as obviously drift back in effective January 1 so far so good there. Some of the commodity benefits that we see again, its short cycle, it\u2019s been up and it\u2019s down, it\u2019s been as high as about 390 last year, we are pretty well locked in on copper for the year, little bit of above what the current price is. But again, copper is a commodity that continues to come down, an importance of CCS as we move to, especially on the commercial side, some more of the aluminium plate and heat exchangers. So again, I think generally, we feel pretty good. It\u2019s never an easy pricing environment, but I would tell you that CCS is making some good strides to get a great distribution here in the U.S. and good product innovation and that\u2019s helping a lot.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research", "", "Perfect, thanks a lot.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thanks so much. So your release refers to defense impact at Sikorsky in the first quarter. Could you kind of explain that and maybe give us some color on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of sequester impact on the total business?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "Let me have Jay take you through Sikorsky and I\u2019ll take a shot at the sequester question.", "Jay Malave", "", "Cai, Sikorsky, we had lower deliveries on military aircraft. The after market was down \u2013 the military after market was down little bit over 20%. So that\u2019s really where you saw the big impact. The deliveries we knew about, but those were partially offset by some strong growth in commercial aircraft deliveries, and I think this quarter, we have 40 deliveries. We are expecting north of 240 deliveries for the full year. So you would expect that volume to increase on as we go throughout the year. So, partly, it was just timing of deliveries, partly it was particularly in the after market, was due to cuts.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "As far as the sequester impact, I\u2019d love to tell you that we can quantify at any better than what we did 30 days ago, but unfortunately the customers aren\u2019t sending us invoices with a 10% reduction for sequester \u2013 sequestration. So, we\u2019re hearing about it, we are starting to see a little bit of it in terms of the order intake. I think, Jay talked about the aftermarket was down 10% across aerospace, commercial aerospace in the quarter. And that\u2019s really just a reflection, again reduced off tempo in Afghanistan, but also reduced flying hours here. We see some of the fighter wings being stood down for the remainder of the year, cancelling some of the exhibitions. And again, all of this is going to have an impact on us. It\u2019s just going to take a while for us to play out. So we continue to say it\u2019s probably about a $0.10 impact, but again, it\u2019s hard to see it beyond that. I think the bigger concern is on these furloughs of the FAA, if they start driving the higher cost on the commercial airlines, but that could do the spares, but again I think that should be a relatively small impact for us.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "You mentioned the military aftermarket down 10% and seeing some cutback in the flying hours. I think in December, you were still kind of asserting at least in March still asserting military aftermarket would be half at Pratt. It looks like it was down. So where do you now expect military aftermarket to be for the year at Pratt?", "Jay Malave", "At Pratt, we were expecting it to be flat to slightly up, not much growth there. In the quarter, we actually saw growth in military aftermarket at Pratt really on the back of F100, F119 and F135 spares, and that was the F100 and F119 was really more of a reflection of the strong order of sales in 2012, just built a backlog we delivered here in the first quarter. And the F135 was more a pop-up function of disprovisioning and we have over 80 engines that\u2019s been delivered program to date, and so it\u2019s just a matter of provisioning start to accelerate.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "And so do you expect the military aftermarket still to be flat to up for the year, Pratt?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "At Pratt, we do. I think we\u2019re talking about that 10% what you really saw was at Sikorsky and at the Aerospace System, we had military aftermarket down about 20%. So good news at Pratt in the quarter but offsets by bad news at Sikorsky and at UTAS. I think again the Sikorsky numbers are little bit worse than what we had expected. On the OEM side, we know exactly what we\u2019re going to be from a military delivery side but spares we\u2019ve got a little worse than what we expected in Sikorsky. So need to keep an eye on that as move through the year.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. And you mentioned you still have the placeholder for CMH deliveries. Could you give us an update on your progress are out there Canadians? And you know I mean if you don\u2019t have, you can\u2019t say when you\u2019re going to have a settlement, I mean I assume that the age is going to be a zero until you have an settlement for us?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, like we\u2019re expecting that we\u2019re going to shift those need in the back half of the year. But I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re not making progress. We continue to have discussions, good discussions with the customer in Canada. Again, this is a very complicated procurement program in Canada with different public works and the department of the defense. We\u2019re working with both sides of the Canadian Government. We\u2019re trying to get through a win-win solution here. And it\u2019s just taking a longer than anybody wants in to and obviously we\u2019re ready to begin pilot training. There is four aircrafts up in Shearwater. I think number 26 of the 28 is on the production line down in the West Palm Beach. So we\u2019re building them and we\u2019re still not done with some of the mission software but we are making very good progress with that. So again we\u2019ll get pass this. I can\u2019t tell you whether its next week or next month or the month after, but I still think we have a pathway to deliver additional helicopters and the key for us is to get the pilots training to begin and we\u2019re pretty close to that.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Your line is now open.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Good morning", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hi, Dave", "Jay Malave", "Good morning, Dave", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Greg, just following up on Cai\u2019s question the CMH. The charge that you guys took in the fourth quarter does that reflect delivering the interim configuration aircraft or does it reflect you know not delivering the interim configuration aircraft and waiting till final configuration?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "All right, so the charge that we took $157 million I think it was in the fourth quarter that assume that we weren\u2019t going deliver any aircraft until 2015, with all the machine system software would be done. So, it didn\u2019t anticipate a interim solution even though we think ultimately that\u2019s the best for both ourselves as well as for the customer to head start delivering these interim aircraft get them flying, but the charge was a more conservative view of the fact that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver anything until 2015.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Okay. So, if we get to some sort of agreement that reflects the move towards taking the (inaudible) again the interim configuration aircraft potentially it could some good news.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, but I wouldn\u2019t, yeah, there might be a little bit of good news, you are right, again, this is, but again I wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a big number.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And then China, I know you talked about the strength in China overall in Q1, but can you talk about maybe what you saw as we went through the quarter, it looks like you know, January and February start up very strong but then, else we\u2019ve done in the March and April things might have gone up a little bit. And I think your guidance for China overall reflects about 7.5% to 8% GDP growth this year, you still feel that\u2019s the right place to be?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, we do. In fact, you see it was a weird compare because the Chinese New Year was in January last year, February this year, so January start about game busters, then February was slow and then March was even better than I think would anybody had expected, again, we\u2019re, you know, the units were up significantly, good order intake and even in April, I think we continue to see a solid order intake, we just did the operating review last week with Otis they were very confident in the China story for the year.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to go back to the aero systems margins for a second, the implied guidance I think it\u2019s around 15.6% or even slightly below. So, I\u2019m curious is there, usually that, historically both Goodrich legacy and Hamilton legacy got better the year progress on the margin side and I guess that 90 million purchase accounting that\u2019s something that hit you in the first quarter or to your early point Gregg, how much conservatives in this way to the aerospace systems?", "Jay Malave", "Myles, the 90 million is simply, charge that was taking in the fourth quarter related to the inventory step-up it just, it doesn\u2019t repeat because it got the inventories that have got fully liquidated in the fourth quarter. So, what we are dealing here, now we just, it is recurring earnings, which is consistent with our guidance of $2.1 billion. We based some of what we forecast, we expect it to be fairly flat level loaded as far as operating margins throughout the year, but as Gregg said, it\u2019s possibly could be some upside it\u2019s a little early to make that call.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, as you think\u2026", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We had about just under $50 million of net synergy benefit in the first quarter, when talking about $200 million for the year obviously those synergy benefits continue to pick up that\u2019s going to accretive to margins and again I think there\u2019s probably a little bit of good news, but it\u2019s just, it\u2019s April so we are going to wait another quarter here before we decided that it\u2019s actually that what the upside might be", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, I mean, it just seems like the aftermarket we get better historically those margins expand through the course of the year so I\u2019m just trying get out\u2026", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "Yeah.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Anything in the first quarter but it sounds like there wasn\u2019t?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "No I don\u2019t disagree with your [thesis] still Myles.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay and the other question kind of clean up, it\u2019s on discontinued operations cash, it looks like there was a big use in the quarter and I guess I don\u2019t know what the cause of that was?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Unfortunately the Federal government requires us to pay taxes when we make the gain, so the gain on the sale of the industrials which closed in December 15 as we paid the taxes here on the first quarter, so that was the big cash outflow.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That makes sense. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Yes. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Greg, Hamilton Sundstrand had no organic growth in the quarter, is that a combination of OE growth, after market growth offset by military being down?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, I think the commercial after market was essentially flat at the legacy Hamilton business. Military, as I said, was down significantly. And then commercial OE was up, I think 8% to 9% in the quarter.", "Jay Malave", "Yeah", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Okay. And then at Otis, the margin this quarter was a little bit less than I thought. Is that still a mix issue and where OE was a little bit worse than service and is that change going forward or we still seeing a lot of pressure from the after market renegotiations?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think, yeah. We have \u2013 margins were down. This actually should be the low-point for the year in terms of Otis margins, but a big chunk of this was as we \u2013 we picked up about a point of mix in the new equipment versus service. So that\u2019s actually detrimental, as you know service margins are obviously better than the OE side. So that was a piece of it. Again, pricing tough around the world, tough in China, but we\u2019re holding the margins, I think and we should continue to see benefits. The other thing to keep in mind at Otis or the process is some of this plant transformation. We\u2019re closing our Nogales plant and opening up the facility in Florence, South Carolina. We\u2019ve got the new Chongqing plant and there are some expenses in the first half of the year, which were actually holding margins down a little bit. It should get better as we complete those transfers.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Okay. Thanks, very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, gents.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "Nigel.", "", "Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "So, I hate to ask you this question but where is the contingency now at the midpoint, given the sequester et cetera?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "Well, it\u2019s actually \u2013 if you remember back in March, we said that we were comfortable with analyst\u2019s consensus, which at the time was 610 with about a $0.10 impact from sequestration. So, again, there was no contingency at 610. Again, if you go back down to the midpoint to $6, obviously we\u2019ve got a little bit of good news. And again, as a closeout to quarter \u2013 again no surprises here, so, really there is some puts and takes, may be (inaudible) a little better, try it a little worse in terms of spares. But, I think overall, feel pretty good. We got benefit from the euro. Again, we\u2019re seeing that a 128 it\u2019s been 132, 133. So, right now, I would just tell you in around 610, there is no contingency, but that includes an impact from sequestration. And we will expect, we\u2019ll see over the course of the year.", "Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So, no change, that\u2019s great. And then switching to Otis, obviously, you have great backlog performance this quarter, but how does margin look on that backlog?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Actually, margin doesn\u2019t look bad. I mean here, again, pricing is tough in China, so the margins there are going to be a little bit under pressure. But, again, as we fill up the factories with all of these orders going through that\u2019s going to help overall margins there. So, even though new equipment, the sold margins are a little late, I think we can pick that up. And then in North America, we\u2019re actually seeing much stronger, better, stronger margins in the new equipment. Pricing has stabilized. We\u2019re not seeing, again, all of the, say, cuts or competition that we had. And again, the market is picking up. So that\u2019s good news on new equipment margins.", "Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yeah. Otis continues to take out cost, they\u2019ve done a great job of taking out cost of the elevator unit cost, sorry, page will show that in the March meeting and that\u2019s going to continue. So feel confident that margins will remain and we\u2019ll leverage the volume going forward.", "Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay. And then just going back to Jeff\u2019s question on the CCS, copper prices, obviously down, that\u2019s similar pricing holds on the equipments, why won\u2019t steel or copper price benefit the second half of the year, as you go through this own hedges?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "Mostly because we\u2019ve got the year locked in at a price of little bit above what the current market is so the market is I think around 320 today, because of concerns over China, we could see that $320 moved to $360 or $370 I think pretty quickly, but we are locked in for the year so the CCS guidance as soon as locked in copper, no real benefits from further commodity cost reductions, again that benefit, again we\u2019ll see it, next year, as we will start to lock in buys for next year in today\u2019s lower prices.", "Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "I see. And then just one quick one, obviously container was down this quarter, but orders suggest that\u2019s going to come back strongly in 2Q and beyond, how much mix headwind did you have from container this quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "Well, in terms of\u2026", "Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "On CCS margins?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "", "I don\u2019t know whether I got that number off to the top of my head.", "Jay Malave", "", "Yeah, we don\u2019t I mean again one thing I would say about CCS is there, operating margins across the board are fairly even so we got much more balanced, and I am not sure, that it had a huge impact, we will take a double to look at it again and I think we will get back to you on that.", "Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay, that would be great. Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks a lot. Yeah, so I guess my first question is within CCS. You\u2019ve had a bunch of companies Ingersoll, Schneider and so on complaining about how weak foreign security is as an end market right now. Could you just remind us how much of CCS post all these divestments is foreign security and what your sort of expectations off for the year in that business?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Just one second, Julian and I will give it that for you. So I think, see here, as I would think about Fire & Security, again, the products piece of the Fire & Security business has actually done quite well. You see pretty good strength here in North America. It\u2019s been a little bit weaker in Europe. We\u2019re really seeing kind of the headwind has been on the service side in Europe and that\u2019s been really a result of just what\u2019s going on economically here in some of the services businesses, but margins have not been very good. We\u2019re trying to be a little bit more selective there. But in China for instance, I think securities are up very strong. We had a good traction with the GSP business. Correct, I don\u2019t know Jay do you have the exact...", "Jay Malave", "Just rough order of magnitude here Julian out of the $17 billion portfolio about $6 billion is Fire & Security.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got it. And you\u2019re expecting that to be kind of flattish or up inline with CCS overall for the year?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah I think on the product side, you\u2019d expected to be up inline and then on the service side a little bit light to that overall kind of 5% growth.", "Jay Malave", "It varies regionally, in Europe the expectation again were flattish and maybe up slightly.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Sure, thanks. And then just my follow up would be, again just circling back to the Otis margins. As you said Q1 you had, you didn\u2019t have sort of the operational leverage showing up because of the mix of OE versus services. I guess it\u2019s likely that European service stays weak and the Otis suggests the OE growth in terms of revenue should accelerate. So you\u2019re probably dealing with that mix hit for the balance of the year. Do you therefore expecting an offset to come from a lot more restructuring savings coming through already, just the falling out of those costs around the plants transformation?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It\u2019s obviously a combination of both. Otis is pretty aggressive with restructuring last year. They\u2019ve got more restructuring to do this year. We should be accretive to margins and then you got the factory transformation, which get done really by mid-year. So, that\u2019s all going to be help I think on the margin mix side.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jay Malave, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone an opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself in the queue and we will answer as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory Hayes", "Okay, thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, UTC reported second quarter earnings per share of $1.70, that's up 5% versus 2012 with better than expected segment operating profit growth and higher net gains. Second half profit grew by 15% led by strong performance at Climate Controls and Security, and also with the benefit of the Goodrich and IAE acquisitions.", "Gains in the quarter receded restructuring by $0.05 as compared to $0.04 last year and taxes were a $0.13 headwind to earnings growth. You recall that last year we had about 23% effective tax rate in the second quarter as compared to about 28% this quarter. So the solid first half of the year, given an uneven economic environment.", "We have accelerated restructuring, positioned the business now for further growth. Additional restructuring savings, combined with good orders momentum and easier compares in the back half, give us confidence to increase the bottom end of the EPS guidance range, so you saw the press release. We now expect earnings per share of $6 to $6.15. That's growth of 12% to 15%, an increase with our prior guidance of $5.85 to $6.15.", "We continue to expect double-digit earnings growth despite these uneven end markets. In the U.S., the potential fed tightening caused some volatility in the markets, but we still believe the economy is recovering and we are seeing strengthen in the leading sectors. Auto sales were up 8% in the first half and are growing at the fastest rate in five years. Housing starts are 24% higher year-to-date. And, in commercial construction, the Architectural Billing Index has shown expansion in eight of the last nine months, so good progress in the US.", "Europe, of course, a little different store with unemployment now over 12% in the PMI or Purchasing Managers Index consistently below 50, and we didn't plan for much growth in 2013, but the fact of the matter is, we are actually still seeing a slight contraction in sales in Europe. Year-to-date sales are down about 3% across our commercial businesses.", "On the other hand, we do see continued strength in China, and we are all cautiously watching the economic indicators coming out of China. We talked about some falling imports, exports, tightening of credit markets, lower GDP forecasts, so whether it's 7% or 7.5%, GDP growth, is still one of the fastest-growing markets. Because fixed investments has continued to grow and that's driving very strong order growth at both Otis and CCS.", "Aerospace, we continue to see strong growth in the commercial aviation industry. RPM's up 5.6% in the month of May, airlines are now projected to earn over $12.7 billion for the year. While we continue to see pressure in the military, and particularly at Sikorsky, the overall aerospace industry remains very healthy.", "Okay. Let's talk about orders for a second. We are on slide two for those of you following along on the webcast. I talked about economic uncertainty remains, but as you can see on slide two, overall our orders positioned us well for growth in the second half of the year. Just as a reminder, we talk orders at constant currency as we normally do.", "Otis as we mentioned very strong quarter, 22% growth in new equipment orders. That was led by China with 35% growth. That's 32% growth in China year-to-date for Otis, so very strong recovery.", "Climate Controls and Security global equipment orders grew for the third straight quarter. This reflects the strength in the U.S. economy where residential HVAC orders were up 19%, but partially offset by Europe, which was down about 4% across the CCS businesses.", "Turning to Aerospace, a very encouraging sign of Pratt & Whitney, after five quarters of contraction, legacy Pratt & Whitney large commercial spare orders grew 15%, organically. And importantly, this included growth across all three major engine families PW2000, PW4000 and the V2500.", "Aerospace Systems, we saw growth for the second straight quarter with orders up 4% on a pro forma basis. We're still looking for more recovery in the back half, but it's good to see growth of both Pratt and UTAS on the commercial spares side.", "So, in summary, despite the uneven end markets strength in the U.S. emerging markets in commercial aerospace are going to offset the softness that we are seeing in Europe and defense. Our orders momentum still points towards recovery in the back half, but as I said in June, with year-to-date. organic sales down slightly we are now probably going to see organic revenue growth of about 3% for the full year, which is at the low end of our prior range, so total sales are now expected to be just around $64 billion for the year.", "Turning back to Q2 results and on slide three, total sales and segment profit increased 16% and 15%, respectively. That's driven of course by Goodrich and IAE acquisitions and the strong operating performance of CCS.", "Organically, sales were flat versus prior year following a 2% decline in the first quarter. CCS had another strong quarter, 7% operating profit growth and margin expanded to 120 basis points as they continue to realize savings from the integration of carrier in FNS and capitalize on their operating leverage.", "Overall, segment operating margins at UTC declined 20 basis points with the strength at CCS more offset by headwind from pension and the decline in the military business at Sikorsky.", "Goodrich and IAE acquisitions continue to exceed our expectations and contributed $0.20 of earnings in the quarter. As I mentioned, earnings per share of $1.70 include $0.05 gains in excess of restructuring. $0.19 of the gains in the quarter came from the sale of the Pratt & Whitney Power Systems business and some small tax settlements. These are more than offset by $190 million we invested in restructuring, including $93 million at Pratt & Whitney as we continue to reduce the cost base there.", "Foreign currency, small impact of about $0.01 in the quarter. Free cash flow, 101% of net income. We repurchased an additional $335 million of stock and we expect to buyback a similar amount here early in the third quarter.", "So I will stop here for a second and let Jay take you through the segment results, looking back and talk about full year. Jay?", "Jay Malave", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page four. Otis sales improved 4% at constant currency in the quarter led by solid high-single digit growth in new equipment and continued growth in service sales. New equipment sales were up in all regions led by double-digit growth in China and Russia. Operating profit was up 1% at constant currency. Solid growth in China and other emerging markets was offset by continued weakness in developed Europe and transition costs associated with the factory transformation in North America.", "New equipment order growth was strong, up 22% at constant currency with double digit growth in Americas and Asia led by a 35% improvement in China. Orders in Europe were down mid-single digit. Given continued pressure in Europe and a significantly weaker Yen, we now expect full year profit growth at Otis of $75 million to $100 million versus the prior range of $100 million to $150 million. We expect profit improvement to come in the second half based on conversion of a higher new equipment backlog, especially in China, continued savings from restructuring and completion of the factory transformations in North America.", "On slide five. Climate Controls and Security increased profits to 7% in the quarter on 1% lower sales, resulting in another sharp increase in margins, up 120 basis points from prior year to 16.9%. Organic sales were up 1% with mixed results across geographies. Europe was down mid-single digit amid continued economic weakness in the region, while Americas was up low single-digit, driven by 13% growth in the residential HVAC business. China was also up mid-single digit, while Asia overall was flattish, driven by a decline in Australia. Transicold was up 11%. While the organic growth in the quarter was modest, this was the first quarter of growth in over a year and we anticipate acceleration through the remainder of the year.", "On profit, CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth driven by strong conversion on the higher organic sales, restructuring and productivity, including continued savings from the consolidation of carrier and fire and security and lower commodity cost. Global commercial HVAC orders were flattish with 10% growth in Asia offsetting declines in North America and Europe.", "Orders for global fire and security products were up mid-single digit while the fuel businesses were down a similar amount. Transicold orders were up 5% and commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were down 5%. With solid results in the first half and anticipated organic improvement, we now expect profit growth to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million, up from $150 million to $200 million on low-single digit organic sales growth at CCS.", "Turning to aerospace on slide six. At Pratt & Whitney, sales and profit increased 5% in the second quarter. Higher sales were driven by the consolidation of IAE and transfer of the AeroPower business. Organically, sales were down 6% year-over-year due to lower military engine shipments, partially offset by higher large commercial engine OEM sales. Large commercial spare sales were up 2% organically over last year's second quarter. On a pro forma basis, including consolidated IAE sales in both quarters, large commercial spare sales were up 5%. Profit growth was driven by the benefits from the IAE consolidation, restructuring savings, and lower E&D, partially offset by lower organic sales and higher pension costs. In addition, the absence of favorable one-time items in last year's second quarter offset the benefit of a commercial contract closeout this quarter", "As Greg mentioned, Pratt & Whitney, large commercial spares orders were up 15% organically. Based on year-to-date sales however, we now expect large commercial spares to be flattish for the year organically from up mid-single digits.", "Pratt & Whitney's proactive cost reduction and restructuring measures give us confidence in its full year profit growth outlook of $100 million to $150 million and mid-single digit sales growth.", "UTC Aerospace Systems delivered another solid quarter with operating profit of $532 million and sales of $3.3 billion. On a pro forma year-over-year basis, sales were up mid-single digit with commercial OEM, up double digits and commercial aftermarket, up mid-single digit, partially offset by declines in military OEM and military aftermarket of mid-single digit and low-single digit, respectively.", "Orders for commercial spares grew 4% on a pro forma year-over-year basis. Compared with the first quarter, profit was up 4% on 2% higher sales, driven by solid conversion on sales growth and continued synergies capture.", "With the first half of the year complete, we now expect full year sales to be around $13.5 billion, the low end of our previous guidance range of $13.5 billion to $14 billion. We continue to expect operating profit of around $2.1 billion in spite of lower sales due to continued cost containment and better than expected synergy traction.", "Turning to Sikorsky on slide eight, operating profit decreased 24% and 3% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 62 aircraft, including 47 based on military platforms and 15 commercial. Sales decrease was driven by lower military aftermarket volumes as well as unfavorable military aircraft mix, partially offset by higher commercial volumes.", "The profit decline was driven by lower sales as well as headwinds from the multi-year 8 margin reset and higher pension and export compliance costs. For the full year, we continue to expect profit to be down $100 million $150 million and low single digit sales growth. We expect profit improvement in the second half and benefits of higher aircraft volumes and restructuring savings.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg to wrap up.", "Gregory Hayes", "Okay. Thanks, Jay. So, I am happy to report that with the completion of the Rocketdyne divestiture in June, we are now done with the major portfolio transformation. Entire organization took on a huge task over the last two years, complete two significant acquisitions, integrate new organizations, divest over $4 billion worth of businesses and paid down $7 billion of debt.", "I'll tell you that team executed flawlessly. We now have a portfolio that's well-positioned for long-term growth and we've capitalized on the big the urbanization and commercial [aerospace].", "Some other highlights in the quarter, we announced significant wins across our aerospace businesses at the Paris Air Show. Pratt & Whitney announced orders for over 1,000 engines and claim orders for the launch of the second-generation Embraer regional jet. Customers see the advantage of our engine and have placed firm and option orders now for over 4,500 engines.", "UTAS Aerospace Systems business is also well positioned with the electric system, cell, wheels and brakes and other systems at Embraer. They also secured new long-term MRO contracts from several airlines and supported Airbus in the certification A400M.", "Sikorsky continues to see strong international demand announcing orders for 11 S-76D search and rescue helicopters for Japan, and 6 additional S-92 for the Chinese oil and gas market.", "On the commercial side, our business has continued to win key orders. Otis was awarded the largest elevator contract ever in India. We sold 670 elevators and escalators for the Hyderabad Metro. Otis also won a contract to install 255-unit at Tianjin 117, which is nearly 600 meters, will be one of the tallest buildings in China.", "CCS was rewarded the contract in the quarter with China resources land to provide HVAC, fire detection system in residential and commercial buildings across China over the next two years. So, the investment in innovative products is paying off. We are delivering real value to our customers and securing keywords that will drive top line growth well into the future.", "Okay. Let's take a look at rest of 2013. As I mentioned, we now see earnings of $6 to $6.15. That's the top end of our prior range and represents earnings growth of 12% to 15%. Our relentless focus on cost reduction will allow us to delivery double-digit earnings growth. We continue to invest in restructuring as well. We spent about $240 million in the first half of the year and the businesses have good payback projects in the pipeline.", "With almost $435 million of one time gains realized to-date on a pretax basis, we now expect about $450 million of both gains and restructuring for the full year. That\u2019s up from our prior estimate of $350 million each. So you can expect about $100 million of restructuring in each of the next two quarters.", "Strong cash flow, of course, remains the hallmark of UTC and we continue to expect free cash flow to equal or exceed net income for the year. We paid down $1.2 billion of debt in the second quarter. That\u2019s almost $1.6 billion in the first half and we have an additional $1 billion due in the fourth quarter. So we will pay down about $2.5 billion of debt this year.", "We are also buying back shares. The remaining $335 million in our original share repurchase plan will be completed here early in the third quarter and we expect to do a little bit more towards the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter assuming cash flow remains strong.", "So portfolio transformations behind us, we are focused on integration and execution and we are seeing a gradual recovery in our end markets. The order book supports a resumption of organic growth in the back half and we are confident in the revised EPS guidance.", "So with that, Bob, let's open up the call for questions, if we can.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Hello, Carter.", "Operator", "Mr. Copeland, if you wouldn\u2019t mind checking your mute button. Moving on to our next question in queue from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Just a couple of questions. Greg, first just on share repurchase. So you are going to blow through your placeholder really quick but it still sounds like you are kind of soft cuddling in the back of the year? Can you just give us some thought on how cash looks in the back half? Your effort to maybe repatriate some foreign cash that you talked about and why there wouldn\u2019t be room for that that repu to come up a little bit more?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes. So this year was the soft peddling in the share buyback. We are going to take it up. I think the question is how much. I said we are having $200 million, $300 million, $400 million, and it will really depend upon strong cash flows in the back half of the year. As you know, CapEx is at a ramp. We spent a little over $600 million year-to-date, and we have got plans for about $1.7 billion. So there is still a call on cash in the back half of the year which is a little higher than what we expect.", "We will also, as I said, are paying down about $2.5 billion of debt and you recall going into the year, we talked about only about $1 billion of debt due. So I think we have been aggressive on the debt paydown. We have got CapEx in front of us but we still have room to take share buyback up and we have still got that $1 billion placeholder out there for M&A.", "Not a lot going on, but there is always the possibility something could still happen for the year. So I think we are in line to do more share buyback and clearly if the M&A doesn\u2019t happen, it gives us a little bit more room but I am just going to tell you, there is other calls on cash right now.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Right, got it. Understood. Also, could you just give us your quick take on what your pension tailwind looks like for next year? If you were to snap a line today at these interest rates?", "Gregory Hayes", "So obviously there is going to be tailwinds next year in the pension. There is a lot of things going on there. First of all, you have got the fact that four years ago, we decided to sell the plant so we have taken the tough actions and that gives us tailwind. We also have losses for 2008 that come off. And you have got (inaudible) about 4.6% on a discount rate versus 3.% last year.", "You guys know how to do the math. That\u2019s about $28 million to $29 million (inaudible) basis points. So there is definite tailwind from pension next year. Again, it is a little early because there is other assumptions that go into the pension number for tailwind and all that but for the most part, there will be pretty good tailwind next year.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Then, finally, and I will move on, but just on China Otis, can you just give us a little more color on where you are seeing the strength? Is it broad or is it less than China? And, just what's going on kind of competitively with pricing in particular.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes. So, we talked about it. Orders on a constant currency basis were up 35%. I think HVAC were 39% orders growth and sales were up about 20%. We also saw pretty good traction on the service business with sales up 25%, so good strength there. Pricing remains tough, but the margins are holding up in China, because we continue to be able to take cost out of the supply chain and leverage on the higher volumes.", "As I think about specifically from a market perspective, where we are seeing the growth, residential was obviously the key. It is the biggest market for Otis elevators and it is very, very strong still despite some of the cooling measures, we've also seen the commercial office buildings start to improve. Social housing has kind of leveled off. I think, Otis would tell you today that the market is going a lot faster than what we had anticipated going into the year and I think these order rates more than support that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Good morning. Thank you. Nice numbers. A couple things, Greg, and kind of rattle through them. One on interest expense, I can never seem to get it right. You are refinancing, you are taking some charges for doing some things. Could you just give us a range of what you think you could look for interest expense for the full year?", "Gregory Hayes", "Howard, for the year we are in the range of about $950 million is what we would expect it should be for the year.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Okay. You took some fairly substantial actions at Pratt to lower cost. Could you talk about some of the benefits from the operating leverage that you expect in the second half of the year and going forward given the change in mix and other things?", "Jay Malave", "Yes. So, back half of the year Pratt's good. Obviously, the spares are not going to be as we had expected originally going in. And, we talked about kind of 5% growth or so in spares going into the year, probably more like flattish given how low the first half was, but again good orders momentum. We should clearly get some traction out of spares in the back half of the year.", "We took out I think about 575 people took advantage of the voluntary early retirement program that we just offered. That will help again in the back half of the year, add some earnings growth to Pratt. We are taking some other actions around the business as well to take advantage of some of the cost reduction opportunities out there.", "R&D is coming down as we had expected about at probably $75 million $500 million. I think it was down about $14 million in the second quarter, $35 million in the first, so we are half way there in terms of the R&D reduction, so a lot of good things going on at Pratt. Spares are coming back and this is a tough year at Pratt. We got this big trough, because military engines are coming down significantly. Although mill spares that had held up pretty well and you've got an increase in the commercial shipments which as you know come with a little bit of a bill.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "You changed management at Pratt commercial, kind of separated the organization into two. What are the marching orders for the two gentlemen going forward on that?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes. So, (Inaudible) call, because he led that business, he is President for the last seven years. He is the guy that has been at the forefront of the GTF marketing campaign. On that side he's done a hell of a job, but it's a huge job. And, I think what we have decided to do, what Dave Hess and Alain have done is to split that up between an aftermarket focus and an OEM focus, so Dave Brantner is going to take over. He is head of the OEM side of the Commercial Engine business, President there.", "Then Matthew Bromberg, who is Head of our strategy development group for the last couple of years, who is going to lead the aftermarket, and his focus is simply on making sure we have a flawless launch on the GTF and making sure that we capture the aftermarket channel going forward on all of these GTF orders that we won. So, again, I think it makes a lot of sense [Greg] is going to focus on getting engines delivered, getting cost down, winning new campaigns and Matthew is going to focus on that moving that aftermarket and continuing to drive growth in the aftermarket.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "I just have one last question. 787 has had some challenges in operation are very minor ones, but some of it comes back to working on and enhancing the reliability of the electrical system. What are you doing there and can you talk some of the improvements you've made already?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, Howard, as you know I think with any new airplane, there is always teething problems and we have had a couple of issues of the electric power system and we worked closely with Boeing during the production hiatus. I think we took the opportunity to go out there and to improve reliability of some of our power panels where we had a couple of issues. There is just constant teething problems, but again, because the 787 has got so much publicity, I think people are hearing a lot more about it but the fact is, this plane is as reliable and more reliable than the 777 was when it was introduced into service. Our systems are doing very, very well. So, well here, we have got a lot of systems, nine major systems on the aircraft. Each one might have a minor glitch but I think, overall, The Boeing Company would tell you that are working very closely with them to get all these things behind us.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue is from Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Your line is open.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities", "Hey, Greg, a couple of things in CC&S. Maybe can you just give us a sense of how you are thinking about the second half there. Transicold, you had revenues up 11%, but orders I think you said up 5%. That looks like make it slows a bit. Can you gauge the different components of the CC&S in the second half?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think we go through all of the CCS businesses. Obviously, Transicold is an important part but not the only part but we did see decent order growth in the second quarter and sales were up mostly because of the very easy compare last year. You recall, last year, on the container side, we didn\u2019t get any orders, I think, from May through September in that business.", "So the compares get very east in the back half of the year and we continue to see pretty good traction on the container side. Also on the truck trailer side, both North America and Europe are seeing good order growth. Europe, surprisingly, is strong, given where the economy is but that\u2019s all coming from cold chain expansion in the Eastern European area. So that business is doing well. The thing about res in the U.S., again, very strong orders growth, good revenue growth. We think that trend is going to continue and it will support a very strong back to the year.", "So if you think about it, first half of the year, we didn\u2019t get much growth out of CCS in total, but we did get growth in some key markets. Again, China was another place where we saw good growth at CCS. Orders, I think, on commercial HVAC were up about 15%, 16%. F&S products were up over 30%. So there is good momentum in the emerging markets despite the fact that Europe, overall, was down 1%, I guess, on commercial and a couple of points on the F&S business.", "So lots of moving pieces. We have taken the revenue guidance down for CCS. We now expect probably around 3% organic revenue growth for the full year which still indicates pretty solid growth in the back half of the year.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities", "Okay, great, thanks. Then just so taking up the restructuring. In terms of the payback, what kind of year-over-year savings do you now expect in '14 from the actions you are taking?", "Jay Malave", "One of these programs run average about two years, Shannon. So this year we are talking about incremental $100 million plus. So you are probably looking next year in that range of another $100 million of these actions.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities", "So that total, in terms of the total $450 million, how much year-over-year sales growth?", "Gregory Hayes", "So it gives us about $100 million of benefit this year because we have taken a lot of these actions in the first half year and a lot of them are on the quicker payback, like the voluntary early retirement program that we have done at Pratt. So the other headcount actions we have taken at CCS and UTAS. Some of the other things that we are still doing in the back half will be a little bit longer payback, probably 1.5 to two years. So its going to be $100 million this year and then $100 million to $125 million next year of savings. So it will be probably $250 million of runrate savings by the end of next year.", "Operator", "Our next question in the queue is from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Just following up actually on the restructuring. Greg, are you seeing the same payback opportunities now on some of these new projects that you were a year ago or two years ago when you look just across the company and you look going forward, do you think there is continued opportunity and the same kind of quality opportunities as we look into next year as you have seen in the past?", "Gregory Hayes", "Joe, we came into this year thinking we probably do $150 million to $200 million of restructuring. The fact is, restructuring is a way of life here at UTC. It's how we drive productivity. I will tell you, that we just continue to come up with good payback programs. There are some things out there that some of these structural factory, the actions that take a little bit longer.", "Obviously, some of the UTAS actions that we are taking as we consolidate Goodrich, it will take a little bit longer to payback, but on average even with all that said we are still looking at two years or less payback for all of these programs.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Okay. Could you provide an update on CMH? There were some, they were media flurry the last few days. Just with some implications that they are still not taking helicopters. I know that's not new, but just an update on the program. And, I guess underlying the question, what is your level of confidence that this does not turn into a much, much bigger deal down the road?", "Gregory Hayes", "I would tell you, I feel better about CMH today than we have probably in the last year. We are gaining momentum with the customer. I think, importantly, we are going to start pilot training in August, so another month. We've got four helicopters up in Shearwater, Canada. That's going to serve pilot training. We've got another five helicopters that are sitting up in Hartford, New York, ready to be delivered. Two more in flight test.", "The 8 that we talked about going into the year, I think we've got a solid plan to deliver those. Still some issues obviously to work through with our customer, but I think again, we are seeing positive momentum. I don't think we are going to see a big, big bad news item coming out of here. I think here you saw some things in the really impressed with the seeking 50 years into service and it's been a great helicopter, but again 50 years and they are starting to have some issues with that helicopter. We got the best military helicopter sitting right there ready to go, so I think it's all pretty positive right now. Rick has really done a great job with the whole team and starting to sing around.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Okay. Then just one more quick one. On UTAS spares, do you still expect high single-digit or 10% I thinks is your exact guidance. I know you dropped the sales guidance a little bit there or to the lower end of the range, but specifically on spares.", "Gregory Hayes", "So spares at UTAS, I think, were up about 4% on a pro forma basis in the quarter. They were up. For the full year, we had talked about 10%. That's probably going to be more like 7% or so by the time we get all done, just because we haven't seen the first half growth, but continue to see pretty solid growth.", "Now looking at parts versus provisioning, remember we sell both spare parts as well as end items. Spare parts in the quarter were up over 10%. Provisioning was down about 10%, so still provisioning is a little bit lumpy. I talked to the guys yesterday. They see that we have got line of sight on the provisioning number to hit the full year, so pretty confident we are going to get in the mid-7% maybe 8% range.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Ron Epstein of Bank of America / Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Just a couple. On the Pratt orders, can you describe in more detail where you've seen them coming from? Is it you are seeing from the freighter market or where has the order activity pick up come from?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think, obviously, freighters is an important part, but I think most of the orders could actually come on the commercial airline side. As Jay mentioned, I think we talked about in the script, PW2000 spares were up significantly. The 4000s were up over 15% and Vs were up almost 15%, so we're really seeing strength across the board.", "Inductions into the engine centers are down year-over-year and content hasn't really improved, but we know as these planes keep flying, the customers need parts and that can go only so long and the glue we've been talking, this one is a four quarters, five quarters or six quarters, eventually spares come back and I think that's what we saw this quarter and we expect that kind of momentum to continue into the back half of the year.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Is there any regional strength maybe you are seeing that starting to come out? North America, the Europe and Asia, if you could characterize that?", "Jay Malave", "Ron, Pratt legacy fleet is more concentrate in North America and Asia, so we saw that pretty much across the board there. The V2500 fleet is a little bit more broad-based excluding Europe. Again, there wasn't any one particular region. It really stood out one way or the other. It's pretty even.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Then Maybe one more, Greg, if you don't mind. A much bigger picture question. Now that the portfolio reshaping, I guess the settle down, what has to happen for you guys to feel comfortable again about maybe adding something else to the mix, right? Is there a bias towards aero? Is there a bias towards industrial? I mean, how should we think about, and I know this is a longer term question about where you want to go with the portfolio over the next several years?", "Gregory Hayes", "As we said, the portfolio, at least for the near term, is set. I think, we are 55% Aero, 45% commercial. Eventually, we would like to probably get back to kind of a 50/50 split. But, for right now, we like the hand we have got. Especially with what's going on, on the other commercial Aero side. So the focus right now is really at execution. The next deal, I would tell you, that again as you think about the 50/50 split, it will probably be on the commercial side. I know, Geraud has some ideas, [Major] has some ideas. Nothing really imminent though, and I think, again we have got a lot on our plate right now and we would like to handle that. Urbanization continues to drive and will drive strong organic growth for years to come on the commercial side and also help on the Aero side. So I wouldn\u2019t look for anything big coming out of UTX for a few years.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Just back on the restructuring. The incremental $100 million, can you talk about which segments those are in? Then, related what are the favorable items that are coming in to offset that, that weren\u2019t unexpected earlier?", "Gregory Hayes", "So most of the favorable items, we have actually already seen them. We had a gain this quarter from Pratt power to sales Pratt power systems. We also had a couple of small tax settlements out there with the IRS that gave us a little bit. There maybe one or two more small divestitures on the CCS side that might generate a little bit more gain. So the gains are pretty much done.", "As far as the actual spend in the back half of the year, I think you will see that across the business here, UTAS, again we have talked about this, they have got about $100 million spend planned for the year. They have got some work to do to get to that $100 million, but they have got a lot of projects lined up. Pratt continues to look for things on the aftermarket side to do in terms of consolidation. More to come there.", "Obviously, Otis in Europe has some work to do with sales continuing to atrophy there on service side. Pedro and team, I know, are looking for ways to take some structural cost out of Europe. So I would expect more to come there. Really, again, everywhere we look we find opportunities to reduce cost. It's amazing what Geraud and the CCS team have done as they brought F&S and Carrier together. They are on a run rate to probably take $200 million of cost out of the business, which is credible. So always opportunities and it will be spread across all businesses.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Okay, and then you talked about for Otis, the profit being a little bit worse because of Europe and the weaker Yen. Are those about equal and is there anything that\u2019s a positive move that\u2019s offsetting?", "Jay Malave", "Well, Sam, if you look at the move from the midpoint to the midpoint and you are talking about $38 million, two thirds of that was the currency that was driven by the yen. Then the other third was essentially the net weakness from Europe, partially offset by higher restructuring and some rebuilding in China.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Okay, and then the last question is, you had talked, I guess, in the last month about the F100 court case. I guess, as we look out into the remainder of the year, is there an additional reserve that we should be looking for or any sort of a cash impact as we go forward?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, and no. For those of you that, what we are talking about here is the FEC or Fighter Engine Competition that started in 1983. I think just (inaudible), that that\u2019s not my fault. So the whole issue here is, we had the case. We had won it at the trial court. Government appealed it. It was remanded back to the trial judge.", "Right now, based upon outside legal counsel and our review, we believe that we will prevail on appeal. So we have not taken any reserve associated with this and we would not expect to have any cash impact on this for quite some time. The way these court cases work, I have my General Counsel sitting here, it will probably be a year and half or so before we ever get any resolution on this thing again. It has been going on for 30 years.", "So we continue to believe the government wasn\u2019t harmed and as you take a look at the 10-Q which we are going to file on Friday, we will have expanded disclosure in there. So you can go through all that and if you have any questions, give us a call but bottom line is, we think we are going to prevail on appeal.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.", "Peter Arment - Sterne Agee", "Just first question, I guess on Pratt & Whitney, I get the margin there really from the consolidation and some of the restructuring gains, but I was surprised just given the amount of commercial engine ramps, particularly in large commercial. Is that the level we should be expecting for the second half with a sequential uptick?", "Gregory Hayes", "On the OE?", "Peter Arment - Sterne Agee", "On the OE side. Yes.", "Gregory Hayes", "The OE should be growing a little bit in the second half. In the quarter, we had higher shipments, particularly in the wide-bodies with the GP7000 and A380. And, for the year, we are expecting GP7000 to still be up year-over-year, so we will see some growth there. Even now I don't know if it will be significantly higher than where it is today. I think, what we did in the quarter is generally speaking, probably where you would be.", "Peter Arment - Sterne Agee", "Okay. That's helpful. Then just a quick one on Sikorsky, I get that domestic DoD pressures. Can you just give us an update or color on some of the major international pursuits that are out there?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think, Sikorsky continues to make good progress on the international side. We are working with Turkey on a relatively large opportunity there with the Turkish Utility Helicopter program. We expect to get something finalized by the end of the year there.", "The India navy contract has been a little bit of a disappointment just because it keeps pushing out to the west, but we've had good traction in Brazil. We've had good traction in Columbia and the Middle East. So, again, there's lots of foreign military opportunities out there and Sikorsky continues doing more than its fair share.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Can you comment, give us some color on the impact at carrier of the blistering heat wave we've had in the U.S. and Europe in July?", "Gregory Hayes", "It's good to own a air conditioning company when it's hotter. We talked about this, Cai, the orders were up almost 20% in the quarter of res side.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Yes, but you basically didn't see the heat wave in June. You saw it in July, which is.", "Gregory Hayes", "So, sales were up 12%, 13% order were even more. The fact is, it takes some time to actually see that come through the channel. It's two-step distribution, so we sell into through our major distributors who then sell up to dealers, so we would expect to see some level of good news yet here in the July-August. I think, orders have continued to be pretty good.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "In Paris you were kind of talking about things being somewhat better, and it looks like things were definitely more than somewhat better, particularly on the 4000s. Was there sequential improvement as I read that you went through that quarter and kind of give us any color on what you are seeing in July?", "Gregory Hayes", "Sequentially, in the quarter, sales were up about 50% and orders were up over 30%, sequentially.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Talking about attached to PW4000.", "Gregory Hayes", "That was just in total. On 4000 itself I would have to get back to you on that, Cai.", "Jay Malave", "I think, Cai, that the fact as we started to see orders pick up April and May, I think it just accelerated into June. We had a very good month in June of bookings, but it's hard to point at any one thing in particularly other than just kind of pent-up demand that we've been talking about for the last year.", "So, again one month or one quarter is not a trend make, but we feel pretty good about the back half of the year. Frankly, we are seeing here the 23rd of July I think orders are okay here, but I don't think I want to be giving order data on a weekly basis here pretty lumpy.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Just in terms of color, did this sort of sequential improvement continue in July is best you can tell?", "Jay Malave", "Cai, I'll have to get back to you on that. I don't really recall. I focus more on second quarter and third quarter, but we'll take a look and see if there is anything significant there.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Terrific. The last question, you mentioned that military after market was weak at Sikorsky, maybe give us a broader view of kind of the impact you are seeing or expect to see from sequestration and basically military aftermarket across the company.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, so military sales or military aftermarket sales were down about 25% at the Sikorsky in the quarter and orders were down about 40%. It is hard to delineate between just the budget cuts and what's going on as the overseas continuity operations wind down versus sequestration.", "There has been some impact from sequestration just because it is taking us longer to get orders processed through the government to get contracts amended and things like that done. But it\u2019s a pretty tough environment on the aftermarket side but not surprising, the overseas continuity operations, the fund is down about half and Sikorsky, of course, is the big gun of this year of the Afghanistan campaign. So some of that is just natural and a little bit is also from sequestration.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue is from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Greg, just a couple of quick balance sheet questions. You have got around $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Do you think that\u2019s a good safe number to keep going forward? Or do you see an opportunity to bring that down going forward?", "Gregory Hayes", "The issue of the $5 billion, Rob, as you know, as most of that is sitting overseas. It's not all of that right now. We use that cash on a daily basis. We have got an inter company lending program where we lend out to the businesses for working capital needs. That\u2019s not $5 billion. You have also got a lot of cash, over $1 billion sitting in China that continues to grow as the businesses there continue to generate strong cash flows but hard to get at.", "So how much do you really need? Probably half of what's on the books. The other half it, it's just hard to get at and quite frankly from a tax perspective, very expensive to bring back to the U.S. We talked a lot about this. One of the benefits of the foreign cash is it does give the opportunity to make investments overseas and to do acquisitions overseas. So when you think about the M&A agenda, that\u2019s probably where to look next.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Okay, and then secondly on the balance sheet. You mentioned you have got about another $1 billion of debt you want to pay down this year. if you look at it over the longer term, what's your thinking on debt repayment on say, a five year period?", "Gregory Hayes", "We have got over a $1 billion that\u2019s due in December. It\u2019s the eighteen month floating rate note that we issued last May. That will actually get paid off. Then I would say, there is no debt payments due next year, although I would expect we will probably do another $1 billion of paydown next year and probably another $1 billion of paydown the following year.", "We are trying to get back into that solid A range with the rating agencies. So again, I think, I would model $1 billion, $1.5 billion of paydown each over the next few years and there is not much due after that. But again, I think, we will continue to deleverage and so we see an opportunity to do something more significant on the M&A side.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "I just had a question on Otis profits. I am looking at the guidance. It seems that you are assuming around flattish margins year-on-year in the second half. After that, it would be down about 70 bips in the first half. I just wondered, does the guidance embed any sequential or year-on-year improvement in your European aftermarket volume or price?", "Gregory Hayes", "No, in fact, I think Europe, in the first half has been a drag over probably over $40 million of headwind here in the quarter, or first half rather, from Otis's service business in Europe but we think they are starting to stabilize although there is still a little bit of pressure, particularly in Southern Europe. Year-to-date, Otis, essentially flat earnings.", "We have taken the guidance down to $75 million to $100 million. Piece of that was currency, a piece of that's Europe. But with this very strong orders momentum that we say here in North America as well as China, the back half of the year should be very good progress. There should get back on the path for earnings growth and should be able to hold margins as well.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks and then on the overall business, I think you mentioned 3% organic sales growth for the full year. You are running at about minus 1% in the first half. So does that mean we should expect mid-single digit organic sales growth already in Q3? So otherwise you will need double-digit growth in Q4?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes, it will pick up probably in that mid-single digits in Q3 and Q4 will be even a little better. Again, to think about these Otis orders that we are getting to date, it's about a six months turnaround time for the European groups or for the China orders. The other businesses little bit longer cycle than that. Spares, again, order rates are good.", "Talking about spares at Pratt were up 15% organically, sales only up 2%, so very strong book-to-bill, so sales will pick up again as we move into the third quarter. Then lastly, I'd just remind you that CMH will deliver in the fourth quarter. We got eight helicopters. That's about $400 million of revenue out of Sikorsky just in the last quarter.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Then just lastly a quick one, the CapEx is up about 50% the last six months. is that sort of a good run rate for the second half as well?", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes. In fact it's going to pick up even a little bit more. I think we spent over $600 million first half of the year. We got $1.7 billion plan, and that's really being driven by the a aerospace guys as they continue to a ramp up or facilitize for the ramp up in production that we are seeing on the commercial aero side and the new GTF platforms.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "I am interested in UTAS. You talked about provisioning being down a little bit, but I would think going forward with 787 growth you would see some real benefits from provisioning going forward pretty soon. So, I am interested in how you look at the 787 and UTAS right now both, in terms of provisioning but also in terms of any impact we might see with respect to margin on OE deliveries.", "Gregory Hayes", "Yes. So, provisioning, obviously was a little bit slower in the first half of the year than what we had expected because of the production delays echoing. But, again, as mentioned before, we see pretty good provisioning picking up in the back half of the year, especially with all these new customers, come online. I think Boeing, is going. I think right now we are at seven a month. They are on track to get to 10 a month. We are going to support that and that's actually going to drive some good provisioning orders.", "Keep in mind, about half of our customers are on care program where we actually do the provisioning ourselves and then charge a flight hour payment to the airline, so we're not getting quite a pick up that we had historically on some of the new program introductions, but from a return on investment standpoint it's a really good program. Benefits both, the airlines and UTAS, so good back half of the year.", "On the OE, side it's still a pretty tough story. We've got about $6.5 million of OE content and the margins are awful, and we got a lot of work to do on cost reductions yet on 787 that we talked about this. We are working with the Boeing Company, trying to identify cost reduction opportunities to take cost out for them and us some money, but it's a tough slog right now and there's a lot of work to do on cost reduction, particularly aero structure side of the business.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "I am also interested. When you look broadly at the whole business, you've done quite a bit of restructuring over the last couple of years. It looks like it's been very successful in terms of delivering better margins, getting cost down. But now when you look ahead, you've gotten some very encouraging orders in this last quarter. Do you see a point here, where you are transitioning really a different way to think about the company in terms of more growth potentially less restructuring, because you may not need to get your fixed cost base down much more? When could you get comfortable there?", "Gregory Hayes", "I think as soon as we've turned the corner on organic growth, but I think as we exit the year, but if we do as we expect, which should be kind of 5% or 6% run rate going out of the year. I think we'll need to do further structural cost reduction while it never goes away. I think, again, although focus will be on delivering on the organic growth and that just gives us huge operating leverage.", "I could imagine, CCS grew profits in the first half of the year and really no revenue growth, so cost takeout. That's really been the story in the first half of the year, but I got to tell you it's a lot more fun to see the top line growing and to focus on satisfying customer demands and restructuring, but restructuring never goes away. We're always looking for productivity and room to grow margins.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Are you comfortable that with restructuring efforts you have done and you have underway right now, you haven't done anything to your base that would constrain your growth, you are basically getting to the point where you are prepared for it? Is that correct?", "Gregory Hayes", "That's exactly right. I think on the aerospace side, specifically we moved some work to lower cost locations trying to consolidate work across the UTAS business. There's still more work to do for the Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand consolidation standpoint, but we feel very comfortable with where we are with the footprint.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Gregory Hayes", "All right. And thanks very much.", "Jay Malave", "Alright, well thanks to everyone. I appreciated that you are listening in on the call. We will, obviously, be around later in the day, so if you have any, to answer any of your specific questions but I really appreciate you all listening. So have a great summer.

(NYSE:UTX) Q3 2013 Results Earnings Call October 22, 2013  9:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Greg Hayes - Senior Vice President and CFO", "Jay Malave - Director, Investor Relations", "Geraud Darnis - President and CEO, UTC Climate, Controls & Security", "Analysts", "David Strauss - UBS", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Howard Guguel - Jefferies", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Deane Dray - Citi Research", "Operator", "Good morning. And welcome to the United Technologies\u2019 Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.", "The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permit.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, UTC recorded third quarter earnings per share of $1.55 that\u2019s up 13% versus 2012. We also saw a resumption of organic growth albeit modest and margin expanded to 16.6%.", "There\u2019re always a few bumps in the road such as the recent political impasse in Washington that has threatened economic recovery. But our strategy to deliver double-digit earnings growth remains in place.", "Following solid year-to-date performance, we are now confident in our earnings per share range of $6.10 to $6.15 that\u2019s growth of 14% to 15%, at the high-end of our previous expectation of $6 to $6.15, that\u2019s despite slower top line growth.", "The majority of our end markets are gradually improving but with defense down more than expected, and based on where we are year-to-date we now expect full year sales to be about $63 billion versus our prior estimate of $64 billion.", "There are still a couple of puts and takes to the year, and as I said earlier this month, some headwinds at Otis and Sikorsky, but upside at the other segments. Absent this significant external event, we see in fact the high-end of earnings per share range based on our proactive and aggressive restructuring and cost reduction actions, as well as improving end markets.", "As you see on slide two, organic sales grew 1% in the quarter with good growth across most of our end markets, tampered by relatively flat European markets and continued significant declines in defense.", "Our commercial businesses grew a combined 3%. We saw a continued recovery in North America with sales up 3% led by residential HVAC and Otis new equipment. Europe declined 1%, China was up 11% and continues to be the bright spot in Asia, but overall sales were up only 3%.", "Aerospace business continues to see good growth in commercial OEM and recovery in the commercial aftermarket. Revenue passenger miles were up 6.8% in August and were up 5% year-to-date. Oil prices have dampened profitability a bit, but the airlines are still forecasted to earn $11.7 billion this year and $16.4 billion in 2014. So a healthy industry and we see this in our business with our commercial aero sales up 7% in the third quarter. On the other hand, the military business remains a headwind with sales down 14%. We see this impact across our aero businesses, but most acutely at Sikorsky. Given the continued impasse in Washington, we don\u2019t expect this trend to improve over the next year. ", "Okay, take a look at orders on Slide 3. At Otis, new equipment orders were up 4%, a solid growth off a tough compare with the third quarter of last year which had a major contract awarded in the U.K. North America and China, both saw a double digit increases. Climate, Controls and Securities global equipment orders grew 13% as strengthen in Transicold and commercial spares orders were up 17% at Pratt & Whitney and 5% at UTC Aerospace Systems on a pro forma basis.", "All right, Slide 4; total sales increased 3% in the third quarter. Net acquisitions including Goodrich closed on July 26 last year contributed two points while the FX impact was negligible. Segment operating profit grew 14% and operating margins increased 160 basis points. That includes about 100 basis points from the absence of the inventory step up amortization at UTAS last year. As you heard from Geraud at our recent Investor Day in Monterrey, Mexico, CCS continues to drive synergies and leverage their global scale. Operating profit grew 10% leading to margin expansion of 170 basis points.", "Pratt & Whitney also expanded margins 290 basis points, on higher commercial aftermarket and aggressive cost reduction. And Sikorsky maintained double digit margins in the face of significant headwinds from sequestration and reduced defense spending. So the third quarter earnings per share grew 13% and we initiated $103 million in restructuring actions. Excluding restructuring and gains for both periods, earnings per share grew 19%. As previously noted, we expect to invest about $500 million of restructuring this year including over a $150 million in the fourth quarter.", "For the year, we continue to expect restructuring to be offset by onetime items. Free cash on the quarter was 82% of net income. This was unfavorably impacted by an increase in inventory over $500 million primarily at Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky as each ramps up their shipments in the fourth quarter. While we continue to see progress on the CMHP with the commencement of pilot training and we\u2019re maintaining our [place order] [ph] eight aircraft in the fourth quarter. In addition to the four aircrafts at the training facility in Shearwater, Canada, we have six aircraft, fully assembled and flight tested at the [Pittsford] [ph], New York storage facility.", "Seven are undergoing flight testing at our West Palm Beach facility. The balance of the 20 aircraft are in production. As the program continues to advance, we\u2019ll provide updates as more progress is made. ", "The quarter capital expenditures were $383 million, a little more than $1 billion year-to-date as we invest with the aero ramp up at both Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems. For the year, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion as we noted before. Also in the third quarter we brought back $330 million of stock and we expect to buy back about $200 million in the fourth quarter.", "We remain confident that cash flow will equal net income in 2013 and we increased our dividend to $0.59 per share in the quarter a 10.3% increase. I\u2019ll be back to talk about 2014 in just a second, but let me stop there and turn it over to Jay, as he takes you through the business unit results.", "Jay Malave", "Thanks Greg. Turning to Page 5, Otis sales improved 4% at constant currency in the quarter led by solid high single digit growth in new equipment and continued growth in service sales. New equipment sales were up in all regions led by double digit growth in China, Russia and the Americas. Operating profit was flat at constant currency, but operating margins remained solid at 22%. Continued growth in China was largely offset by transition costs associated with the factory transformation in North America. In developed Europe, the rate of profit decline is slowing, the sequential growth in northern and Central Europe offsetting the continued weakness in Southern Europe.", "New equipment order growth was up 4% at constant currency with mid-teens growth in Americas and Asia with continued double-digit expansion in China. Orders in Europe were down high single digits as the prior-year benefited from our major contract award in the U.K. Excluding this award as well as a significant order this quarter, Europe new equipment orders grew 12%.", "Given the headwind from the manufacturing and supply chain transition from the Nogales, Mexico to South Carolina and continued weakness in Southern Europe, Otis now expects full-year profits to be up around $25 million, from up $75 million to $100 million and mid-single digit sales growth.", "On Slide 6, Climate, Controls and Security increased profits 10% in the quarter on flattish sales, resulting in another sharp increase in margins, up 170 basis points from prior year to 17.1%. CCS is continuing to see slow but steady improvement in organic growth as Q1 was down 3%, Q2 was up 1% and now Q3 is up 2%.", "As you have seen all year, organic growth is mixed across geographies. Europe was down low single digit. China was up mid single digit while Asia overall was down about 1% driven by a decline in Australia. Americas was up low single digit driven by 9% growth in the residential HVAC business.", "Transicold was up 22% on a robust recovery in the container market after an exceptionally weak period last year. On profit, CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth, driven by strong conversion on organic sales, restructuring and productivity including continued savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire and Security, and lower commodity costs.", "Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up high single digit with growth in Asia and Europe more than offsetting flat orders in North America. Orders for global Fire and Security products were up mid single digit while the field businesses were down high single digit.", "Commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were up 2% while Transicold was up 17%, driven by Container and an easy compare over last year. With continued solid results through three quarters and steady sequential organic improvement, we expect profit growth to be around $200 million, the high end of the prior guidance range of $175 million to $200 million and 1% organic sales growth, all resulting in operating margin above 15%, two years ahead of target.", "Turning to aerospace on slide seven. Pratt & Whitney delivered solid results with 18% profit growth and 5% lower sales, resulting in margin expansion of 290 basis points. Organically, sales were flat as 22% growth in commercial spares was offset by lower military engine sales.", "Reported sales were down due to the power systems business divestiture. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by higher commercial spares volume and restructuring benefits, partially offset by pension headwinds and lower military volume.", "As you recall, last year we had the benefit of a supplier settlement that was largely offset by the benefit from licensing agreements this year. For the full year, we now expect Pratt & Whitney operating profit grow $150 million on low single digits sales growth.", "We expect profit growth to be at the high end of the prior profit range as large commercial aftermarket has stabilized and the benefits of proactive cost actions are realized.", "UTC Aerospace Systems delivered another solid quarter with operating profit of $525 million and sales of $3.3 billion. On a pro forma year-over-year basis, sales were up low single-digit with mid single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket, partially offset by low single-digit declines in both military OE and aftermarket.", "Year-on-year profit growth was driven by the absence of last year\u2019s inventory step-up cost, additional market of Goodrich and continued synergies realization. UTC Aerospace Systems expects to deliver around $250 million in synergies for the year and is well on track towards achieving the $500 million synergies target by 2016.", "Orders for commercial spares grew 5% on a pro forma year-over-year basis with improvement in both parts and provisioning. With approximately $1.6 billion of operating profit generated year-to-date, we\u2019re confident in the full-year operating profit outlook of $2.1 billion and sales of around $13.5 billion.", "Turning to Sikorsky, operating profit decreased by 21% on 7% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 61 aircrafts, including 42 based on military platforms and 19 commercial.", "The sales decline was driven by lower military OEM and aftermarket volumes, partially offset by strong growth in commercial shipments. The lower overall sales volumes, as well as headwinds from higher pension and compliance costs contributed to the operating profit decline.", "Sikorsky continues to see robust demand for its commercial product line with orders this quarter of over $400 million, a strong backlog in excess of $2.5 billion, including approximately $350 million from customers in China as of quarter-end.", "For the full year based on continued pressure in military aftermarket, we now expect profit to be down around $150 million, the low end of our prior guidance range and the low single-digit sales decline versus up low single digits previously.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. Thanks Jay. Before we take a look at 2014, there some other key items to note in the quarter. In late September we announced the creation of our new buildings and industrial systems organizations under the leadership of Urel Denise.", "While they will remain separate reporting segments, this will strategically to unite Otis and climate controls and security. This will create the leading commercial building organization in the industry and will allow us to accelerate growth by fully utilizing our unmatched capabilities and scale.", "Building on the success of combining our HVAC and fire and security platforms under CCS two years ago. This new organization creates opportunities to unlock further synergies and leverage each organizations field network to service customers in a wider geography. And with 30% of revenues in emerging markets we will focus our innovation on our next-generation buildings and integrating systems, where we see opportunities to create value for our customers.", "Also in the quarter Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems supported the maiden flight of Bombardier C Series aircraft on September 16th in Mirabel, Canada. A PurePower geared turbofan engine performed flawlessly on this historic flight of the first next generation narrow body aircraft. We are confident that the flight test program will further validate the performance characteristics, its noise, low emissions, significantly better fuel efficiency.", "While we always like to focus on the improved fuel burn of the GTF designs, just as importantly, the GTF noise footprint is up to 75% smaller than today\u2019s engine. And this creates opportunities to fly more direct routes into congested noise controlled airports.", "Smaller noise signature also allows to streamlining airport operations to expanded runway usage, as well as expanding current operational curfews at airports and heavily populated areas. This will give airlines the opportunity to work with airports to generate more revenue by opening additional take-off and landing slots, a good example of the value creation that our game changing technologies will bring to the table.", "Pratt & Whitney\u2019s performance, its best-in-class technology readiness and program execution is the reason why the GTF has captured orders for more than 4,700 engines. We also saw the first flight of Boeing 787-9 in the quarter as UTC Aerospace Systems continues to support Boeing in the development of this next generation family of aircraft. So a busy quarter and several significant milestones at UTC.", "Let\u2019s change gears for a second here and take a look at 2014. We had not surprises that compared to what we talked about just a couple of weeks back. Our strategy remains in place and we continue to target double-digit earnings growth in 2014.", "We expect solid growth in commercial aerospace and the commercial construction markets in North America and Asia to more than offset declines in our military aerospace business.", "As you all know, Europe remains a question mark. We will take a cautious approach and we are not planning for growth in Europe as we sit here today. The good news is that we finally seem some tailwind from pension next year.", "There were approximately $800 million of pension expense flowing through the P&L this year and it will be a welcome relief to see some benefits for lower acquisition charges and a higher discount rates.", "On the other side of the ledger we do have about $0.30 of headwinds from three significant items. It\u2019s obviously continued reduction in defense spending, both sequestration as well as the overseas contingency spending.", "There is also pressure on the tax rate primarily from the expiration of the tax extenders. And lastly, we will see some headwind from the initial GTF engine deliveries. It will improve as the technology matures but Pratt & Whitney will face some negative engine margin on deliveries of each platform over the next several years. These are great long-term progress that point towards bright future for Pratt & Whitney, but we will need to work down the learning curve as these aircraft enter service.", "So as always some pluses, some minuses and question marks as we look towards next year. We continue to leverage our industry-leading franchises and global scale. With the right strategy in place, we\u2019ll remain committed to delivering double-digit earnings growth once again next year.", "So with that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) First question is from David Strauss of UBS. Your line is open.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Hi, David.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Hi, Greg. In terms of looking at your revenue guidance and what implies for the fourth quarter it looks like in spite of about 4% organic revenue growth the comps were a little bit tougher relative to the third quarter. So can you talk about how you get there, what\u2019s different in the fourth quarter versus your third quarter?", "Greg Hayes", "I think, David, you are right. I think we will see organic revenue growth of about 3% to 4%, probably closer to 4%, as we sit here today. Again, you are going to see better deliveries at Sikorsky. I think Sikorsky takes up deliveries to about 80 aircraft in the fourth quarter. It delivered about 160 year-to-date, so you get a little bit a bump there, that\u2019s both commercial and the military, you see a little bit better performance at Pratt especially on the military aero side, I think we will ship about 20 JSF engines in the fourth quarter.", "And you are going to see on the commercial side an acceleration of organic growth, just because of the orders that we are seeing going into the year. We saw that here in Q3 in orders, I think organic was up 4%. Orders remain strong, so we will see again acceleration of growth at Otis and acceleration of growth at CCS into the fourth quarter.", "David Strauss - UBS", "And then on the order side, obviously the comps get a lot tougher as well in the [inaudible]. Would you expect order growth will still be positive in the fourth quarter at Otis?", "Greg Hayes", "Absolutely. I think, Pedro and team would tell you that their order trends remain, booking look very strong. We are still seeing good strength in North America. We are seeing good strength in China and even Europe is recovering. Again, I think as Jay noted before, if you take out that big U.K. Crossrail order for Q3 of last year I think orders actually grew about 12% there. So the economies are recovering and commercial construction seems to be at the leading edge of the recovery here.", "The one caveat I would say is Asia, outside of China has not been so great. India has been down, Japan, Korea, Australia. So that may be the dampener on the growth story in the fourth quarter, but we still expect solid orders growth. Same with CCS, again Transicold had a huge quarter. The orders were up 70% in the quarter at Transicold. But again that was off of a very easy compare. Compares will get more difficult but we had good momentum going into the fourth quarter.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Thanks. I will get back in queue.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Just a couple of quick ones. First, on the commercial, the spares piece, I wonder if you might provide a little bit more color around that growth rate and what you saw in the Vs versus PW4000s and some of the other engines?", "Jay Malave", "Sure. Carter, what we saw as growth in the PW4000s as well as the V2500 and that more than offset some declines in the PW2000 in both really sales and orders.", "Greg Hayes", "If you think about it, I think on a legacy basis, Carter, legacy Pratt spares are up about 10%, even the overall spares were up 17%. So really good strength in the V. Again it\u2019s a young fleet, we are starting to see [shaft] [ph] business pickup as we expected and a little bit of softness on the 2000. But again, legacy businesses is recovering.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Okay. Great. And on the military side, you talked about fewer engine shipments. Obviously the weakness at Sikorsky on the aftermarket side, but when you kind of look around against some of your peers, the size of the weakness at Sikorsky certainly stands out as anomalous, at least from what we can see so far today. So, are there any other elements of weaker military spending that aren't captured in those two and with respect what you're seeing at Sikorsky, what do you think is making that standout so much more versus what we\u2019re seeing you know elsewhere across defense space?", "Greg Hayes", "", "I guess there is a couple of pieces here to look at. I mean, military aero was down across all three of the aerospace businesses. We\u2019ve seen in Pratt again, we stopped the 119 deliveries last year, so we got some headwind from F119s, the F117, that goes on the C-17 that\u2019s going down and JSF is really ramping very, very slowly. So that\u2019s not a great story, although the aftermarket there is okay. At UTAS, we actually saw a reduction in military that surprised us a little bit and this is not sequestration so much as just some of the government agencies just curtailing and cutting back on some of their spending and our sensors business, which was most impacted.", "And then we go to Sikorsky. Sikorsky is a -- there is a couple of things there, obviously the aftermarket that we're seeing orders down 15% for the year, which was completely unexpected and we expected it to be down, but not by 15%. And then you've got again just the reduction of the quantities for the multi-year 8 versus multi-year 7 and the timing of some of the international military which is also getting pushed out of this year and into next. So it's been almost a perfect storm at Sikorsky this quarter. And as a result, they are going to be down at the high-end of their earnings range, down about a $150 million for the year earnings. ", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "As far as the Sikorsky spares go, I mean, on the aftermarket side, how much visibility -- how far out does that visibility go in terms of -- as you think about the impact on next year and how that rolls through, how much longer could this persist or are you just assuming that we get down to this level and stay there, any color would be great.", "Greg Hayes", "", "Yes, so a couple of thoughts there, I think, part of this again the bigger ramp that we've seen over the last five years in military spares at Sikorsky was really funded by the overseas contingency spending or funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And that is coming down and we expected that to come down. The rest of the military spares piece I would say that was just, we didn\u2019t see the bump in the third quarter that we had expected typically at the end of the fiscal year for the government. We see a large influx of orders as everybody tries to spend their budget, we didn\u2019t see that this year because of the uncertainty I would say around military budgets and what was going to happen in the last quarter of the year. ", "So I would say we should have about 50% of next year booked and we don\u2019t have much visibility into next year as we sit here today. I think that the good news for Sikorsky is that the commercial businesses is taking off, it's been very, very well, ramping up production, the aftermarket is picking up, but of unfortunately it's 20% of the business versus the [18%] [ph] which is military so Sikorsky is going to have a tough year next year. I think that\u2019s the long and short of it; it\u2019s not unexpected given the next step down in sequestration which I think takes another $12 billion out of defense spending starting in January. So it's a tough couple of years for Sikorsky.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Great, Thanks for the color Greg.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. You next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley, you\u2019re line is open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "", "Yes, thanks, good morning. So just looking at the 2014 framework, obviously there is no changes since we published in Monterey. Just looking at the question column and you\u2019ve got [subsidy price] [ph] commodities in there and no surprises in there, but based on the ramp down in copper hedge price for 2014 and I\u2019ve seen that the price remains pretty solid, what do you expect in terms of tailwind for next year, at current levels?", "Greg Hayes", "", "There should be some modest tailwind from copper going into next year, copper has come down, but I think it's still trading around $3.50 or so a pound, also we\u2019ve taken down the amount of coppers as we\u2019ve talked about it. We had a visit across all of the CCS I think, 7 years ago there is a 120 million pounds, we\u2019re down to 50 million or 60 million pound. So well copper is an important element of the cost structure, it's not as big as it used to be. We\u2019re also seeing a little bit of headwind on steel, which is going to impact both Otis as well as the CCS, but now it's kind of early. I think generally speaking I would hope that that commodity\u2019s pricing is going to move over into the positives as we get towards the end of the year, when Louis stands up and gives guidance, but we have to wait and see how those last quarter plays out.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay. And if we could say anything about the pricing side of the equation, it sounds like spares pricing is still pretty good, [inaudible] pricing looks very solid Otis seems quite negative. I'm just wondering, if we look at the backlog build that we see in Otis, what kind of margins do you see in that backlog?", "Greg Hayes", "The margin in backlog has actually started to improve a little bit in North America, again we\u2019ve got some new products out there. We have been able to get a little bit of pricing but again, not big numbers that we are talking about.", "And in China we continue to see pricing pressure at Otis on new equipment, not a surprise. Again, I think, the beauty of Otis is they continue to be able to reduce cost of the factory to offset this pricing pressure and still deliver significant margin on new equipment as a result of the scale of the factories and the relentless focus on cost reduction.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And just a quick one on fab margins, obviously very impressive there, you\u2019ve run through some of the factors. But the deconsolidation or rather the sale of Rocketdyne Power Systems, did they have a positive impact on mix?", "Jay Malave", "Power Systems maybe a little bit there, Nigel, but again by and large what we saw on that 290 was really the benefit from the aftermarket mix with the spare parts as well as the restructuring benefit.", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah. Keep in mind, when we took Rocketdyne out we restated the numbers for last year and this year. So the year-over-year doesn\u2019t really have any impact on those discontinued ops.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Good point. Yeah. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Thank you. Just back to Otis, Greg, just speaking about the South Carolina factory disruption? Can you quantify how much of that kind of played into the Q3 margins and as you look into Q4, obviously the guide kind of speaks for itself? Do you think that fully encompasses the kind of correcting issues and you have that behind you by the end of the year?", "Greg Hayes", "It\u2019s not going to be completely behind us, Jeff, by the end of the year. I would tell you in the quarter the impact was less than $15 million, let\u2019s call the penny a share from the disruption at Florence.", "At the same time, I think they are making good progress. They took overdue from 1,000 units at the end of the second quarter down to about 350 million -- 350 units rather at the end of Q3. Hope they get the overdue all out of the door by the end of the year. But some of the root cause issues, some of the systems issues and some of the other factory issues that we have seen today are still going to take some time to work through.", "Having said that, I think, what we are not going to see is a repeat next year all of the additional costs. We kept in the Gallos plant open for additional six months or so this year. That\u2019s close as of the end of September. So that\u2019s going to be tailwind for next year.", "I think, the strategy is going to work. We want to have all of the CLC, all the engineering, all the manufacturing, all the procurement all at one place down in Florence. The work force is coming up to speed. It\u2019s getting better. It\u2019s just going to take some time. But I don\u2019t think we are going to see a full run rate savings that we had expected until probably towards the end of next year there.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "So we should have a non-repeat of at least kind of $50 million of costs?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. I think that\u2019s probably the best way to think. We probably won\u2019t see big year-over-year savings ex that $50 million of costs that won\u2019t repeat. This \u2013 that\u2019s pretty significantly at Otis.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "I just wondered on CapEx also in aggregate. I don\u2019t think you said 1.6 to 1.7 before, I think it was 1.7. Not to split hairs, but are you finding ways to kind of bend the curve a little a bit on that CapEx bubble and what do you think about next year?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. So year-to-date, we spent a little over $1 billion on CapEx. So I think we spent $383 million in the quarter, that\u2019s up $65 million. We are trying to, as you say, bend over that curve. I think we are trying to keep that number closer to 1.6 and 1.7, a 75% of that spend is at the Aero units and really goes to the ramp up that we are going to see in production. We have got the 5 GTF engines. We have the big ramp up of UTAS and the consolidation of the Goodrich Hamilton businesses.", "So there is pressure on CapEx. So I think next year it will probably be the peak year which could even be up from what we are seeing this year. So, we are doing we can to try and push this capital under the supply chain. We are looking at partners for much of this work. We are doing a lot of things, I think to try and address this. But the bottom line is, there is a lot of CapEx coming in the fourth quarter of this year, you will see even more next year.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "And then finally, can you just give us a little more color on the European building-related businesses both Otis and CC. I think, Jay said field weakness in the Fire and Security organization but equipment orders, I guess, were better at Otis. Just a little more color on the lay of the land there and how things are playing?", "Jay Malave", "Sure, Jeff. Let me -- I\u2019ll go through sales and I\u2019ll do orders. At CCS, commercial HVAC was down low single digits, Fire and Security was down low single digits and the products were down slightly and the field was down low single digits. Commercial refrigeration was up slightly.", "Switching over to orders at CCS, commercial HVAC was up mid-teens and commercial refrigeration was up low single digits. As far as Otis as we said, sales were actually up in the quarter low single digits and orders were down high single digits, but for that big order last year. And again as both Greg and I mentioned, excluding these big one-time orders, it would have been up 12%.", "Greg Hayes", "If you think about it, it really -- I mean, it looks as if we are positioning for improvement here as we go into the fourth quarter then to next year as we deliver on this. So it\u2019s been a tough year, but we do see signs of stabilization, it\u2019s not getting worse. CCS, I think, we were down 2% a quarter, but again the orders would indicate that there should be recovery here in Europe, although we\u2019re not going to count on a whole lot as we go into next year. At least we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get worse.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Thank you very much.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "", "The next question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. The line is open.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much. More on housekeeping side of things for a moment. Greg, first, R&D for the year continues to trend up. How do you see that flowing out from here? I mean, you talk about a lot of work on GTF and we think you are getting closer to a peak on that?", "Greg Hayes", "The GTF actually did peak. I think what you saw at Pratt was that E&D was actually flat in the quarter. We were down $50 million year-to-date. You are going to see a further reduction in the fourth quarter at Pratt as engines get certified and we complete much of the testing.", "A whole growth in third quarter E&D was at the legacy Goodrich. It\u2019s just the fact that we had Goodrich, it was up $40 million year-over-year, so I think we are right on the plan that we had expected. In fact, Pratt we had said down 75 probably closer to down 100, which will help fourth quarter margins.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "I have never gotten a tax rate right this year\u2026", "Greg Hayes", "Me either.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "But you find things that sort of help matters. So how do you think about a normalized tax rate? I mean I recognize that some of that will be a function of repatriation and every other credit one can find.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. I think there is a normalized rate with the tax law as it stands today. I will be very specific there. It should be around 29%. The fear of course is the tax law changes next year and when we lose some of the benefits from the tax extenders like the R&D, tax credit and the CFC look through rules and everyone wants to put upward pressure between a point and a point and a half on the race. So, if you think about next year and we are keeping probably a 30.5% tax rate unless by some miracle the folks in Washington to get those tax extenders passed. But I think that\u2019s unlikely that anything is going to happen down there this year yet.", "Howard Guguel - Jefferies", "And then finally, you talk about restructuring, I think you said $150 million in the final quarter of the year. Can you sort of, can you outline a bit where you plan to target it and how are you anticipating capturing some gains?", "Greg Hayes", "But there is obviously a few things out there in terms of the gains. There is probably a little bit on the tax side. We will probably get another couple of one-time items there that will help fund some of these restructuring. But I\u2019m not counting on it. The fact is most of the restructuring in Q4 is actually going to go to Pratt, as they are again preparing for the ramp up, but at the same time they are trying to adjust their cost structure to the reality of today.", "UTAS, I think, again, you are going to see further synergy plays there with headcount and further restructuring and the same at Otis and CCS. So there\u2019s, again, that $150 million is pretty well spread across the businesses. Sikorsky is going to be teeing some things up too, I think. And maybe that number probably wants to go up, and if it doesn\u2019t go up in the fourth quarter, it will go up in the first quarter.", "Howard Guguel - Jefferies", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Julian Mitch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Hi. Thanks a lot. Yeah, I was just curious about the extent of the expansion in your gross margin. That was sort of flat to down in the first half, up almost 190 bps year-on-year in Q3. You mentioned lower commodity cost in CC&S helping. I just wondered if there was anything exceptional in that gross margin in terms of input costs or mix, or it really does reflect kind of the benefits of restructuring and is something that should be sustainable.", "Greg Hayes", "So there is a couple of pieces there, Julian. I think, again, one of the biggest pieces is the absence of the inventory step-up amortization. Last year, it was, I think, $100 million.", "Jay Malave", "$150 million.", "Greg Hayes", "$150 million in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter. So that really helped the UTAS\u2019 margins improve. As far as Pratt, the big improvement in gross margin was really the recovery in the commercial aftermarket as well as the restructuring savings from all the actions that we took in the first nine months of the year.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Got it. Thanks. And then on just following up on R&D. You didn\u2019t put in your sort of outlook for next year. Is the assumption then that it will just track in line with the sales development because you\u2019ve still got lot of legacy Goodrich stuff to catch up on?", "Greg Hayes", "No. I think there\u2019s -- if anything, E&D should start to trend down, especially on the aero side here. We are completing the 787-9. We are completing the GTF engines. Again, I\u2019m not talking about a huge step-down, but it should generally trend down over the next couple of years, which should be helpful.", "Again, there is not a lot of newer platforms, but we do have to complete all the work that\u2019s out there from the Embraer aircraft, the CSeries and the neo. So there is lot of work to do, but I think it\u2019s generally going to trend down slightly.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Got it. Thanks. And then lastly just within Otis, so I think your EMEA services revenues were down sort of low single-digit in Q2s, but that was still running at the same trend here in the second half.", "Jay Malave", "Yeah. It was down slightly in EMEA in this third quarter.", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah, I think the pressure there is not surprising. Spain is down, Italy is down, but we are seeing good traction. I think France is up a little bit. Germany is up a little bit. So, it\u2019s really the same story that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last year and a half. Southern Europe continues to be a headwind, although much, much less so than in the past 18 months.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning. The first one is clarification, just on the CMH. So eight deliveries are baked into that dime headwind is in the numbers for the fourth quarter at this point?", "Greg Hayes", "So to be clear, the eight aircraft we have assumed that we are going to shift those in the fourth quarter. But year-over-year it\u2019s actually tailwind, Myles, because you recall last year, we took $157 million charge. Those eight aircraft would go out with negative margin around the $120 million. So there is actually tailwind in Sikorsky numbers in the fourth quarter from CMH, strange as it seems.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "So, I was just thinking -- I was just saying versus your underlying EBIT guidance down to $150 million?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. That\u2019s in there later perhaps.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Great. And then, Greg, can you talk about the other operating cash flow line item? I think that $350 million negative swing this year and I think -- and some of it\u2019s the fleet management, some of it\u2019s the total revenue going the opposite direction. But can you talk about the trend for the rest of the year and also into 2014?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. I think you saw a little bit of anomaly here in the third quarter. What we saw is some higher costs in some of the fleet management programs as you noted there at Pratt & Whitney where again, we are incurring cost upfront to get these engines up to kind of rebuild to a pristine condition before they go back in the field. So those costs go on the balance sheet, it goes out of the cash flows. There was a couple other minor things in there, Jay.", "Jay Malave", "Yes. We just had some increases in long-term receivables particularly again in the aero businesses. And then just again some payments in terms of -- on some of the longer-term reserves like a restructuring-type reserves, where we are liquidating those reserves to other payments.", "Greg Hayes", "Nothing, I would say is structurally different going into the rest of the year or even to next year that I would have been that concerned about.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So into \u201814 that become more of a historical trend?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Joe Nadol of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks. Good morning, Greg and Jay. ", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "On UTAS, so your EBIT was -- adjusted EBIT was down a hair sequentially. And just thinking about this, we should have over time. Sequentially, we should be thinking about aftermarket getting I think a bit better. And we should be thinking about synergies from Goodrich getting better. So, was defense the negative sequentially? And if so, could you help quantify that a little bit?", "Greg Hayes", "", "Yeah. There was actually a couple of pieces of headwind there. And I think you hit on the biggest piece which was defense and that again, both at the legacy Hamilton business as well as there\u2019s Goodrich in the sensors business. We saw a headwind there. And we also saw additional headwind as sales picked up on 787. There is still negative margin there.", "We also booked some loss reserves associated with the CSeries aircraft, which again is a very long-term program. But as you first start up, you are high on the learning curve, so there\u2019s a little bit of loss associated there and I think that gets better over the next couple of years and those are really the three biggest pieces if you will.", "Jay Malave", "Okay. So as we think going forward into Q4, I mean your guidance implies kind of flattish EBIT again. But as we think about that going into next year, how do you think about those various pieces? Particularly, are you worried more that Goodrich defense business was just a homerun for them in the last couple of years of their independence. Is that somewhere where we could expect or fear more downside?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, again, the sensors business is not really the DoD business. It\u2019s a U.S. government business, so we\u2019re not selling as much as you might think to DoD, although there is some there. But they are clearly going to be a little bit of headwind, but this is not a huge, huge number for us next year. And I think again, we come down to learning curve on the 787 next year, so that\u2019s going to improve.", "We\u2019ll come down to learning curve on the CSeries. Sequestration will be an impact at UTAS, bigger impact in the next year at Sikorsky. But yeah, I think it\u2019s all kind of captured in there. We talked about $0.12 headwind from sequestration and probably a third of that\u2019s going to be the UTAS and two thirds will be at Sikorsky.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "", "Okay. And then just one more. I think you tweaked down your cash flow guidance from better than or equal or better than to earnings to just essentially in line with. What were the changes there?", "Greg Hayes", "", "Again, I think we\u2019ve always said, we target cash -- free cash flow net income and I didn\u2019t mean to imply that there was anything significantly different. As we get towards the end of the year, we clearly have line of sight to free cash flow or equal to net income. I think we\u2019re 91% year-to-date. Our fourth quarter is typically big from a cash flow standpoint. So, I can guarantee you one thing, it won\u2019t be exactly 100%.", "It might be a little lower. It might be a tiny bit less, but we\u2019re targeting in the range of net income, so no surprise there. I think, again, we\u2019re on track to deliver and the same thing with the guidance here. We tightened the guidance range to that nickel. We see a path to the high end, but I don\u2019t see a path above the high end. So, as you guys think about the year, we\u2019re thinking about cash flow will equal to net income at $6.15 and what we\u2019re really focused on right now is 2014.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "", "Right. I mean your guidance did change from October 1 to today in terms of what\u2019s in your slides. So, I guess that\u2019s -- it\u2019s just based on where you were.", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah. It\u2019s just based on the reality. As we get towards the end of the year, we will be a little over net income maybe, but we\u2019re not going to be at 115% of net income and I didn\u2019t want to imply, that\u2019s why we really tweaked the guidance to say it\u2019s going to be essentially equal to net income.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "", "Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of Nomura. Your line is open.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura", "Good morning, guys.", "Jay Malave", "Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "", "Hey, Shannon.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura", "", "Hey Greg, as you looked into this military aerospace weakness, I mean have you been able to sort of get a feel for how much of this could be inventory reductions and when those might sort of play themselves out?", "Greg Hayes", "", "And again, I think what we\u2019re really seeing is just a reluctance on the military services to spend on spares alone. What\u2019s most impacting I think is fleet readiness. We\u2019ve seen the BLACK HAWK readiness declined significantly because they\u2019re not working the hours, they\u2019re not doing the repairs.", "And right now it seems to be comfortable that they can take down fleet readiness. But that trend cannot go on forever. I think we would expect to see a recovery from kind of more normal aftermarket levels across all of the defense businesses next year once we get this thing with sequestration sorted out.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura", "Okay. Okay. And then just maybe a little more color on Europe in terms of the commercial businesses. I mean, Otis and commercial HVAC are seeing these better European orders. What do you make of those? Are those or are you seeing sort of a material swing go on there? Or what color do you have around what you\u2019ve seen drive it?", "Greg Hayes", "Let\u2019s be careful there, Shannon. I think, again, we are seeing a recovery, but we are still well below peak rates that we saw in 2006, 2007. So orders are coming back. They\u2019re off of really, really low levels. So, recovery is coming. It\u2019s very slow and I am not expecting it. Orders are good. They are good in Northern Europe primarily, but there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty in Europe. So we\u2019re going to be cautious. But again, I think it\u2019s all trending positively.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, Shannon.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Hi, George.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Greg, if I look at Pratt, you had big drops sequentially and even year-over-year in the large commercial deliveries. I mean, what was going on there? You had a strong second quarter, but what was actually happening in the third to be that low?", "Jay Malave", "George, that really just normalized. I think you would expect -- in the fourth quarter, we expect that number to probably jump a little bit to the 150 range in that ballpark and the second quarter was just a high quarter.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. And then the 14.4% margin, I mean obviously got helped by the lower deliveries and the higher aftermarket. Was there anything else in there, or is that kind of a sustainable kind of new level margin for a while now?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, no, again, to the earlier point, commercial OEM is going to go back up in the fourth quarter. The other piece you are missing is the restructuring thing. Pratt has taken out close to a 1,000 people this year in the first nine months and most of that came second quarter. So you are going to see that benefit continue. And again, spares should be better, so that will help. But you get little bit of an offset, as commercial OE picks back up in the fourth quarter.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Greg Hayes", "George, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Deane Dray of Citi Research. Your line is open.", "Deane Dray - Citi Research", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Greg Hayes", "Hi, Deane.", "Deane Dray - Citi Research", "Hey. On Fire & Security, could you just give us an update in terms of traction in the quarter? What it means on non-resi side and any developments on the portfolio rationalization? It sounded like there were still some divestitures that could potentially be done on businesses you couldn\u2019t scale.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. What I will do -- I can give you some data points just on Fire & Security globally. The products were up low single-digits in sales and orders were up mid single-digits. On the field businesses, those were down high single-digits in both sales and orders in the quarter. So that\u2019s pretty much what we saw on Fire & Security globally.", "Jay Malave", "Yeah. I think this is not a new trend here. Again, some of the field business, again, we have been mostly deemphasizing, but we\u2019ve been somewhat more selective as Geraud said about not taking some of these installations, which is just installing pipes, if you will, for sprinkler systems or trying to -- by higher margin, higher value add that can pull some of our product along, so making good investment on the product side and we\u2019re seeing that traction in orders. But the service side continues to be a drag especially in Europe.", "Deane Dray - Citi Research", "Great. And I might have missed this. But on the Canadian Maritime, are you -- have you made progress in the renegotiation of the contract, any closer to that resolution?", "Greg Hayes", "I\u2019m going to be very cautious here, atypical of me. But I would say that we\u2019re making progress although it\u2019s slow. And I think again, we haven\u2019t really started formal contract negotiations. Good news is the aircraft are up in the Shearwater. They are flying. We\u2019re getting traction with the customer. I think everybody recognizes they want to find solution here both at the Sikorsky and at the Canadian government level.", "So we\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s a great helicopter. And we were just down at West Palm Beach the other day I was talking to the test pilot. It\u2019s a phenomenal aircraft, but it\u2019s just going to take a little bit of time. So, I hope when Louis stands up in December that we\u2019ll have some really good news to report.", "Deane Dray - Citi Research", "Great. Thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. So thanks everyone for listening today. As I just said, we look forward to seeing you all at our Annual Investor and Analyst Meeting on December 12th in New York. We\u2019ll do the same. Last year, we\u2019ll be giving guidance on 2014 and look forward to seeing you all there.

And welcome to United Technologies\u2019 First Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.", "The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself to the queue and we will answer as time permit.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Greg Hayes", "Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning a solid finish to the first quarter with earnings per share of $1.32 and 5% organic sales growth. Earnings were little bit better than what we expected driven by the higher organic sales.", "Segment operating profit was up 9%, reflecting improvement in all five segments and operating margin expanded by 90 basis points to 15.4%. So a good start to the year, which gives us confidence to increase the bottom end of our EPS guidance range. We now expect 2014 earnings per share of $6.65 to $6.85 that\u2019s growth of 7% to 10% and an increase from our prior guidance of $6.55 to $6.85.", "Okay, turning to slide two, organic sales grew 5% in the quarter with growth in all five segments. As the momentum coming out of the fourth quarter of 2013 continued and the commercial businesses we saw 7% growth in the Americas helped by the ongoing U.S. economic recovery and we continue to see signs of improvement in Europe organic, sales were up 3% in the quarter. The commercial businesses also saw 7% growth in Asia led by China where sales were up 14% more than offsetting some softness in other parts of the region.", "Looking at aerospace, continued weakness in defense where sales were down 2% was more than offset by strong growth in commercial OE and aftermarket where overall sales increased 8%.", "Let\u2019s look at orders now on page three, overall order trends remained positive for the majority of the portfolio. Just a reminder, we will talk orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do.", "First, in our commercial businesses, we continue to see traction in North America. Despite some weather related impacts at the beginning of the year, the outlook for housing and commercial construction markets remained encouraging.", "North America residential HVAC orders were up 19% versus last year, as the housing market continues to improve and distributors stocks for the summer season. The Architectural Billing Index or the ABI trends are positive and we see that coming through in our order in August, where new equipment was up 39%.", "North American commercial HVAC orders were down 4% in the quarter, reflecting an uneven demand for large engineered systems, although, we continue to expect that business to grow for the full year 2014.", "In Europe, the economic environment is trending positively, albeit slowly. Eurozone PMI expanded for the nine consecutive month and economic sentiment is at the highest levels since about mid 2011. Unemployment continues to be near all-time highs, the deflation remains a concern.", "At UTC, CCS commercial HVAC equipment and fire and security product orders grew 15% and 10%, respectively. While Otis new equipment and CCS commercial refrigeration orders were each down about 2%.", "Okay, on China, while reports recently suggested property markets slowdown in parts of the country, we continue to see solid demand in housing and infrastructure in the first quarter. Otis new equipment orders were up 25% in the first quarter, with several large infrastructure project orders coming in the quarter.", "CCS commercial HVAC was up 10% and fire product orders were up mid single digits. So our building and industrial systems businesses continue to be well-positioned building on the strength we saw in 2013.", "Moving to aerospace, with increasing air traffic and airline profit projected to almost $19 billion this year. We continue to see solid conversions of OE backlogs and good growth in our commercial aftermarket businesses. At Pratt & Whitney commercial spare orders were up 11%, while UTC aerospace systems spares orders were up 9%. So, good broad base orders growth across the portfolio.", "We will keep a close eye on China and the other emerging markets, and continue to look for signs of further progress in Europe. The order rates and microeconomic trends broadly support our assumption to organic growth as we move through the year.", "Okay, let\u2019s go take a look at the first quarter specifically now on slide four. Full reported sales increased 2%, as 5% organic growth was partially offset by headwinds from net divestitures and FX. On the FX side, the benefits from the year were more than offset by headwinds and other currencies.", "Segment operating profit grew 9%, operating margins increased 90 basis points, including the benefit, of course, from pensions. CCS saw solid drop through and continues to drive cost reduction, where operating profit grew 15% with margin expansion of 200 basis points.", "Aerospace systems at Pratt & Whitney expanded margins by 170 and 80 basis points, respectively, each on the higher commercial aftermarket benefits from cost reduction actions, as well as pension.", "Earning per share $1.32 that\u2019s down 5%, a segment operating profit growth of 9% was more than offset by $0.20 of net restructuring headwinds in the quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2013 we had $0.11 sense of net gains, while we saw $0.09 of net restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2014 as we invested in cost reduction initiatives ahead of some expected gains around the middle of year. Absent the impact of gains and restructuring in both this years and last year earning per share were up 10%.", "Free cash flow in the quarter was 83% of net income, capital expenditure was $333 million that\u2019s up 13% versus last years as we continue to invest for ramp-up in commercial aerospace and working capital grew by $521 million in the quarter, driven primarily by an inventory build to support sales growth in the year.", "We also acquired $335 million stock under share repurchase program and we expect buyback at similar out here in the second quarter. Let me stop there for now, I\u2019d like to talk more about the full year but first let me turn over Jay who will walk you through the business unit results.", "Jay Malave", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to page five, Otis sales improved 7% at constant currency in the quarter with new equipment sales up mid-teens including solid growth form all areas, most notably double-digit growth in China, the Americas, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, service sales were up slightly.", "Operating profit was up 1% at constant currency. The positive impact from higher sales volume was partially offset by continued pricing pressure and carryover cost associated with the North America factory transformation.", "New equipment orders were up 11% with double-digit growth in China and North America. EMEA orders were down low single-digit. For the strong order book and near-term completion of the factory transformation in North America, Otis expects to see improving performance as the year progresses. Guidance for the full year remains unchanged with profit expected to increase $100 million to $150 million and mid single-digit sales growth.", "On slide six, climate controls and security increase the profits 15% in the quarter on flat sales, resulting in another sharp increase in margins up 200 basis points from prior year to 15.1%.", "Organic sales were up 3% in the quarter benefiting from product and marketing investments. On a regional basis, the Americas business was up mid single-digit, driven by 21% growth in the residential HVAC business, some of which was due to earlier stocking by distributors for the cooling season from what we experienced last years.", "Europe is turning the corner and was up slightly led by growth in commercial HVAC. China was up high single-digit, while Asia overall was flat driven by softness in other Asian countries and Transicold was up 7%.", "Profit growth in the quarter was driven by strong conversion on organic sales, as well as restructuring and net productivity gains driven by ACE and operational excellence. Orders for global commercial HVAC equipment were up low single-digit.", "Order for global fire and security products were up high single-digit, partially offset by a decline in the fire and security field businesses. Transicold orders which tend to be more choppy were down high teens. With solid results in the first quarter, we continue to expect profit growth of $225 million to $250 million on mid-single digit organic sales growth at CCS.", "Turning to aerospace on slide seven. At Pratt & Whitney, organic sales were up 4% in the first quarter as commercial sales growth across the businesses more than offset declines in military. Including the divestiture of power systems, sales were down 2%. Large commercial after market sales were up 10% over last year\u2019s first quarter which was the weakest of 2013.", "Operating profit was up 4% driven by higher organic sales, lower pension cost and restructuring savings which more than offset headwinds from adverse large commercial OE mix, the power systems divestiture in the absence of last year\u2019s contract close out at partnership settlement benefits.", "For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney\u2019s operating profit to be up $175 million to $200 million on most single digit sales growth. UTC Aerospace Systems delivered a solid quarter with 17% profit growth on 6% higher sales. Sales growth was driven by higher commercial volumes, with OEM up high single digit and aftermarket up 10%.", "Overall, military sales were down low single digit with military OEM flattish and military aftermarket down mid-single digit. Year-on-year profit growth was driven by higher commercial aftermarket volumes, continued synergy traction, pension tailwind and higher income from licensing agreements, partially offset by headwinds from higher engineering spend and new program OE growth. Operating margins expanded 170 basis points to 17.3%.", "Orders for commercial spares grew 9% on a year-over-year basis with strength in both parts and provisioning. For the year, we continue to expect profit growth of $300 million to $350 million on mid-to-high single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.", "Turning to Sikorsky on slide nine. Operating profit grew 8% on 9% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 48 aircraft including 36 based on military platforms and 12 commercial. The sales increase was driven by higher international military and commercial OE volumes.", "Operating profit growth was driven by higher sales volume and net favorable contract performance adjustments in our military business partially offset by unfavorable aircraft and aftermarket mix. During the first quarter, Sikorsky, the Turkish government and key Turkish aerospace suppliers signed a licensing and manufacturing agreement for 109 multimission aircraft to be used by the Turkish government. For the full year, we continue to expect flattish operating profit and high single-digit organic sales growth.", "With that, let met turn it over to Greg for wrap up.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. Thanks Jay. So solid start to the year. We continue to achieve significant milestones in our programs and secure key wins for the future. At Pratt & Whitney, IAE reached a new production milestone in February when it shipped its 6000 V2500 engines.", "We also continue to see strong demand for the GTF engine with new engine offerings wins at ANA and Tiger Air in additional orders at the regional jet market on both the Embraer E2 and the C-Series platform. Customers clearly see the advantage of our engine and have placed firm and option orders for over 5300 engines to date.", "On the military side, Republic of Korea announced its selection of the JSF as its next generation fighter jet. Korea\u2019s commitment to purchase 40 F-35A conventional take-off and landing aircraft will bring expected international deliveries to over 700 aircrafts.", "At aerospace systems, the segment recently announced a long-term agreement with Lufthansa Technique, maintenance repair, overhaul services for aircraft interiors, products, sensors and integrated systems on the Boeing 787 aircraft. We also recently extended our care program Singapore Airlines which provides repair services, asset management. The airlines expanded fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft.", "Also in the quarter, Sikorsky announced the entry into the service of the S-76D. As Jay mentioned, Sikorsky also signed agreements with the Turkish government to supply 109 T-70 helicopters, which are variants of Sikorsky\u2019s S-70i International Black Hawk.", "On U.S. government side, prospects for the Combat Rescue Helicopter, VXX Presidential Helicopter program remains positive. The firm decision is expected around the middle of this year.", "Okay. Let\u2019s talk about CMH for just a second. We continue to make progress on the CMH program and we\u2019ve recently executed the second Principles of Agreement with the Canadian government which now defines a final configuration for the aircraft as well as the phase delivery schedule which allows for the retirement of the Canadian seeking helicopters beginning in 2015.", "We also now expect that the final cost of the aircraft will be significantly higher than previously estimated as a result of additional requirements, retrofit costs and expansion of the program schedule. We continue to negotiate the financial impact of these program changes for the Canadian government but we would expect to record a charge this year associated with the acquisition contract upon the completion of the definitive agreements.", "We expect the charge will be largely offset by other one-time gains, beneficial items during the year. We\u2019ll provide an update later in the quarter as we work to finalize the agreements and complete our analysis of total program cost.", "BIS or Building & Industrial Systems had a very strong first quarter with combined organic sales growth of 5%. Integration activities continue to progress well and the CCS and the Otis team continue to look for ways to serve our customers more efficiently and offer integrated high value systems.", "We\u2019re pleased with the continued CCS momentum, the return of profit growth at Otis and the overall growth prospects for the business. And we continue to win orders in key emerging markets.", "Now, this is 25% order growth in China included large orders for the Shenzhen and Chengdu metros. And CCS was awarded major maintenance contracts for the fire safety and HVAC systems of the New Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal in Hong Kong.", "We continue to expect the combined capability of CCS and Otis and the new Building and Industrial System organization to further accelerate top line growth. So, just as you heard from the presidents in March, each of the businesses is well-positioned in our core markets and continued innovation will allow us to drive long-term organic growth.", "Okay. Taking a look at the rest of 2014, no real changes when we told you last month. The compares get tougher as you move through the order trends and end markets are essentially in line with our expectations so far. First as we\u2019ve seen with recent development in the Ukraine, things can change quickly. But as I sit here today, we remain confident in our updated guidance range at $665 million to $685 million with the path towards the high end and sales were about $64 billion.", "And we continue to expect quarterly earnings per share growth of about 9% to 10% per quarter, absent the impact of gains in restructuring will remain throughout the year. We continue to invest in restructuring. With visibilities to some additional gains and good payback restructuring projects across the business, we now expect to spend about $375 million on restructuring this year, all offset by one-time gains.", "In the first quarter, we spend $125 million. We would expect to spend to be relatively level loaded for the rest of the year. Gains however should come largely in the second quarter. Strong cash generation remains a hallmark of UTC. Although pressured by the increase in CapEx and working capital in 2014, we continue to target free cash flow equal to net income for the year. We\u2019re going to maintain our placeholders of $1 billion for each of share repurchase, debt paydown and M&A activities.", "Looking ahead, we remained focused on growth and execution in 2014. We\u2019re well positioned in our end markets and we\u2019ll continue to leverage our industry leading franchises in global scale. UTC portfolio is poised to take advantage of the commercial aerospace growth and organization megatrends over the next decade.", "So with that, I will stop and open up the call for questions. Stephanie?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Hi. Thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning Julian.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Good morning. I just had a question on Otis. Because I guess in Q1, you had organic sales growth in line with the full-year target of 6%. The EBIT was flat, though. So I guess what's giving you the confidence that, with a given organic growth run rate the rest of the year, you can get the EBIT up? Is it just that the U.S. factory relocation costs were again a very big headwind in Q1 and that drops out or is there something in the mix that you're expecting?", "Greg Hayes", "There\u2019s a couple of pieces here, Julian. I think the Florence factory transformation. It was a headwind but a small, small headwind this quarter. I think less than $10 million so, drove a little bit of headwind. Really the biggest issue was continued pricing pressures that we saw around the portfolio and you think about it, where the growth came in the quarter, we had 16% growth in OE and only 1% growth in the service business.", "So it is the pricing pressure around OE that is pushing margins down a little bit and causing us to see, I would say tepid growth on the op profit side here in the first quarter. But it will get better during the course of the year and we expect service to improve, to come down the cost curve and the equipment will get cost reduction in the factories. We will see some of the benefits from the integration of BIS, so all those things give us confidence. We are still on track from $125 million to $150 million of profit growth for the year.", "Jay Malave", "$100 to $150 million.", "Greg Hayes", "$100 to $150 million, correct.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks. And then within I guess, BIS overall, you were targeting, I think around mid-single digit growth for the year. You did 7% growth in Q1. What\u2019s your sense on the sort of non-residential markets in North America specifically? Is that trending in line or you\u2019ve seen kind of choppiness there through last year?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, there was really, I would say two different stories in North American non-res. Clearly on the OE side, we are seeing very, very solid growth in the commercial construction side of the business. Again, that\u2019s been driven by again the ABI above 50 here for most of the last year and really solid momentum in the commercial building space.", "On the CCS side, specifically on the carrier side I think Jay mentioned a little tougher compare there on the orders for the carrier commercial business and down about 4%. But keep in mind, little different business there, that is primarily 80% of retrofit business and only about 20% relates to new building construction. So we are seeing traction, I think our new buildings. I would also point out that the OTIS new equipment business fell much more dramatically than the carrier commercial business during the last downturn. So, I still think we will see growth in commercial business in carrier for the year, slight growth and we expect the order trend momentum at OTIS to continue as well.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Just a couple of quick ones. One, with respect to the pricing pressure at Otis, I wondered if you might kind of give us some color there. Has that intensified or eased at all, what\u2019s been your sense on that this quarter versus what you talked about last year?", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t tell you there is any trend change there. We continue to see pricing pressure in most of the markets for new equipment as you can imagine. But China remains the most competitive of all of the new markets. We continue to see pricing pressure there. North America, a little bit better. Again, we\u2019ve got new products that have come out and we\u2019ve done very well in terms of market penetration and pricing looks to have stabilized at least in North America. In Europe -- well, it is Europe. I mean, it\u2019s a tough, tough market. So, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen an inflection here but I don\u2019t think we have seen any improvement in pricing.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Okay. Great. And on the military front with respect to the down 2% number, you quantified the numbers in UTAS, but I wondered if you might speak to the declines you called out in Pratt and then at Sikorsky, given obviously what should be a pretty tough aftermarket compare there?", "Jay Malave", "Sure, Carter. At Pratt & Whitney, the military business was down low double digits. The OE business was down high teens and the aftermarket business was down low single digits. At Sikorsky, the military business, the O.E. was actually up as well as the aftermarket.", "The O.E. was up on the back of the international deliveries to higher international deliveries. The aftermarket was up, as I said in my remarks that there was a performance adjustments, contract adjustments. It impact profit as well as impact sales. So that business including that was up around 10%.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "If you exclude the adjustment, what would the growth rate have been?", "Jay Malave", "It would have been more, I think flattish.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Okay. All right. Thanks for the color, guys.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay, Carter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Could you speak a little bit more to our Pratt spares? I guess, first of all, on the mix versus the legacy 4000, 2000. And then just thinking about the year, the comps get a lot tougher starting this quarter and so do you expect to be up as we look and I know you are not going to give quarterly guidance for this one line item but maybe more on the profile?", "Jay Malave", "So let me start with some of the data points and orders. The PW4000 and V2500 were both up. The PW2000 was down. But if you recall in the fourth quarter, we had a significant amount of orders for the PW2000 for delivery in 2014. So the book-to-bill on 2000 was well above, around 1.5.", "As far as going forward, it is really -- as far as what we see is, is really not much of a change in our expectations for mid-single digit growth for the year. As Greg mentioned during his remarks, traffic is still flowing well, airline profitability is still strong. We are seeing a little bit of higher content per shop visit as we start the year, but again these things change. So there will be no significant change to expectations for the full year at this point.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then just secondly, on Transicold, sales up nicely but orders down quite a bit, Baltic Dry Index was down, was down pretty significantly in Q1, so this is a pretty quick turn business. So when you think about profile, particularly margin profile for CCS for the rest of the year, how is this is going to have an impact?", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah. Clearly, I think we\u2019ve got some headwind going into Q2 with CCS. I think container was down more than 50% in orders in the first quarter but again sales were up. And so to your point, it\u2019s a very short cycle business. We still see the trend for refrigerator transport on a positive basis, up probably 3% to 4% this year. So it\u2019s lumpy in the orders and I wouldn\u2019t panic about the Transicold as they sit here in April. I think it was a year ago, we went six months without orders in the container business and then all of a sudden, it was gangbuster so. We should really focus on the longer term prospects. I think we are well positioned with great products as well as continue expanding markets.", "Jay Malave", "Joe, our expectations for the year are not overly aggressive. We are expecting for the total Transicold business to be up low to mid-single digit. So we are not banking on big growth in that business this year.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. If I might sneak just one more quick one in, Greg, you have $375 million of restructuring to offset now, plus what seems that it could be couple $100 million - I don\u2019t know in a $100 million range plus of CMH charge, so could you give a little color on the gains that you are expecting to generate?", "Greg Hayes", "I wouldn\u2019t go -- I would tell you this. We do see gains out there, adequate gains to cover what we think is the range of potential loss on the CMH. The good news of CMH is with this new contract, I think we get a big chunk of the acquisition cost behind us, change in the way we account for this going to a cost-to-cost basis. So it gets it behind us and we have the flexibility with some things that we\u2019ve got in the pipeline to be able to cover most of that costs. So as I think about guidance, $665 million to $685 million, still very confident even with the CMH charge.", "Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "", "Good morning, folks.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Just a couple of things. Just on resi HVAC in the U.S., just little peculiar that people would be stocking early, it seems that there is something going on there where stocks extraordinarily low and any other color you would shed on that?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, I think as we talked about most of last year, the dealer stock was relatively low on a historic basis. If you look at inventories today, it looks like they were up about 20% as we headed the first quarter, which is in line with of course 19% growth we saw in U.S. res business. Again, dealers are procuring for what they think is going to be a very strong summer season and despite these weather issues that we saw in the first quarter I think people are generally optimistic.", "Housing starts were trending positively in over a million. And keep in mind that this is still an 80% add-on replacement business. Only 20% really goes to res and new construction. As the U.S. economy picks up, I think everybody has got confidence, we are going to see a very strong start to the season here. It\u2019s early though, so I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves here. We still expect good growth but clearly not at that 19%, 20% that we saw in the first quarter.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "And often it's kind of tough to really know what's going on with pricing this early in the season. But what do you see playing out on pricing, both in resi HVAC and in commercial HVAC this year?", "Jay Malave", "All right. The visibility that we have, Jeff, is little bit of benefit in pricing on residential side. I don\u2019t have visibility on the commercial side but a little bit of an uptick that we saw in the quarter.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Okay. And then finally from me, I was just wondering if we could come back to Otis and service. Is service price also declining or your comments strictly around OE equipment? And I am wondering if you\u2019re seeing any firming in service in Europe at all.", "Jay Malave", "Yes. Service is still tough in Europe. We are still seeing some price headwind, especially in the southern markets. I think service was down even in France this time. Again, it was offset, it was good in Germany, it was good in U.K., it was good in Russia. I think what\u2019s most encouraging, as I think about Otis and service, we\u2019ve been talking about this for several years, as we\u2019re getting really good traction in China. Last year the service business in China was up about 20%. First quarter, it was up almost 20% in service. And last year, I think we added about 50 branches or depots for service. We\u2019re going to add another 50 this year. We are getting traction there. I think again this issue of pricing in Europe, again we think it\u2019s going to stabilize as we go throughout the year. We\u2019ve seen signs of that, but the future of service for Otis is going to be in China. That\u2019s where the growth is going to come and that\u2019s where we are focused right now.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Back to Otis again, in terms of the phasing of the quarters as we go through the year, are you expecting it to continue to be all the EBIT growth to come into the second half and Q2 to be relatively flat year-over-year on an EBIT basis?", "Greg Hayes", "That\u2019s probably right. You might get a little bit of growth here primarily -- again, as you think about where the cost reduction is going to come in the factories, or the cost reduction is going to come in terms of some of the integration activities that BIS is undertaking, we are seeing mostly cost on the front end and then you picked up the benefits on the back end.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Okay. Back to CMH, so, Greg, are you implying now that the contract -- new contract that we\u2019re going to have here it\u2019s going to be restructured to the point that you can actually charge off the entire loss that you were going to see with new deliveries, so we won\u2019t have this $14 million per unit hit on a go-forward basis?", "Greg Hayes", "Let me try to explain this as simply as possibly. We\u2019re going to go to a percentage of completion accounting or cost to cost. So we will write off about 70% to 75% of the acquisition cost, or the losses on the acquisition contract this year because we\u2019re about 70% to 75%. There is some small tailwind in the next couple of years as we complete deliveries, but it\u2019s not in the order of -- it\u2019s nowhere near what we\u2019re talking about before kind of it\u2019s $120 million plus a year, it\u2019s substantially lower.", "On top of that, we will start to see the benefit of the ISS contract kick in \u201915 and \u201916 to offset some of the losses. So the goal here is to get most of the bad news behind us I think by adopting this accounting which we think is probably a more realistic look in terms of the way the contract has been restructured gives us the opportunity to do that.", "David Strauss - UBS", "And just as a last follow-up, what does this due to the Sikorsky guidance for the year, I think the flat EBIT number had baked into that $120 million loss?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, obviously they had a $120 million baked in and we run through the segment results. So whatever the charges there, the gains aren\u2019t coming at Sikorsky, but the cost certainly will. So as you think about Sikorsky guidance that we\u2019ve given, it is next CMHP, except for the $120 million that\u2019s baked into the forecast.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you. Actually I want to follow a little bit more with respect to what David said. I mean, Greg, if I understand, you have built almost all the helicopters already. So the charge should be -- I don't know if $350 million, $400 million the way to think about it when you affect this accounting?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, I am not going to get into the exact number. The reason is, as I mentioned earlier on, we renegotiated say the scope of the aircraft. So the aircraft will be more expensive because of the increased requirements and the spec changes that we are making. We\u2019ve got some retrofit cost and all of them previously contemplated. So the total cost for the aircraft is going to go up. And as I said, we are 70%, 75% done with the total acquisition contract. So it\u2019s a good trade here. I think we are pretty confident that we\u2019ve got the wherewithal to recover this.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "I mean forever today, I have been hoping that. I mean, because when you look on the balance sheet, it's over $800 million of sort of capitalized costs, if I'm not mistaken, related to this contract at the moment.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, actually over a $1 billion but who is counting. I mean, I guess, but keep in mind, so we are still negotiating with the customer on this contract. We are not done yet. So we got to finish the contract negotiation which should be in a couple of weeks. We\u2019ve got to go through that and do a bottoms up estimated complete for the whole contract. I think when Louis stands up at EPG by the end of May, we should be in a pretty good position to give you guys a number. And clearly if it happens after that, we will let everybody know as soon as we do what the impact is there.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "I appreciate. That\u2019s a big help. The other thing that\u2019s important has been that you have been working a lower cost in lot of the other businesses. Could you address some of the actions that UTA has done to drive out its cost? I mean, clearly, there were some profitability related to pension and spares, but you are also trying to lower the recurring cost of what you are doing to become even more competitive?", "Greg Hayes", "UTA, I think you are referring to UT Aerospace Systems as opposed to UT Automotive?", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "You and I have been around too long.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, I think so. There is a couple of things I think you mentioned. We\u2019ve got some good news out of pension in the first quarter. We continue to get good news out of cost reduction on the products. We are coming down the learning curve on the 787. I think we are up to 10 ships sets a months on 787. So driving cost down there. Also, we continue with some of the synergy savings. We are going to get about $100 million of incremental synergy savings during the course of the year, but there is probably $25 million sitting in the first quarter. So all those things that Alain and Dave Gitlin and Mike Dumais talked about month ago are all coming to fruition, really good margin expansion. Obviously, the pension was a little bit of a one-timer, we got a benefit here in the first quarter, but still on your line a good solid cost reduction, good execution across the aerospace systems business.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "And then lastly I noticed you had about $100 million of divestitures or proceeds from divestitures, can you characterize them a little bit, and are there some other businesses that continue to keeping the call busy?", "Greg Hayes", "I think actually these were keeping us a really busy because primarily this was -- I think, yes, this is part of the whole portfolio rationalization that Geraud has been talking about for the last three to four years and nothing big on the horizon, a couple of small fire and security related businesses, but nothing significant. I think there was a guarding business as well that was divested in the Far East, but there are really nothing terribly significant.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning, Sam.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Greg, you mentioned that the majority of the gains are going to be coming in the second quarter. I know you don\u2019t typically like to give any sort of the quarterly run rate, but how should we be thinking about the size of the gains that are going to exceed the restructuring in the second quarter?", "Greg Hayes", "While we talked about $375 million of gains for the year to offset the restructuring, all $375 million will come in the second quarter as it relates to the piece that is covering the restructuring. As far as the gains to cover the Sikorsky charge, there will be a little bit in the second quarter, and then some in the third and fourth.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Okay. And then just going back to some of the comments around the Europe, I think the building and industrial systems being up 3%, you\u2019ve guided Europe to being up slightly. And so I am trying to just think you just talked about Otis service really hasn\u2019t improved. So where is that improvement and at what point are you prepared to talk about Europe, perhaps being a little bit better this year than you\u2019ve had in the outlook?", "Greg Hayes", "Probably in December. I think Europe has been better. Again, we have seen strength in Northern Europe on the new equipment side. I think I mentioned on the service side as well. So a good order traction in Northern Europe. Southern Europe remains a concern. I think orders were down in Spain, Greece, Italy. So again, it\u2019s this balance, but I think generally we\u2019re looking consumer sentiment, it\u2019s up across the continent, unemployment remains high, but things are getting better. I just don\u2019t want to declare victory. I think right now first quarter positive signs. We look at auto sales are starting to pick up. Interest rates remain very low. All of those indicators are there that we should see a recovery. So absent again something bad happened in Eastern Europe to upset the apple cart. I think we feel pretty good about the projections that we\u2019ve got right now.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Okay. And one last question, the $660 million increase in inventory, you said it\u2019s supporting sales growth later in the year. So when we look at the year end, should we expect inventories to be flat with where they were at the end of last year?", "Greg Hayes", "That is the plan, Sam. I think Inventory was up a little bit, I think the issue will probably be at Sikorsky on the CMH program and continue to add, Pratt\u2019s starting to add inventory as they start to ramp up for production on C-series on the A320neo. So it would be a little bit of inventory growth, but the growth that you saw in the first quarter although was across all the businesses, you should see most of that start to come back in the cash flow as we go through the year.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America", "Good morning, Greg. Just maybe a follow-on to Howard\u2019s question, how should we think about M&A? I mean, you hinted at the investor meeting up in Connecticut that you guys like bigger M&A/ How should we think about that over the next say 12 to 18 months? Is UTC contemplating doing something, I mean how do we think about it?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, in very simple terms, I would say I think there is no big deals this year as we sit here and however this is April, but thought of actually consummating a big deal this year is very unlikely. But we continue to look and I think there will some smaller deals less than probably $1 billion for the total year still, again primarily in the CCS side of the business or the BIS side. And then as we will continue to look for those opportunities of scale, we want to do things that fit into the core, but that will capitalize on the global scale.", "We are going to continue to buy back shares this year as we have talked about, and if there is opportunity without an M&A, maybe we will take share buyback up again towards the end of the year. But right now, we are focused on this normal long-term goal, and pricing is very difficult on the M&A market today. We bought Goodrich back in 2011. Timing was very, very good. Interest rates remain low, but today prices are up as you know on in the equity side and everybody wants a 30% premium which makes these deals very, very difficult.", "So we are going to continue to look for value, but I can tell you with underlying strength in the business we do organic growth, I am not in a hurry to spend the share or money at deals just to grow, we don\u2019t need to buy growth. We will buy opportunistically, we will buy for value and we will buy on the core.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America", "Okay, great. And then just second question, changing gears a little bit. When we think about the gear turbo fan, and you're starting to move into a period here with we are not too far away from the A320neo going into service. And how do you -- how are you guys going to recognize profitability on those engines, right? Because my understanding is you're selling with something like 80% of them was power by the hour contracts. So will it be different -- won't it be different than what we currently see with the V2500, or is that going to go?", "Greg Hayes", "", "Yes. Right now, again, it\u2019s a little bit in a state of flux because I think there was a new revenue recognition standard coming out from the FASB in May that\u2019s supposed to be due our last year which is going to cause us to re-look at how we recognize revenue. But as we state here today, we are going to continue to recognize revenue the way we always have to commercial engine business which is, as we ship an engine, we will recognize the revenue or we will recognize the loss on the engine when we ship. We don\u2019t have the ability that Rolls-Royce does to smooth earnings over the life of a aftermarket and OE contract, where you can look at a 20-year aftermarket revenue stream and its normalized margins. That\u2019s just not allowed under U.S. GAAP and it won\u2019t be allowed under the new revenue recognition standard either. But once this new rev rec standard comes out, we will take a look at it. It\u2019s not adopted till 2017 which is just coincident with the big ramp up that we are going to see in the GTF production. So we got time. We will take a look at it and see what the impact is. It will impact some of the other businesses because it will force us to go to percentage of completion of some of the military programs, some of the Black Hawk, but again, little early to worry about that.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America", "Okay. And then if I can just sneak in one, quick one. It\u2019s my understand in the quarter, your China orders, I notice were up 27% and in that, I mean, I think you guys have two big China orders. I mean if you were to exclude kind of two major orders out of China, how would we think about of that?.", "Greg Hayes", "That was about half of the growth came from infrastructure projects and not just those two, but broadly speaking, half was infrastructure , half was on the property side.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America", "Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay, Ron. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Thanks so much. Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Hey, Rob.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Greg, just a quick aftermarket question, should we read anything into the slowdown in new order growth in the first quarter is that just the normal timing ahead of the price increase?", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah. The first quarter is typically the slowest quarter for order growth as you mentioned we increased prices of catalogue prices. January 1, catalogue is published I think October 1. So, yeah, we saw big ramp up in fourth quarter orders across the aero business. So first quarter I think we feel pretty good about it.", "Again, this is all driven continued RPM growth, where, I mean, the airlines are flying the aeroplanes, the airlines are making money and they are bringing the engines back to be repaired and we are seeing actually, I think the most encouraging thing is content per shop as they are starting to trend more positively.", "So I think it all feels pretty good and look, we don\u2019t expect this trend, we are not going to grow 16%, this for the rest of year, but we still feel very confident of the guidance for spares for the year.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "And then, secondly, on the share buyback, you are also trending ahead of that overall annual amount Q1, you said you are going to see the same in Q2? Is there any sort of strategy behind this or is it just availability of cash?", "Greg Hayes", "Either early. I think the key of course is, quickly you buy the shares back, the better this average share count is for the year and we got the cash sitting here we took advantage of that, we bought back most of these shares early in the first quarter. We are buying back shares through 10b-5 program today in the marketplace and that we will probably do that again in the third quarter, trying to get ahead of this.", "And then if we get to the fourth quarter, where we will probably spend all the share buyback by the end of the third, if cash looks good and there is no other big M&A opportunities out there we will probably take share buyback up again just like we did last year. I am talking a big number but a little bit.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Yes. Thanks so much. So follow-up on CMH, so, Greg, was the total expected loss higher than it had been before as a result of the new contract?", "Greg Hayes", "As I said, Cai, the total cost of the aircraft is going to go up and you\u2019ve got new specifications from the customer, a little bit higher retrofit cost and the program is going to last a little bit longer the acquisition. So it will go up and again, I am not prepared to tell you exactly how much because quite frankly we are not done negotiations. I just know as I sit here today is going to be higher and I think we will clarify all that.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay. Right. But so before kind of its look like roughly 335 if we kind of do the rollout and for contract of this size, I mean, it kind of sounds like this total number could be in the area of $500 million to $600 million and if the quarter of it is still in front of us, is it unfair to assume that we have got another 100, 150 something in that order of magnitude in front of us in \u201915 and \u201916?", "Greg Hayes", "Hey, Cai, you get way ahead of me here. Look until we get the contract actually negotiated and until we know what the total contract value is going to be both the aftermath and the OE all the trades are made, before we get the EAC done, I really can\u2019t comment, all I know is the aircraft is going to be more expensive, as I said, we are 70% to 75% done, again depending upon what this retrofit look like. So I am going to say out of the math work today and I will let my boss do that for you hopefully in May.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And then just back maybe to the principal, so we basically split those into two contracts, which is kind of equipment and then aftermarket support, so that the aftermarket support portion of this should be profitable? Is that the right way to think of it?", "Greg Hayes", "That has always been the case, Cai. I think we have already said, money in this contract at least for the last five years, it has been the aftermarket contract that provided the shield if you will for the losses on the OE and that's not going to change.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And then the last one, the GTF with kind of the slip on the C-Series, how many units are we looking for this year? And give us some color on the expected build in unit production, maybe in \u201815 and \u201816?", "Greg Hayes", "You talking delivery this year, Cai?", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Yes.", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah, you talking small numbers, you probably in the range of less than 10 shipments this year, its small numbers.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "And how does that build in \u201815 and \u201816?", "Greg Hayes", "Though mentioned -- I'm going to say, if you think about the run rate production is somewhere between 36 and 48 aircraft a year and build over the next several years. Again I think originally planned about 20 aircraft this year or 20 deliveries this year. It will build next year but I got to tell you the real ramp will be starting at the end of the next year on the Neo, whereby 2017 will be delivered 500 plus engines a year. So C-Series is our very important customer but the volumes are going to be very small compared to what we\u2019re going to see on the Neo.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Terrific. Thanks so much.", "Greg Hayes", "Thank you, Cai", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Hi Doug.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "At CC&S, you had $43 million in restructuring costs in the quarter. And that's higher than we've seen in some time. What's the focus of the restructuring at CC&S and what should we expect to see over the course of the year?", "", "Greg Hayes", "The biggest piece of the restructuring for the quarter was actually factor that we had outside of Milan called Villasante where we made commercial -- I\u2019m trying to think what\u2019s the right word for it, (indiscernible). And again, we\u2019ve been downsizing that facility for a number of years. We finally, in the fourth quarter -- first quarter here agreed with the Works Council there on a plan to close that facility. Again that was a relatively large portion of the charge with some other headcount related actions and some smaller things around the globe but Villasante is probably the biggest piece of the restructuring in the first quarter.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "So they\u2019re going on later in the year, we shouldn\u2019t see that level, I assume?", "Greg Hayes", "There will be additional restructuring across the CCS. Again I think the most of the factory actions, I think are done. I think what you going to see is more VIS integration related activities as we closed offices and consolidate some of the facilities around the globe. And again, most of that would be Otis but some will leak into the CCS segment as well.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And then at UTAS, you said that E&D was higher in the quarter and what\u2019s driving the increase right now? And how do you look at the E&D trajectory going-forward for UTAS?", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah. It was higher but we\u2019re talking to small number less than $10 million of growth in E&D for the quarter. Really, if you think about everything that\u2019s on the plate at UTAS, you got obviously the A350, the C-Series, the Neo, the 777X now. I mean, all of these new programs are driving their requirements, thus 787-9 with the -10 coming up. There\u2019s all sorts of fun things to do there and they all are spread a little bit higher engineering expense. So engineering, we think it\u2019s more fun loaded, we think for the full year total across the all businesses will be relatively flat but little bit higher here in the first half.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "So you\u2019re not looking at a -- sort of as you take the 787-8 up, I mean there\u2019s enough work on 787-9 and 787-10 that we shouldn\u2019t see this come down very quickly over the next 12 months to 18 months, is that fair?", "Greg Hayes", "I think the pipeline is pretty full at aeropace -- I mean both at the Pratt & Whitney ate the Aerospace Systems Group. I think the engineering pipe is pretty full. Remember we\u2019re going to get done with the C-Series this year, entering into revenue service, hopefully towards the end of the year or early next year. And you\u2019ve got the Neo, you\u2019ve the got the Mitsubishi regional jet, you got Irkut up there and then you got the Embraer airplane coming after that. So engineering spending, it will come down gradually perhaps, as all these aircraft could certify same kind of profile which you\u2019re going to see at the aerospace systems business.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura. Your line is open.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura", "Morning guys.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura", "Hey, Greg. Just maybe a little more on this disconnect between Otis and commercial HVAC in North America. I mean, up 39% on Otis, down 4% on commercial. I mean I hear your point about the retrofit but that's still a pretty big difference. I mean, is there anything else you see going on in terms of the lag in the market or I know you were coming out with some new applied products; is there anything going on there? It just seems like probably even adjusting for this retrofit point, you made a little bit of a wider gap than you would think?", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah. I think, we continue to have -- see really good traction of the late commercial roof tops. I think again where we are lagging or we have lagged for number of years is on the implied side. To your point, we have new products in the pipeline, new products coming out that we think we\u2019ll address this as we go through the year, that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident as we begin. The sales will pick up on the commercial business as we move through the year, as we get these new products out there but clearly the issue has been on the applied. This is not a new phenomenon. The small rooftops continue to be very good business for us, good share but little bit behind on the applied side.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura", "Okay. And then just following up on your point on China service really being the story for Otis going forward, did you have to take any more additional actions there to kind of gain critical mass? And have you seen any meaningful shift in the willingness to pay OEs to do this service?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, I think this is about investing for the future. I mean, you got to continue to add service technicians. You\u2019ve got to continue to add infrastructure, offices and depots. Yeah, Otis has been making investments for the last two years now. There had a couple of thousands people into the service, little workforce over there. This will just take time. You also have to remember the way we go to market there and China is a little bit different because our biggest business was with Sheitzo.", "As we go through agents and we don\u2019t get the same attachment rate or conversion rate there, we are working with the agents to make sure that we can capture more of that service revenue and find a win-win with the agents to capture that going forward. So, I think we\u2019re getting good traction. It\u2019s going to be investment for us for a number of years. But the margins will continue to improve as we get better route density and as we expand the footprint there in China.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Greg Hayes", "Hey, Myles.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Maybe one quick clarification on CMH. Just for 2015, as you look at it in isolation by everybody that built in a loss on the delivery of a set of aircraft, is your baseline assumption now that we are in a better position or worse position or neutral position to that, Greg?", "Greg Hayes", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a worse position, but I really can't tell you exactly where we are. I think, again, the idea here is to get a big chunk of the cost behind us this year to eliminate most of the headwind but I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m very reluctant Myles to go out there until we get this thing negotiated to give you a final number.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then the other clarification or maybe color I wanted was on the F-35, those fan failure and the fix that's ongoing. How is that affecting your deliveries or progress, your recognition on the contracts? And where is the kind of the escape trajectory from here?", "Greg Hayes", "Yeah. I think, we\u2019re on track with the F-135 engines. We had good deliveries in the first quarter. We continue to come down the cost curve. There was an issue on test stand. We talked about that. And I think, again, we understand the root cause, we are working on all that. So again these things happen. There was an engine that was a long cycle endurance. And we are clearly on track with the development of the technical aspects of that engine. It\u2019s fixed.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. Thanks, Myles. All right. So with that, let me just wrap up and first of all, I wanted just to maybe a little housekeeping here. And first of all, welcome Casey Forrest to the IR Team. Casey is joining us from Financial Planning Groups. Casey will be on the phone with you guys later today.", "I want to thank Josh Banis for his three and a half years of service to the IR Group here. He has done a great job. Many of you know him. I hope you wish him well. He's off to get a real job as a CFO of our Actuation and Prop business over in the U.K. So, wish he and his family well. So with that, thanks very much for listening and look forward to hearing from you guys today. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.", "Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items, as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. Thank you, Stephanie and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release today, UTC reported solid third quarter earnings per share of $2.04 and 5% organic sales growth. Gains, net of restructuring was $0.22 in the quarter, which is higher than previously expected largely due to the timing of some tax settlements in the third versus fourth quarter.", "Excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items, earnings per share was up 12% and segment operating margins expanded by 60 basis points to 17.2% in the quarter, that\u2019s a record for UTC. With three quarters of the year now in the books, we can look back at a pretty good start, 4% organic growth and earnings per share up 11% year-to-date excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. As a result, we remained confident in our 2014 EPS expectation of 675 to 685 as earnings growth of 9% to 10% on sales of about $65 billion.", "Okay. Turning to slide two, organic sales. You can see organic sales grew 5% in the quarter with solid growth across all five of our businesses. In the commercial businesses we saw 5% growth in the Americas led by 9% growth in North American residential HVAC as the U.S. economy continues to improve. In Europe, where the economic recovery is uncertain, organic sales were up 1% in the quarter. The commercial businesses also saw 7% growth in Asia. In China specifically sales were up 9% led by Otis, which was up 12%.", "Shifting to Aerospace, for the first time this year, we did see growth in the military business which was up 3% led by development programs at Sikorsky and solid growth in commercial OE and aftermarket continued where overall sales increased by 9%.", "Okay. Slide three. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our end markets. Overall trends remained positive for a majority of our portfolio. And just a reminder, we\u2019re going to talk to the commercial businesses on a constant currency basis as we typically do. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see momentum in North America. U.S. consumer sentiment reached to 14 months high in September on employment gains and optimism over wage growth.", "As I mentioned before, North American residential HVAC sales were up 9% in the quarter and orders were up a multiple of that, very strong, but driven primarily by early order activity ahead of the [014] standard change that goes into reflected January 2015 for the southern and western regions of the U.S. Positive ABI trends continue and the outlook for commercial construction remains encouraging. And we saw proof of that in Otis where the North American new equipment orders were up almost 60% in the quarter. In Europe, a little different story, Europe zone PMI was 14-month low, although it did remain in modest expansion territory. And economic sentiment fell to a 10 month low in September as concerns over the economy increased. We\u2019re obviously keeping a close eye on the economic situation in Europe and we saw mixed orders there in the quarter. Commercial HVAC orders were actually down 11%, although we did see 15% growth in commercial refrigeration, and fire and security product orders grew by 12%.", "Shifting to China and Otis, new equipment orders were flattish versus the prior year, reflecting the lower conversion of pipeline opportunities to book orders. However, new equipment backlog continues to remain strong at Otis and up 14% versus the prior year. Orders for CCS commercial HVAC and fire products were both down slightly in the quarter.", "Earlier this month in a move to bolster the housing market, the Chinese government cut mortgage rates for second home buyers and lowered down payment rates to 30% from 60% to 70% previously. This actually marked the first time since the 2008, 2009 financial crisis that mortgage rates were reduced in China and signals the government\u2019s continued willingness to use fiscal policy to support growth. While we continue to expect growth in China will moderate, it should continue to outpace global GDP. And our Building and Industrial Systems businesses remain well positioned in the region.", "Moving to Aerospace, with robust airline profits and ongoing growth in air traffic, we continue to see solid conversions of our original equipment backlogs and growth in our commercial aftermarket businesses. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were up 7% in the quarter and large commercial engine spare orders were up 1%.", "In our Aerospace Systems business, commercial aftermarket sales were up 10% and commercial spares orders were up 11%, reflecting strength in both parts and provisioning.", "You\u2019ll notice on that chart that we\u2019re highlighting the new metric beginning this quarter that is commercial aftermarket sales for both Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems to better reflect the evolving business model from a transactional parts sales business to a comprehensive service business. We\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that on slide four and you can see that illustrated for Pratt.", "Ten years ago only 10% of our engines were covered under our fleet management program or an FMP. As you can see we\u2019ve migrated, last year about 50% of the Pratt fleet was under an FMP. And this is going to continue to increase with time. The next generating engines, the GTFs were up about 80% of those engines covered under FMP or fleet management program. This creates value for our customers, the airlines as well as Pratt & Whitney. We\u2019re incentivized with the airlines to keep the engine on wing as long as possible and to improve reliability. As we\u2019ve entered into these FMPs, our customers have seen a significant improvement in reliability of the engines, because we were able to maintain those engines at an OEM standard.", "So, over time we\u2019ll see a gradual decline in the transactional spare parts business, as the legacy fleet starts to retire. The good news is that you\u2019ve got the V2500 fleet and the new GTF fleet replacing those spare part sales with FMP sales. So, again, a changing business model and we\u2019ll continue talking about aftermarket sales growth going forward for both Pratt and Aerospace Systems, as it\u2019s a more meaningful metric.", "Taking a closer look at the third quarter results, total sales reported increased 5% that\u2019s all organic, segment operating profit was up 8% and operating margins increased by 60 basis points including the benefit from pension. CCS saw the benefit from organic growth and cost reduction initiatives, where operating profit grew 9% leading to margin expansion of 110 basis points. Pratt & Whitney Aerospace Systems each expanded margins by 130 and 110 basis points respectively.", "Earnings per share of $2.04, that\u2019s up 32% and of course that benefits of a $0.22 of favorable one-time items net of restructuring cost in the quarter. Recall the third quarter 2013 have $0.08 of net restructuring charges. So absent o the impact of these items of both 2013 and 2014, earnings per share were up 12%.", "Free cash flow in the quarter was 83% of net income. Capital expenditures were $415 million and that\u2019s up 8% versus last year as we continue to invest for the ramp up in commercial aero. And investment and working capital grew in the quarter as well. We acquired $425 million of our stock under our share repurchase program and we now expect to buyback another $400 million in the fourth quarter and that will bring share repurchase to a total of about $1.5 billion for the year.", "Let\u2019s stop there now. I\u2019ll be back to talk more about the full year and provide a glimpse of how we\u2019re thinking about 2015. But first, let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the segments.", "Jay Malave", "Thanks Greg. Turning to page 6, order sales improved 4% in the quarter led by a high single-digit new equipment sales growth most notably in China in the Middle East. Service sales were up low single-digit overall with solid mid single-digit growth in our businesses outside of Europe where we saw a slight decline in service sales in the quarter.", "Operating profit was up 3% at constant currency. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by contribution from volume and net productivity offset by continued pricing pressure. New equipment orders were up 4% in the quarter. New equipment orders in China were flattish reflecting a slower conversion of jobs in the pipeline to actual book business. We were encouraged by results in other areas especially the Americas where orders were up sharply for both the quarter and year-to-date, whereas new equipment orders in developed Europe were up mid single-digit in the quarter.", "The recent strengthening of the dollar is creating headwind on Otis profit and we now expect profit to be up $50 million compared with previous earnings growth guidance of $100 million to $125 million. On a constant currency basis, we still expect Otis to grow profit by about $100 million for the year.", "On slide 7, Climate Controls and Security increased profit 9% in the quarter and 3% higher sales. Margin expanded by 110 basis points from prior year to 18.2% continuing the CCS momentum and margin expansion.", "Organic sales were up 4% with growth reported by all regions. We saw strength in the Americas with the residential HVAC business reporting 9% growth and commercial HVAC up mid single-digit. Outside of the U.S. both EMEA and Asia reported low single-digit growth. Commercial refrigeration was up mid single-digit, while Transicold was up slightly.", "Profit growth in the quarter was driven by contribution from organic volume, as well as benefits from restructuring and integration savings. CCS global equipment orders were up 5% excluding the impact of the shift in order timing driven by the pending U.S. regional cooling efficiency standard change.", "Orders for global fire and security products were up high single-digits more than offsetting flattish fire and security field businesses. Transicold orders were up low single-digit. Based on year-to-date results, we continued to expect profit growth of $225 million to $250 million for the full year at CCS on low single-digit organic sales growth.", "Turning to Aerospace on Slide 8; Pratt & Whitney delivered solid results with 15% operating profit growth and 5% higher organic sales resulting in a 130 basis points of margin expansion. Higher aftermarket sales across the businesses including 7% combined growth in large commercial and Pratt Canada aftermarket more than offset declines in military OE.", "Operating profit was driven by higher commercial aftermarket sales, favorable pension and restructuring benefits which more than offset higher E&D. The quarter also benefited from favorable aftermarket contract performance and licensing agreements which exceeded similar benefits from 2013. Large commercial spares orders were up 1% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially, building up the 7% sequential improvement in the second quarter. Year-to-date overall commercial aftermarket sales are up high single-digit, as industry fundamentals and demand remained solid. This supports our full year sales growth expectation for the commercial aftermarket business of up mid single-digit despite more difficult year-on-year compares as we close the year.", "Given the strong year-to-date performance, we now expect Pratt & Whitney\u2019s operating profit growth to come in at the high-end of the previous guidance range of $175 million to $200 million on low single-digit sales growth.", "UTC Aerospace Systems recently celebrated the second anniversary of its formation following the July 2012 acquisition of Goodrich. We are proud of the way that teams come together to integrate the businesses, while improving on our already high level of customer service, as well as delivering over 350 million in run rate synergies in just over two years.", "In the quarter, aerospace systems continued to deliver strong results with operating profit up 14% on 7% higher sales. Commercial OEM sales were up 8% as we continue to benefit from growth in new programs such as 787 and A350. And commercial aftermarket increased 10% while military sales improved for the first time this year, up 2% versus 2013.", "Profit growth was driven by higher commercial volume, continued synergy traction and the benefit of lower pension expense. Operating margins increased 110 basis points to 17%. Commercial spares orders increased 11% in the quarter with strength in both parts and provisioning. Overall commercial aftermarket sales are up 10% year-to-date.", "For the year, UTC Aerospace Systems now expects profits of $325 million to $350 million from our previous expectation of $300 million to $350 million on mid to high single-digit sales growth.", "Turning to Sikorsky on slide 10, operating profit decreased by 11% and 5% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 54 aircraft, including 39 based on military platforms and 15 commercial. The sales increase was driven primarily by development programs as well as higher international military and commercial OE volumes, partially offset by lower aftermarket and U.S. government OE volumes. The operating profit decrease was driven by unfavorable mix in our military business, the impact of lower aftermarket volumes and the absence of prior year favorable contract adjustments which more than offset benefits from pension, lower engineering spend, and cost reduction actions.", "For the balance of the year, we anticipate stronger profit growth from higher volume and continue to expect operating profit growth of about $25 million on low single-digit sales growth.", "Earlier this month, Sikorsky unveiled the S-97 Raider prototype featuring X2 technology. And we are pleased to announce that the Sikorsky Boeing team was selected to continue development of the Sikorsky Boeing Defiant Demonstrator aircraft with first flight expected in 2017. We believe our technology is well positioned for the next generation future vertical lift program.", "With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks Jay. So in summary, I think all we can say is that really solid quarter for UTC and what the difference a quarter mix. You\u2019ll recall the second quarter there were some concerns around organic growth and development program execution. I hope that we put all that to rest with our performance this quarter, where we saw solid organic growth across each of the businesses with good bottom-line conversion and key development programs on track as well as major program awards which will drive top-line growth in our businesses four years to come.", "Just take a minute and highlight a couple of the big wins in the quarter. As you know of course Pratt & Whitney and our Aerospace Systems business supported the maiden flight of the Airbus A320neo aircraft now on September 25th in Toulouse. All of our systems including the geared turbofan engine performed well on this historic flight. We\u2019re confident that the plane test program will further validate the performance characteristics for reduced noise, lower emissions, and significantly higher fuel efficiency; and we look forward to the continuation of that successful test program.", "I\u2019m sure you also all saw the announcement from Gulfstream last week. We\u2019re delighted to see the introduction of the PW800 engine for the new Gulfstream G500 and G600 long-range business jets and yet another platform for our engine business. The PW800 engine is optimized for long-range business jets ensures the same proven vigorously tested core technology used in Pratt & Whitney\u2019s award winning pure power family of commercial engines. We\u2019re equally pleased with the Aerospace Systems content. We\u2019ll provide several critical systems for these new business jets. The Building and Industrial Systems businesses also had a solid third quarter with Otis and CCS delivering 5% and 4% organic sales growth respectively.", "As you know the third quarter marked the one year anniversary of the formation of our Building and Industrial Systems business and integration activities continue to progress well. In the quarter, we saw another example of revenue synergies in Australia to Sydney Airport. At Sydney Airport, Otis has had a long-term maintenance contract which allowed CCS to win a contract covering the installation of detectors, fire indicator panels, and emergency warning systems across one domestic and one international terminal in a five year service contract for maintenance and repair work across the airport site. BIS does work. As you can see each of the businesses is well positioned in our core markets, we\u2019re delivering real value to our customers and securing key orders that will drive top-line growth well into the future.", "All right. Take a look at the rest of the year. As you know, the compares will get tougher in the fourth quarter but order and end market trends through Q3 continued to support our expectation, a 4% organic sales growth for the full year. As I mentioned in the start of the call, Q3 gains were stronger than previously anticipated and this was driven mainly by U.S. tax settlement that closed a few weeks earlier than expected, moving gain from Q4 to Q3. We continue to anticipate that net one-time gains or restructuring costs will offset for the year. And we see the path to the high end of the range of 675 to 685 although there is some pressure given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar.", "For the year, we continue to anticipate debt pay-down of $1 billion and we now expect share repurchase of $1.5 billion, up from our prior expectation of $1.35 billion. And we expect the M&A spend will be a little less than $1 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow is 82% of net income and cash is generally strongest in Q4 as you know. We expect free cash flow of about 90% of net income for the full year of 2014.", "Okay. Moving on to slide 12, let\u2019s take a look at 2015 briefly. As we move to any year, of course there is some positives out there, there is some headwinds and a lot of question marks, but let me touch on a few of the big ones here.", "A couple of things that we know are going to be headwinds next year, commercial, aero, OE margins both at Pratt & Whitney, as well as in aerospace systems business. As we ramp up production on the GTF, we\u2019ll see some margin headwind at Pratt. We\u2019ll also see a little bit at aerospace systems as production rates increase on the new platforms. And as you would expect, the margins on early units going out the door are pressured with the learning curve. These are great long-term programs and point to a bright future for both Pratt and our aerospace systems business and are key building blocks for our long-term strategic plan.", "On the military side, the biggest issue here is the C-17 program. Pratt, as you know supplies the engines of the C-17 for Embraer aircraft. Volume that will decline this production ends next year. So that will be a headwind as the F135 Engine production has not yet ramped up.", "Looking at the middle column here, some questions; first of all, what happens in Europe? When do we see a sustainable recovery there? Emerging markets, now we put China in that category. You know they will grow, the question is how much will they grow? Pension as you know was also a big driver of UTC and if we were to snap the line at the end of September, the discount rate was 4.2% and it will give us a headwind of about a $160 million next year. As you know every 10 basis points of discount rate change there is nearly $30 million of earnings impact year-over-year.", "On the positive side the pension portfolio has performed well and should offset the discount headwind of 4.2. I put it in the question mark column because it\u2019s too tough to call when rates will be when you snap the line on December 31st. We also expect the new mortality rate tables to be introduced in the coming months. While it\u2019s great that we\u2019re all living longer, this does increase pension expense by about $180 million a year. Just not clear yet whether this starts next year or the year after. So we\u2019ve got a question market as we sit here today.", "In the plus column, first of all we think the U.S. economy will continue to recover, even if the phase is slightly rising interest rates. And our businesses have good, solid momentum here. Commercial aero aftermarkets, as well as the business of general aviation should continue to benefit from solid fundamentals and of course cost reduction.", "Since 2009 and through the end of the last year, we\u2019ve done some $2.6 billion of restructuring. We\u2019ve got another $375 million this year, which will give us a couple of $100 million of tailwind into 2015. So as always, some pluses some minuses and a few question marks as we look towards next year.", "As we see here today in this challenging and uncertain macro environment, earnings for next year look to be around the mid single-digit mark, but it\u2019s still early and we continue to work on the plan for next year.", "We\u2019re executing the long-term strategy that we presented earlier this year at our March Investor day. The portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of the urbanization and commercial aerospace megatrends through the end of the decade and beyond.", "The investments that we\u2019re making today position us for sustainable earnings growth well into the future. We\u2019ll continue to leverage our industry leading franchises in global sales and we believe we\u2019ve got the right strategy, right portfolio and we\u2019ve made the right investments to continue to drive sustainable long-term earnings growth.", "With that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Stephanie?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Hey, good morning gentlemen.", "Greg Hayes", "Hi Carter.", "Jay Malave", "Good morning", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Just a couple quick ones. First with the decline in the service sales in Europe at Otis. Was that related to pricing or something else? I think you\u2019d said previously that the pricing had kind of stabilized there; did that change given the change in the macro environment there?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes Carter, we still continue to see some pricing pressure there; it\u2019s moderated from what we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of years, but there is still a little pricing pressure on the portfolio. I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job in terms of stemming the tide there; we\u2019ve got some new programs out there trying to be a little more aggressive in terms of the retention of the portfolio, but still a pretty tough environment on the service side.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Can you characterize the magnitude of the pressure relative to what you\u2019ve seen in the past couple of years?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, you\u2019re talking less than a penny in the quarter of pressure from pricing.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Okay, great. And then with respect to SEER-14 transition and the order trends that you talked about, can you help us think through beyond the order trends in terms of production and shipments, and how that impacts Q4 versus Q1? My collection was that you -- this was whenever -- they could be manufactured in Q4, but shipped in Q1. How are you thinking that that\u2019s going to work out as the year-end purchase?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, I think that\u2019s exactly right. I think we saw a really, really strong order growth on the resi side and we don\u2019t actually think that that\u2019s indicative of what\u2019s going on in the market; it\u2019s probably closer to the 9% growth that we saw on the sales for the quarter. The plan as we see here today of course is to manufacture all of these SEER-13 units that have been ordered and most of them will sit in inventory through year-end and we\u2019ll ship them into the first and second quarter of next year. So, you\u2019ll have a more, I\u2019ll say steady state in terms of what the market really looks like as opposed to 2005, where we had the big like 1 million unit pre-order across the industry and there was huge shipments in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re not planning to do that. That obviously has an impact on inventory of probably 150 million or so of additional inventory that we\u2019ll see on the books at year end. But the fact is we don\u2019t want to push this out to the distribution if the ruling that it\u2019s just going to sit on the shelf. So again, good solid order growth rate. We think again share is with the remaining work that we expected to be. So, there is no big bump this year in the fourth quarter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Okay, great. Thanks Greg. I\u2019ll pass the mike.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks Carter.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Hi. Thank you. Just on the aerospace businesses, I think R&D had been up; company funded about 4% in the first half, a lot of that was in UTAS. And you talked before about flat R&D for the year as a whole. So I just wondered how is R&D in UTAS in Q3 and how are you thinking about it for the next sort of 12 months.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. In fact if you think about the plan going into the year was that E&D was going to be relatively flat. I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s not going to happen. It\u2019s probably going to be up about $100 million across all of UTC and really that\u2019s the aero units. The big increase in the quarter that we saw I think was about almost 50 million. That\u2019s all Pratt & Whitney. UTAS was relatively flat year-over-year in the quarter but we\u2019re going to continue to see a little of additional E&D into the fourth quarter but I think about that as 100 million or so year-over-year. And then again benefit next year as we expected that to go back down to prior year\u2019s level.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. And then at Pratt restructuring the last six months has been very low even though the two minus points you call out in the 2015 outlook, both pertain to Pratt.", "Greg Hayes", "Again, keep in mind, Pratt has done a significant amount of restructuring in the last three years. It did a 20% across the board reduction on SG&A at the beginning of last year. We continue to take cost out closing for space both in Canada and here in the U.S. So I think they have done what they needed to do from a cost reduction standpoint in terms of the back office and the factory footprint. The cost reduction focus today at Pratt is all on the new products going out the door. So again, I think you won\u2019t see big restructuring dollars but what we\u2019re doing is obviously focusing on GTF cost reduction to hit those target costs that we have out there as the production ramps.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. And just very quickly, you don\u2019t call out anything on the balance sheet in the 2015 outlook, but I guess share count is a small tailwind exiting this year. Anything else you\u2019d like to say on the balance sheet for \u201815?", "Greg Hayes", "That\u2019s a little early; I think Louis will probably talk about it. The only thing I would point out that is obviously, share count will probably increase a little next year, absent share buyback because of the -- what we call those? The convertibles, MSUs that are out there, so we\u2019ll issue I think 11 million shares 1st of July. Obviously we\u2019re going to probably have share buyback that will try and offset that but full year share count might creep up a little bit next year.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "All right, thanks.", "Greg Hayes", "", "Thanks Julian.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open. ", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Thanks guys. Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning, Rob.", "Jay Malave", "Good morning Rob.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Greg, I was wondering if you could carry on the previous thing, wondered if you could talk about your plans of debt retirement and any sort of impact that could have on the income statement next year.", "Greg Hayes", "So again, we have some debt that\u2019s coming due I think in May that\u2019s of 6%, no doubt there. The thought is that again we probably just refinance that on the short-end with commercial paper. So again, we\u2019ll pay down a $1 billion of debt this year just exactly as we had expected to do. But next year, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see further debt reduction.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Okay. And then on the commercial aerospace aftermarket, in the past you\u2019ve given us a little bit of a breakdown of Pratt in terms of the trends you\u2019ve seen in the B2500s versus the wide body engine, I was wondering if you can give us that again? And also at UTAS, I was wondering if you could break out how much the provisioning might have added in the quarter? Thank you.", "Jay Malave", "Sure Rob. On for spares in terms of the orders, the B2500 was up, the PW-2000 was up and the PW-4000 was down. As far as you can see aerospace systems as far as orders both the parts and provisioning were up around the same amount of the overall order rate. And on the sales basis, parts were up mid-teens, were up high single-digits and provisioning was up over 20%.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Great. Thanks Jay.", "Greg Hayes", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Greg, if I heard you correctly so basically you are pointing us towards kind of mid single-digit EPS growth in 2015, obviously there is long list of pluses and minuses. Just on the ones that you do have dialed in a little bit better, I just wanted to make sure I was clear. On pension are you telling us that asset issues offset discount rate and therefore the head one, if there is one is simply on mortality table?", "Greg Hayes", "That\u2019s exactly right. I think if we snap the line at the end of the September despite a lousy September in the market, the pension performance is going to trump the discount rate down at 42, but snap the line today, of course the discount rate is 4%. So that\u2019s, I\u2019m just going to ignore that for now. The real issue is whether we adopt mortality tables; we\u2019re waiting for them to be published. If they get published this year, we\u2019ll probably adopt them. If they get publish early next year, we\u2019ll wait and adopt them in \u201816.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "And your comment about earnings growth next year assumes the mortality tables adopted?", "Greg Hayes", "It assumes that the mortality tables adopted, yes. So right now it would be a headwind, but I put it in question column because again it\u2019s middle of October as opposed to middle of December. So whenever we stand up we\u2019ll obviously have some clarity there.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "And it sounds like you\u2019ve got a pretty good dial on Pratt margins or headwinds next year, obviously unforeseen challenges on ramps can occur. But can you give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019re pointing us to there, kind of what the ramp pressures look like, I don\u2019t know if you can express it in dollars or margin points or what?", "Greg Hayes", "Maybe the best way to think of that, Jeff is, you\u2019ve got a couple of big known headwinds that is negative engine margin, that\u2019s on the V2500, as well as the GTF primarily the Neo is that inner service at the end of next year. And so we know that\u2019s out there and it\u2019s a pretty good size number and as well as the U.S. military, if the C-17 production stops, we make good money out of that both on the OE and on the support side of that.", "So that kind of goes way next year, but you do have some offsets, I think obviously the commercial aero aftermarket will be better, Pratt Canada continues to get better, you got good news probably on the E&D front.", "I think right now I would tell you that if Pratt will struggle to grow earnings if at all and that\u2019s really the challenge that we have in the next couple of months is to understand. Pratt right now is certainly there is no growth there and I think that is probably our biggest challenge for next year because of these big headwinds.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "And just one more and I\u2019ll move on. So it had the questions in the discussions about aero ramp CapEx and working capital and you have some working capital noise in carrier here at quarter-end, would you foresee conversion actually moving back above net income next year or what kind of net income be the reasonable bogie?", "Greg Hayes", "I think net income is a reasonable bogie. I think obviously like even this quarter, we had 83% of free cash flow to net income, we had about 400 million of gains or one-time items that flow through that had no cash impact. So, there is a little bit of noise outside of just the pension. Obviously pension becomes less of a tailwind next year but also from a cash standpoint, there is no cash coming in from pension good news anyway. So CapEx going to come down a little bit next year. So all in all I would say, I think we ought to be targeting as we typically do free cash flow equal to net income, always bumps in the road as we put the plan together. But I\u2019m pretty confident when Louis stands up, he\u2019ll be guiding towards that 100%.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next quarter comes from Joe Nadol with JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Joe Nadol - JP Morgan", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Greg Hayes", "Hey Joe.", "Joe Nadol - JP Morgan", "Just a couple on Otis to start. So the guidance for profit growth is lower exclusively because of currency or is there anything else in there?", "Greg Hayes", "Currency is the biggest driver; it\u2019s about $50 million year-over-year of headwind. I think again, the pricing pressure that we talked about in Europe earlier continues to be a bit of a headwind but it\u2019s not the big driver, really it\u2019s primarily FX. Again, I would say Otis is recovering, the Florence factory is doing much, much better still some room to go there but there is no big operational misses here. It\u2019s really just pricing in Europe I would say in FX.", "Joe Nadol - JP Morgan", "", "Okay. And then on China, on Otis China, can you tell us about that unit orders year-on-year? Was that also flat or was there a change there? And maybe just provide some color on what you\u2019re seeing more qualitatively as we head into Q4 and into next year of course.", "Jay Malave", "", "So the units were up in the range of mid single digit. So, we continue to see growth in units year-over-year. The other piece of it is, we still see strong award activity and just as a reminder, we do not record orders until receive a deposit. So there has been a little bit slower converting the awards into booked orders from a cash conversion and deposit perspective but the activity still remains pretty solid.", "Greg Hayes", "I think keep in mind Joe, the backlog still up 14% year-over-year, so I think the sales forecast that we have for the year is solid. And we should continue to see solid growth next year despite what is we all recognize a very or slowing housing market there. The Chinese government is taking some steps here with reducing down-payments on second homes to try and stimulate some growth there. But it will be challenging. It is a 600,000 unit elevator market though, just keep in mind it\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest bio-factory or probably five. So it\u2019s a huge market and the opportunity there as you know is going to be on the service side long-term and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re focused. And I think service will probably grow 20% or so again this year, after growing 20% in each of the last two years. So, the team is focused on service and delivering service across the entire region which is again a big challenge but that\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.", "Joe Nadol - JP Morgan", "Okay. And then Greg, I just wanted to clarify one item which is the Pratt guidance, I don\u2019t think I heard you say this specifically but are you guys going to stop providing guidance or color on spares specifically and just move to aftermarket because I understand longer run, as you\u2019ve moved to 80% type of pick up on service contracts that\u2019s going to be maybe the more relevant benchmark, but in the near-term the next couple of years just one-off spare sales are still going to be extremely important?", "Greg Hayes", "We will be transparent on the spares order; we put it out there in the press release, not trying to obfuscate anything but the fact is we know spares will continue to be growing or declining as the retirements kick in on the 4000 and the 2000. So, we wanted to put both metrics out there. The point of this is that longer term, we really need to start thinking about commercial aftermarket as opposed to just the spares, because as you know the fewer spares we sell, the better we are on the FMP contract.", "So, during the -- for the next couple of years, we\u2019ll continue to report both spares and commercial aftermarket; just understand, again the point here is there is a transition here in the business model of Pratt that is significant. And we think again an opportunity for Pratt long-term on the margin side.", "Joe Nadol - JP Morgan", "Okay, very good. That makes sense. Thanks.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks Joe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Hi, Sam.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Just wanted to go back to one question, you mentioned about China and the elevator mark, and you talked about some of the stimulus. I thought there are also some movement towards changing some of the world\u2019s in terms of the aftermarket contract that might help the OEM do a little bit more. So, can you talk a little bit about where that stands and what your attachment rate has been in terms of some of the more recent selling there?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, I think again, this is a regulatory change that had started to get rolled out last year, it\u2019s been rolling out province by province. This is a requirement that the OEMs actually do service on the elevators. And as a result again, you are seeing that the increase that we\u2019re seeing in our aftermarket attachment. I think we\u2019ve got about a 135,000 elevators under service contract in China today versus 110,000 last year. So, we\u2019re gaining good traction. The regulatory change that will be slow to be adopted, I would say across the country, but it is a net positive trend for us.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "Okay. And then just on Sikorsky, I was wondering if you could clarify something, if you are going to generate $25 million growth in terms of adjusted profits this year, it seem to imply a very strong fourth quarter. I just want to make sure I understand that. And related, just want to -- if you could talk a little bit about the energy market, the commercial helicopter demand right now?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. That\u2019s -- okay. Well, let\u2019s just talk about Sikorsky; they\u2019ve got a big fourth quarter as they typically do. I mean we have about $2 billion of sales at Sikorsky in the fourth quarter. So, growing -- I don\u2019t know they\u2019re down a little bit year-to-date but the $25 million will be well within the reasonable range of what they can deliver for the full year again on a strong fourth quarter delivery.", "As far as offshore oil, we actually had a conversation with them yesterday about this. They are seeing some pressure because of offshore oil and with fracking in the U.S. growing so significantly, we\u2019re seeing less of the oil and gas exploration expansion. We should drill in the big ramp up in commercial helicopters. We\u2019re going to deliver 40 S92s this year; we\u2019ll probably deliver a couple of more than that next year. Is there still a market for the helicopters, it\u2019s just we\u2019re not seeing quite the same growth because of the prevalence of fracking here in the U.S.", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo", "That\u2019s great. Thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Jay Malave", "Good morning.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Just Greg, I wanted just to go back to the \u201815 I guess framework and obviously a big question mark around the magnitude of the OE mix headwind. And I\u2019m wondering can you just put -- give us some sort of working range on that because it is a key to take. And I\u2019m wondering around that, will there be an impact from the collaboration of accounting orders primarily just UTS. And is there a second chance in \u201815 where you get the OE ramp up and the headwind, but not a corresponding reduction in R&D?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, I think again the R&D is almost a natural reduction if you think about it. We\u2019re going to be done on C series flight tests, we\u2019ve got the engine certified, the Neo engine certified, you\u2019ve got MRJ right, we just rolled that out. You\u2019re going to see just a natural progression of E&D coming down over the next few years. Still have some spending out there, you\u2019ve got the Embraer E2 jets, you\u2019ve got your jet. But should just be a natural roll down in E&D to a more I\u2019d say normal level. As far as the commercial OE, the headwind, I guess the way to think of that is probably somewhere around $0.10 to $0.12 a share for next year maybe a little more than that, but kind of in that range.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And is that just key example or is that also including some collaboration accounting?", "Greg Hayes", "It\u2019s not collaboration. There is some additional [Vs] some new [Vs] out there that weren\u2019t included in the contract when we bought the shares so those new engines will go out with some negative margin as well.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just quick one on pension, Greg, you mentioned possibly adopting the new timetables this year, but does that put any incremental funding pressure for the next year if it does get adopted?", "Greg Hayes", "No, I think with the new pension rules that our friends in Congress passed, we don\u2019t actually have to fund until sometime in 2020. I would tell you though we\u2019ll probably fund its service cost level for the next few years. As you know, we have sunset the plan, the old FAE plan and we took that really tough action back in 2009. And that\u2019s been paying off. But as we switch to the newer pension scheme, the cash balance then probably funding that at a normal more service level going forward. So you think about $300 million or so of cash next year for pension funding in the U.S and probably a couple of $100 million for international.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Great. A quick one on the euro rate for [4Q], what\u2019s the euro rate you\u2019re using for Otis in \u201815?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, I think we\u2019re 127 in our current forecast which is right about where we are today. It can drop a little with 128 yesterday; it came down a little today. So, and I think we\u2019re in kind of in the ballpark now. Recall last year going into the year we\u2019re kind of in the 130 range and for the full year we were at 133 this year. So, there is some certain FX headwind year-over-year going into the fourth quarter.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks Greg.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks Nigel.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much. Greg, one of the things you talked about was the opening or the difference between restructuring and gains; could you refresh us on where you are then for the fourth quarter?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. So, we spent in restructuring $243 million, not to be terribly precise; $375 million forecast for the year, maybe we\u2019ve got about a $132 million of additional restructuring teed up in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s all subscribed; we\u2019ve got plans in place to spend all of that. And in fact there could be some additional gains in the fourth quarter; we\u2019ll see what happens with the taxes. We also got tax expenditures out there that could happen in the fourth quarter which might allow us to do some additional restructuring. So, as we talked about the plan for next year, one of the keys is one additional cost reduction, restructuring actions can we take to help ensure we have a decent plan going into next year. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to focus on in the next couple of months is looking for additional restructuring opportunities. And don\u2019t be surprised if that 375 goes up a little.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Yes, because the reality -- sorry the reality is that without that you\u2019d actually do a little bit better than the high-end of your range for the year.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. So again, I don\u2019t think there is any -- look, we\u2019re going to stay within the range as I said before, we have a path to 685, it\u2019s a little tougher with this big currency headwind we\u2019ve got in the fourth quarter but there is still a path out there. But I would not look for us to significantly over deliver on the basis of additional gains.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "No, it wasn\u2019t gain so much but the absence of -- I get it. Just to stay for a moment on restructuring, could you provide some indication of the successes you\u2019ve had combining CCS and Otis internationally?", "Greg Hayes", "I think the biggest -- from a restructuring standpoint, the biggest success is, I think about Otis has 2,500 branch offices out there. And the ability to consolidate offices, I mean it saves a lot of money. I think Geraud\u2019s got a target about of $300 million of savings from the synergy of collapsing the offices and running the business as not just Otis, not fire and security and carrier, but as BIS.", "So, you have one back office, you have one management team. Again sales forces are all different, field service is different, but you are getting synergies out of the consolidation of the offices.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "And then just one last if I may, when I look at your tax rate, we call it 30% versus your peer, there are other large multinationals, they all have something that begins with high 20s. Going forward, is it possible that we could see a tax rate in the -- I\u2019ll use 28% plus range.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, it\u2019s hard to imagine us absent of course with tax reform power, anything is possible. And again, I think that\u2019s the real issue. Our tax rate normally wants to be about 32%. We do some tax planning that allows us get it to down to around 30% that\u2019s primarily reinvesting foreign earnings. But the fact is the rate wants to probably be around 30 absent to tax extenders. You get the R&D tax credit and the CSC it looks it will drop the rate about a point. We\u2019re obviously hopeful we\u2019re going to see something in December from Congress on that to hopefully make permanent the R&D credit, because it\u2019s crazy the way to spend money in anticipation of a tax law change.", "So, that\u2019s an opportunity. But again as the tax rules become more and more difficult and you\u2019ve heard of this BEPS project out there where everybody is looking for additional tax revenue, the tax authorities around the world are becoming more aggressive. We\u2019ve taken a relatively conservative view on the tax rate, we can certainly drive it down for a year two, but we\u2019re viewing this it a little long-term; it probably wants to be 29% to 30%.", "Howard Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you, Greg very much for your time.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks Howard.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Hi Greg. There was a comment in the press release on increased revenue synergies realized in building industrial systems. I wonder if you can give a little bit of color behind that, kind of substantiate the rational of the combination and also give us some color on the hunt for larger industrial M&A. Thanks.", "Greg Hayes", "", "Yes, I think on the BIS revenue synergies, obviously really the business has been together exactly a year here as of September 30th. And we highlighted, we had this project in Australia that would be bringing in some fire and security products, some CCS product. Last quarter, we talked about project in Hong Kong, we were able to bring Otis elevator contract. In the Middle East, we\u2019ve seen some good pull through where the legacy carrier business has a very good relationship in the Middle East, were able to bring in some the Otis elevators and win some relatively larger awards.", "But these are all kind of one-off today. I think the whole focus here of managing this as a BIS organization is to make that more routine as opposed to one-off. And I think that will take some time, we\u2019re certainly getting some market acceptance today. And as we talk to developers, we\u2019ve talked to the building owners; they see the benefit of BIS versus the individual businesses going to market. So, we\u2019ve got a key accounts leader in place today for the U.S. we\u2019re working that internationally.", "So again, there is momentum building here. I think when Geraud stands up in March next year; he can share some more of the wins with you then.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Are you looking at something like combined capture rates or buying bid rates, I mean is that the way you\u2019re internally looking at the metrics?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, the metric, I actually have seen the exact business review tomorrow with BIS. I\u2019m going to actually see the new metrics that we -- and obviously we\u2019re looking at this more holistically as opposed to just order rates at Otis or order rates at fire and security or carrier. Again, we\u2019re trying to protect this from a top down level with the customer. So I\u2019m going to actually see what the new metric is going to be, we can come back to you with that.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "M&A, the hunt for the big fish.", "Greg Hayes", "We\u2019re still fishing. Like I said, I think back a couple of months ago; the pipeline is not terribly robust. There are opportunities out there obviously on the commercial side. We\u2019re focused on building out the building side and the system side; continue to look for opportunities there. But the market has been tough. As you know equities have grown up quite a bit. Prices are very difficult. And even with the recent price correction if you will, we haven\u2019t seen M&A prices correct along with the rest of the equity market.", "So we\u2019re going be disciplined. We\u2019re going to be patient; we\u2019re going to look for properties in the core. Obviously the focus is on the commercial side, not to say we wouldn\u2019t do an aero deal if one came along. But the pipeline is not terribly full, but we continue to spend a lot of time looking at various opportunities.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks.", "Jay Malave", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next quarter comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Yes. A couple of quick questions Greg. Pension income I assume was about $0.09 a share this quarter $125 million or so?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, it sounds about right.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "And then I want to follow-up a little bit with Pratt because if Pratt cuts like maybe $50 million of the pension income, you still had profits at Pratt up 20 plus million year-over-year despite R&D up $50 million and spares up $7 million, I mean that obviously offset some of it. But it still seems like there had to be some strong performance elsewhere to get the number as good as it was. So I just wonder if you could provide a little bit of color, I mean D2500 engine deliveries are probably a little higher this year than last year so?", "Greg Hayes", "George, we saw a nice growth in Canada, I mean that was up low double-digits both in OE, as well as the aftermarket, so against and also strong with the spare parts business. So Canada contributed, as we saw as I said, we also had strong performance under our contracts and we saw a benefit there in the range of about couple of pennies and so those contributed. And again, as we talked about, we think it\u2019s -- we cannot see some benefit from cost reduction and restructuring.", "So all that taken together, this helps really offset that higher E&D in the quarter, as well as margin pressure. The OE business was up a little bit and the large commercial business, but really not a significant factor.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "And Jay you said that spares were up combined 7%, Pratt Canada and large Pratt was it about equal or both?", "Jay Malave", "That was the total aftermarket was up 7% not just the spares, but on a sales basis, Pratt\u2019s the large commercial spares were pretty much flat and the spares at Canada were up high-teens.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. Okay, thanks a lot.", "Greg Hayes", "Hey George, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning Doug.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Greg on Otis China, you talked about services and that\u2019s clearly long-term the target here, but as services grow, how should we think about margins on that given that in the early couple of years these elevators are under warranty and you don\u2019t have the scale you have in Europe or in the U.S.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, I think Doug, you hit on a key issue with service. Today the margins on service are not much higher than what they are on the OE side, although they\u2019re still very good. The opportunity obviously long-term as you get root density across China as we build out all of these branch offices and add all these service technicians, margins should continue to improve. It\u2019s not clear we\u2019ll ever get to develop country type margins and service, but there is still opportunity here.", "Again I think the idea here today is to focus more on getting the contracts and servicing the customers as opposed to margin expansion. That will come naturally over time as we get more productivity from the sales for the field force. Keep in mind; we\u2019re adding 1,000 people a year to the service network in China. And we\u2019ve got to bring them in, we\u2019ve got to train them, we\u2019ve got to teach them how to service elevators and we\u2019ve got deploy them out to the field, all that is holding down margins in the near-term. But again still a profitable business in China, still good margins, just not the kind of margins that we would expect long-term.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "And then on Pratt, when you look at 2015 and clearly for the geared turbofan, the A320neo is the really big deal here. But when you look at the CSeries, how are you looking at in 2015, what are you looking at in terms of the trajectory of deliveries? And if that were to get delayed, is that something that would have any kind of a material impact on your either revenues or margins at Pratt?", "Greg Hayes", "In fact, we\u2019re delivering some engines this year; I think we\u2019ll probably deliver the same number of engines roughly, maybe a few more next year. So, it\u2019s not a big driver of year-over-year margin degradation at Pratt. And again, we had some recent wins, we feel pretty good about it, the planes up and flying again. And they should be on track to get this thing in service by the end of next year. The bigger ramp will obviously come on the Airbus A320neo. Again there will be huge volumes by 2017 where we could be delivering 500 plus engines a year from zero today.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "So the CSeries itself, you\u2019re not -- that\u2019s probably not -- the timing on that is probably not much of an issue for next year?", "Greg Hayes", "We don\u2019t see it as a big year-over-year driver as we sit here today.", "Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks Doug.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.", "Peter Arment - Sterne Agee", "Yes. Good morning Greg, Jay.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "Peter Arment - Sterne Agee", "Just a quick one regarding update on the synergies, you mentioned back to Howard\u2019s question. The Goodrich synergy, if you remind us where they\u2019re tracking to is in the number still I think $500 million that you had previously indicated and also if you could also give us an update on CCS synergies too?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. So if you think about the synergies, I think through last year we\u2019d recognized about $270 million or so, synergies is another $100 million plus this year. We\u2019re on track probably next year to deliver close to another $100 million of synergies. And I\u2019m sure there are more synergies beyond the $500 million, but again I think talking about synergies versus typical normal cost reduction and other restructuring activities, it\u2019s very difficult as we get passed about the third or fourth year of the acquisition. So we\u2019ll talk about it this year, and we\u2019ll give -- we\u2019ll talk about the tailwind next year. And I think again, we\u2019ll hit that $500 million by the end of next year and then we are just going to keep going and continue to drive margins up. You can call it synergies, you can call cost reduction, you can call it just what we do at UTC, but we\u2019re going to continue to drive margins up beyond that what\u2019s the benefit we\u2019re going to get from the $500 million of synergies.", "In terms of the BIS synergy, we talked about $300 million number, not a big number this year, maybe $50 million of savings between what we\u2019re seeing in the segments. And again, the part of the issue where we still keep Otis and CCS separate from a reporting standpoint, so when we close a CCS office that restructuring savings may show up there, if we close an Otis office, it shows up in that segment. But again that will accelerate in the coming years as we continue with the consolidation process.", "Peter Arment - Sterne Agee", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Greg.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. Thanks everyone for listening today. We look forward to seeing you at our Annual Investor and Analyst meeting on December 11th in New York where Louis will give guidance, complete guidance for 2015. The IR team will be around throughout the rest of the day to take your questions. So thank you very much and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Paul Lundstrom [ph], Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.", "Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations, except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items, as they usually do. ", "The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay. Thank you and good evening everyone. I appreciate everyone\u2019s flexibility in accommodating our changed schedule tonight for the snow storm which is quickly coming upon us.", "Let me start out and talk just briefly about 2014. Then I am going to hand it to Akhil but as you can see from the press release that went out earlier this evening 2014 is largely in line with the expectations we laid out last month at our investor event in New York. Before we get to the results so I would like to take a minute and introduce or reintroduce Akhil Johri, our new CFO. Akhil has been on the job for a few weeks now but you will recall he is a 26 year veteran of United Technologies, recently out of sabbatical as CFO of our Pall Corporation. He knows the business as well, he is highly respected, both within UTC and externally. Needless to say we are excited to have him back on the team. ", "Akhil and Paul will take you through the results and I will come back with some thoughts on the year and 2015 before we get into the Q&A.", "Akhil, you have the floor.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Greg. It\u2019s a pleasure to be back. UTC reported 2014 earnings per share of $6.82, up 10% versus the past year and up 12% excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. Sales of $65 billion included 4% organic growth with all five segments growing organically for the year. Segment operating margins expanded by 90 basis points to 16.6%, reflecting the benefit of volume leverage and cost control at CCS, along with lower pension expense, synergies and restructuring benefits at Pratt and UTC Aerospace Systems.", "Free cash flow to net income was 90% for the year as we had indicated in December and we completed $1.5 billion of share repurchase. ", "Moving on to slide two, top line growth continues. Organic sales were up 4% in the fourth quarter. Recall that Q4 of 2013 was our most difficult compare, so we feel really good about 4% organic as we exit 2014. In the commercial businesses we saw 8% growth in the Americas as the U.S. economic recovery continues. While Europe was up slightly Asia grew 7% but continued growth in China, their sales were up 10%. Growth in commercial Aero OE was offset by lower commercial aftermarket sales at Pratt and Sikorsky. ", "Military Aerospace was up 7% led by the timing of OEM deliveries at both Sikorsky and Pratt, partially offset by a weaker aftermarket across the segments. ", "Taking closer look at our end markets on slide three, and just as a reminder, we will talk to the commercial business orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So overall trends remain consistent with our expectations throughout the portfolio. In our commercial businesses we continue to see good traction in North America. U.S. consumer sentiment reached its highest level in nearly eight years in December on lower gas prices and better wage and job prospects. ADI trends remain positive and the outlook for commercial construction continues to be encouraging. And this is evident at Otis where North America new equipment orders were up 20% and 40% for the year. ", "At CCS, orders for U.S. fire and security and U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was strong, up 18% and 12% respectively. U.S. residential HVAC orders were down slightly year-over-year following a very strong Q3 while sales were up 9%. Europe was soft again in the quarter, with commercial HVAC orders down 9% and Otis new equipment orders down 3%. As you saw on Thursday the ECB announced a significant new quantitative easing program aimed stimulating economic activity in the region. ", "In China, Otis new equipment orders were up 2% in the fourth quarter and finished up 6% for the full year. New equipment backlog remains strong, up 13% versus the prior year. While we expect overall economic output in China to moderate it should still outpace global GDP and our building and industrial systems businesses continue to be well positioned in the region. As a reminder however China domestic sales represent just about 6% of total UTC sales. ", "Moving to Aerospace, revenue passenger miles continue to grow at slightly above the long-term trend rate. And airline profitability remains strong. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%, driven by continuing strength in spares. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were down 6% in the quarter on a tough prior year compare and in-line with our expectations. ", "Taking a look at fourth quarter earnings on slide four, total reported sales increased 1% as 4% organic growth was partially offset by three points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Segment operating profit was up 10% and operating margins increased by 120 basis points, including the benefits from pension. And we saw profit growth and margin expansion in all segments during the quarter. Earnings per share of $1.62 were up 3% and included a $0.26 net charge from restructuring and other one-time items. That\u2019s about $0.24 related to the German tax matter that Greg discussed last month and $0.09 of restructuring that was partially offset by $0.07 of one-time gains in the quarter. ", "Recall that the fourth quarter of 2013 had $0.09 of net restructuring charges. Absent the impact of these items in both years earnings per share were up 13%. Free cash flow in the quarter was 119% of net income. Capital expenditures were $557 million, as we continued to invest for the ramp up in the commercial aerospace. We acquired $405 million of stock under our share repurchase program and we made nearly $300 million in voluntary pension plan contributions in the quarter. ", "One other item to note in Q4, the impact from sudden significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies created a translation FX-related EPS headwind of about $0.04, entirely wiping out the small benefit we had seen in the first three quarters. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has an even larger impact as we look at 2015. As you can see on slide five, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, not just against the euro but against most of the currencies as well. In fact, at a $1, 10 euro which is a little less than today\u2019s rates we have almost $0.25 of headwind that wasn\u2019t contemplated in the initial EPS guidance that we discussed back in December. ", "The incremental negative sales impact from translation FX is expected to be around $1.5 billion. We also saw a further dip in the global discount rates for pension expense. On our measurement date of December 31, the U.S. discount rate was 3.9%, about 30 basis points lower than expected adding to another $0.06 of EPS headwind, net of slightly better asset returns and $200 million of cash contribution to the U.S. pension plan. So all together $0.30 or so of new non-operational headwind. Based on this we are updating our 2015 sales and earnings expectations as you can see on slide six. ", "As always we remain focused on what we can control. We are now targeting $3 billion of share repurchase at the high end of our prior range. We will take additional cost actions, and at the midpoint of the new range we now have no contingency. Together these actions should offset half of the $0.30 headwind. So we now expect EPS of $6.85 to $7.05 on sales of about $65 billion to $66 billion, down from our previous expectation of $7 to $7.20 EPS on sales of $66 billion to $67 billion. However to make it clear nothing has fundamentally changed in the health of the underlying businesses. ", "Just as we told you in December, strong operating leverage across the business should still allow us to deliver segment earnings growth of $0.57 at the mid-point excluding the impact of foreign exchange and pension head winds in 2015 and with no growth at Pratt. That's 8% growth operationally and we will work to rebuild some contingency as we move throughout the year. With that let me turn it over to Paul to take you through the segment results.", "Paul Adams", "Okay, thanks Akhil. We are now on page seven. Otis sales improved 5% in the quarter at constant currency led by double-digit new equipment growth, noticed most notably in China and the Americas. Service sales were up slightly. Overall foreign exchange translation was a five point headwind to the top line in the quarter. Foreign exchange was also a profit headwind, a full six points. Operationally Otis performance in Q4 was solid with operating profit up 7% at constant currency. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by contributions from higher volume and productivity initiatives, most notably from strong performance in the Americas and in Asia.", "We did see continued pricing pressure in the quarter, both in Europe service and in China. New equipment orders were up 12% in the quarter at constant FX. Asia was up 16% driven by a large order in Singapore, the Thomson Line transit project and we saw low single digit growth in China. New equipment orders continued to be strong in the Americas where orders were again up double-digit and for the second year in a row we closed the year with double-digit increases in new equipment backlog. For the full year operating profit was up 4% or about $100 million at constant currency on 6% higher organic sales. FX translation for the year had a two point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit.", "Turning to page eight, Climate, Controls and Security had good traction in the fourth quarter with 5% organic sales growth. We saw strength in the Americas with residential HVAC and foreign security product businesses both reporting high single-digit growth and commercial HVAC up mid-single digit. Outside of the U.S. EMEA grew low single-digit and Asia was up slightly. Commercial refrigeration was up mid-single-digit, while Transicold was up high single-digit driven by solid growth in container and North America Truck trailer.", "At constant currency profit was up 6% in the quarter, driven by contribution from organic volume growth. FX translation represented three points of headwind in the quarter. Margin was up 50 basis points from prior year to 15.7% continuing the CCS margin expansion momentum. CCS global equipment orders were strong, up 11% in the quarter driven largely by Transicold which saw more than 50% growth. ", "Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up mid-single-digit driven by the Americas. Orders for global fire and security products finished the year strong and were again up high single-digit based on strength in the Americas and global fire and security field orders were up 5% with growth in all geographies, including Europe.", "For the full year operating profit was up 10% at constant currency on 3% organic sales growth achieving record margins of 17% up 130 basis points from prior year. As Akhil mentioned we do see significant headwind from foreign exchange, both at CCS and at Otis. Geraud [ph] will come back in March to talk about specific guidance for those two units.", "Moving to Pratt & Whitney on slide nine, Pratt delivered solid results in Q4 with 12% operating profit growth despite continued investment in E&D and a 2% sales decline. In the quarter 4% in military engines was more than offset by a 6% lower commercial aftermarket. Recall that in Q4, 2013 the commercial aftermarket business was particularly strong, up 24%. Operating profit growth was driven by favorable pension and restructuring benefits. The quarter also benefited from better aftermarket contract performance, which helped offset lower aftermarket volume in the quarter. ", "Margins were up 170 basis points to 13.8%. For the year Pratt delivered organic sales growth up 2% driven by mid-single-digit growth in the commercial aftermarket. Incremental investments in E&D were more than offset by a tailwind from pension restructuring savings and a stronger aftermarket, both from higher volume and better contract performance. These led to operating profit growth of $200 million for Pratt with the 140 basis points of margin expansion. This is at the high end of the original guide. ", "Turning to slide 10, UTC Aerospace Systems continued its strong momentum growing profit 17% on 5% higher organic sales in the quarter. Commercial OEM sales were up 7% and commercial aftermarket sales increased 5% with strong growth in spares even on a difficult compare. Similar to Pratt the commercial aftermarket had a very strong finish to 2013 which led to difficult Q4 comparison. Military sales continued to be soft with the military OEM essentially flat and a low-single digit decline in the aftermarket. Profit growth was driven by strong conversion on the incremental volume, integration synergies and the benefit of lower pension expense. ", "Operating margins increased 180 basis points to 17.6%. For the full year sales were up 7% and operating profit was up $327 million or 15% resulting in 130 basis points of margin expansion in-line with our original expectations. The strong full year organic growth of 6% reflects the UTC Aerospace Systems' position in a large and growing commercial aerospace segment. The earnings growth and margin expansion followed the continued successful integration of Goodrich which is now yielding run rate savings of $400 million with line-of-sight visibility to $500 million. ", "Turning to Sikorsky on page 11, operating profit increased 38% on 10% higher sales. Sikorsky shipped a total of 72 aircraft in the quarter, including 57 military platforms and 15 commercial. Overall aircraft shipments were down five compared to the prior year but aircraft completion volume, that's the aircraft customization that occurs following base line aircraft delivery, those completions were up significantly driven primarily by international military programs. We also saw growth in our development programs as a number of recently awarded programs, including the U.S. Presidential helicopter have begun their development ramp. ", "The operating profit increase was driven by the impact of higher international military volume, better mix on commercial OE volumes and favorable contract adjustments partially offset by the drop through from lower commercial aftermarket volume and unfavorable mix in the military aftermarket. For the year, strong international military and commercial OEM sales coupled with the ramp of funded development programs drove sales 6% higher at Sikorsky. Adjusted for restructuring and special items operating profit of $699 million was up 9%. ", "With that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap up. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay, thanks Paul. So all-in-all pretty good year for UTC. As you think about the business it has delivered solid margin expansion to 16.6% and we grew EPS 10%, despite a slower than expected global economic environment. Beyond the financial results we also continue to achieve significant milestones on development programs and to secure key wins for the future. With the Goodrich integration now largely complete we recently announced the elimination of the propulsion and aerospace systems' organization. Pratt and Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems will continue as standalone business units but now reporting directly to me. ", "This new streamlined structure better positions us to serve customers and to focus on ensuring a successful entry into service and production ramp up of our Geared Turbofan engine and the numerous aircraft systems designed and developed by the UTAS team. At Pratt and Whitney the GTF engine completed FAA certification for the Airbus A-320 Neo platform on December 19th. The certification marks a key milestone for the engine and the A-320 Neo program, which remains on schedule to enter into service in the fourth quarter of this year. And we continue to make good progress on the more than 35 new system programs underway at UTC aerospace systems. In 2014 we achieved major milestones, including the entry into service on the Boeing 787-9 and the certification of the A-350. ", "At Sikorsky, another major win in the quarter. India's Navy selected Sikorsky to fulfill the services maritime helicopter requirement and negotiations are currently underway with the Indian Navy to procure 16 S-70B Sea Hawk helicopters with an option for eight additional aircraft along with the complete logistics support and training program. This represents a major step forward for Sikorsky in an important growth market and positions the business well for future opportunities there. ", "The Building and Industrial Systems businesses had another solid quarter with both OTIS and CCS delivering 5% organic sales growth. We feel really good about the progress we've seen in both segments. CCS organic growth has accelerated while delivering 290 basis points of margin expansion since 2012 and OTIS profits are growing again after a couple of very difficult years. ", "So good momentum across the board, that's going to allow us to deliver solid organic growth in 2015. The growth rate exiting the year gives us confidence in our sales assumption of 3% to 5% organic growth in 2015 and we expect continued recovery in our North American markets, slight growth in Europe and moderated but still solid growth in China and Asia. ", "As Akhil mentioned we do have two headwinds this year that worsened since we spoke in December. And as much as I like to I can't control the FX or the discount rates Akhil hasn't figured out how to help me with that yet. As usual we'll do as much as we can to mitigate these headwinds and that includes leaning out the corporate structure and additional share buyback. ", "Lastly we continue to make progress with our portfolio review and as I promised we'll discuss this in more detail over the coming two months. With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. ", "Doug Harned", "Good afternoon.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hey, Doug. ", "Doug Harned", "When you described the changes in guidance for the year, can you walk through how that rolls out across the four different businesses compared to what you talked about in December?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure, Doug. I think for a more precise discussion we'll wait for the President to stand up and talk to you in March, but conceptually you know where this falls, right. The FX headwind is largely going to be in the BIS, space more heavily towards OTIS, which has 80% of its sales internationally and the pension headwind is going to be more in the aerospace space where it will be 40% or so at Pratt and the rest around UTAS and a little bit on the commercial side. ", "The good news $0.15 which offsets half of that $0.30 headwind is going to be spread across on the cost reduction side, across all the businesses a little bit and at the corporate office as well. While the share count reduction benefit will be more at the corporate office as you\u2019ll see a lower share count number. ", "Doug Harned", "And if you look at the operational improvement part of this, so you're looking for -- and I am not sure how much of that $0.15 is operational improvements, but could you describe the kinds of actions you're taking that perhaps you hadn't thought about back in December. You might have thought about but weren't signing up for yet?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think obviously some of the announcements that have gone out over the last couple weeks were all part and parcel to this trend to lean the corporate organizations as well as lean out some of the structures that we have on the aerospace side, specifically at the aerospace systems group. You'll recall Doug at aerospace systems we had two guys running the business, Dave Gitlin and Mike Dumais. We've consolidated all of that under Mike. He\u2019ll be consolidating all the functional responsibilities over the coming weeks as well. So we'll be taking out a significant amount of cost as we go through that. And obviously eliminating Alain\u2019s organization takes a lot across out at the corporate level, some of which got allocated down to Pratt and UTAS. ", "So all of this really focused on leaning out the corporate and the overhead organization.", "Doug Harned", "But does that mean that most of this benefit is occurring on the aerospace side, as opposed to the BIS side?", "Akhil Johri", "BIS has already been working on that, as you know over the last two sort of integrations that you will, first fire and security into carrier and then now OTIS with CCS. There has been a significant reduction in the overhead and the management structures at those companies. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, if you think about it Doug, Geraud has done the commercial side what we're just doing now on the aero side, like we've taken out over 100 executives first when we put fire and security in to Carrier, put that together under CCS and then as we put the OTIS business under the BIS banner again, more and more executives. And so Geraud has already leaned out the overhead structure in those businesses and that's why you see the margins where you do for BIS, why you see that very, very strong margins, a lot of that is just cost reduction.", "Doug Harned", "Okay great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Joseph Nadol", "Thanks, good afternoon. Welcome back Akhil.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks Joe.", "Joseph Nadol ", "Actually just want to continue down that line there, on the PAS elimination, I guess of that structure. Greg a couple of years ago when this was -- this organization was -- stood [ph] up, I thought it was advertised as a cost saving measure and now it\u2019s being advertised again as a cost saving measure when it goes away. I am just wondering if you could explain a little more philosophically which is it? And then you mentioned BIS as well. I am wondering if there is any larger scale changes that we might -- that might be possible on these lines in that organization as well?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, let\u2019s talk about PAS. I mean origin is, this is only about a couple of years when we put Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand together. This is July of 2012, the idea was we put PAS in to oversee the integration of those businesses and to drive the $500 million of synergy benefit that we were expecting on the acquisition. And I would tell you for the most part that is complete. We have got about $400 million of the $500 million done, we have got line of sight to the next $500 million and more beyond that. So I think Alain and that whole team did exactly what we asked them to do in terms of driving cost reduction across. Not -- and it wasn\u2019t really just the aerospace system, we also did significant cost reduction at Pratt, again leaning out the structure of Pratt to taking about a 20% reduction in the overheads at Pratt and Whitney over the last couple of years. ", "So they did exactly what we asked them to do, but again time changes things and today with that mission largely complete I thought it was best to have Paul from Pratt and to have Mr. Gitlin report directly to me. It also gave me the opportunity to take a guy like Mike Dumais who did a wonderful job running his half of the aerospace systems and bring him into the corporate strategy group and let him help me with this portfolio analysis. So this is a win-win ", "I think again leaner organization, more focused, I get more line to sight to what\u2019s going on in the business and the businesses get less overhead cost to worry about. As far as BIS book again I would just go back to what I just said. I think Geraud has been doing what we are doing on the aerospace side for the last three years there, they started in 2011 where he put F&S into Carrier again significant overhead reductions. ", "The whole idea here is again not to have a lot of overhead. We don\u2019t need that. We want to decentralize the organization, we want decision making close to the customer and not at the corporate center. And my job is not to tell these guys how to run the business. These guys know the customer. Each one of the guys at OTIS, at Carrier, at Fire and Security they are out there on the front line still. They just don\u2019t have that same overhead structure above them and I think Geraud would tell he has got line of sight to lot more clearly as to what\u2019s going on in the business as a result of what he has already done.", "Joseph Nadol ", "Okay. And second question, a major event this year is the ramp up of more work on GTF and you mentioned you got certified on Airbus. Can you, I guess speak about the industrial part of the ramp up that\u2019s happening this year and maybe give some context as to when you really feel like you can say we\u2019re heading where we should be on the learning curve from a manufacturing standpoint? And then secondly from a cash flow standpoint if there is anything we should know about the profile as you ramp up throughout the year. Will that impact the company cash flow?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So Joe let me just put it very simply. We are not going to be done until we are done. But this year we\u2019ll build about 85 engines for the Airbus Neo platform. Next year will be about 220. We will double again in 2017. And so again every time we double the engine production we are coming down a learning curve. I think by the time we get to about the 250th engine which is towards the middle of next year we\u2019ll be pretty close -- we will be closing in on target cost not quite there. By the time we exit \u201817 I think we\u2019ll be at or should be at target cost or somewhere close to that. ", "So lot of work to do between here and there. As I said we\u2019re going to get additional negative engine margin this year next year and the following year and then the run rate actually levels out because the number of engine levels out and we continue to come down the cost curve. So we just did a whole review of the production readiness level at Pratt over the last week, had some of the best folks around the business to take a look, to make sure we are on track and well it\u2019s not without risk. And there is a lot to do. We got high confidence that the Pratt guys will get around this and we\u2019re going to be able to meet the production needs at Airbus as well as Bombardier as well as at Mitsubishi as well as with Embraer in 2018. I mean a lot of work to do but a good process in place to make sure that we are going to get there at the right cost. ", "Akhil Johri", "Just one minor correction Joe, I think Greg said about 80 plus Neo engines, it\u2019s actually more like 40 something and -- for this year. And then the other point on your cash flow I think there is clearly going to be some stress, as you have seen in our numbers for the last year or two. The Aero ramp-up does add to the CapEx number which has been above depreciation by a significant amount and that the number we watch very carefully. Obviously you know our gold standard is to be 100% of net income as free cash flow and last year \u201914 was not there. We still have some pressure in \u201915 as a result of that but we are going to work very hard to take out some other things like focusing on inventory and working capital to try and manage some of the CapEx requirements, that exist in the business from the Aero ramp up.", "Joseph Nadol", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Joe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague", "Thank you. Good afternoon everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague", "Hi. Just on the cost side, Greg or Akhil but thinking about raw materials cost, you didn\u2019t address that at all and I was thinking in parts of your business, you could getting some substantial relief. So maybe any color there and you know either hedges or something that are kind of delaying potential positive impacts?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, sure Jeff. Probably the biggest item is copper, where you would expect a significant saving there. We do hedge -- we are hedged about 75% of our 2015 requirements at over $3, $3.05, if you will. So there is really limited impact that we will see in the later part with the significant reduction in the copper that has come about lately. But there is definitely going to be benefit on the oil side, the lower fuel cost both for jet fuels that are used by our aerospace companies as well as in the large number of trucks and service vehicles that we had, we should see some benefits there. We estimate maybe $50 million to $75 million of benefit which probably towards the later part in the year help us build a little bit of our contingency back. ", "On the other hand you know customers see the same papers that we do and the same reports that we do and there is likely to be probably a little more pressure on the pricing side because they will expect some of this to be passed through to them. So we have got to balance both those things which is why we have not reflected that potential savings in our roadmap that you saw on page six.", "Jeff Sprague", "On the other key notes steel and aluminum you are maybe not hedged per se but are you kind of indexed some contractual lock in there that you don\u2019t get any significant immediate benefit also?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, there is actually a little bit of headwind aluminum right now. Iron ores and steel prices have come down but we don\u2019t really have a lot of hedges out there. So we will see a little bit of benefit on steel, a little bit of headwind at aluminum which should pretty well offset each other I would think for the year.", "Jeff Sprague", "No, I was just wondering, just back to where the prior question ended, kind of on cash flow and CapEx. Now looks like you actually throttled the CapEx back pretty hard relative to the annual expectation here. Can we go down from this 1.7 level in 2015 and how do we think about working capital in 2015?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think that we have been looking at about $2 billion number for CapEx going into the last year. I think the folks on the businesses to do a pretty good job of reducing that and trying to move some of that out, obviously puts a little bit of pressure on the 1.7 number that we have got this year but we are not done. I think again the CapEx investments will be what it needs to be. I think the bigger opportunity as I think about cash well it goes back to working capital and it goes back to inventory. We have got almost $10 billion of inventory out there. The churns are not spectacular and the focus has to be on improving churns and it\u2019s batten [ph] our factories. I would tell you our factories are world class. When they get the inventory they can move it very quickly through the assembly and test process. ", "The issue is in the supply base where we don\u2019t have suppliers that all deliver 100% on time with a 100% perfect quality. As a result we have a lot of buffer inventory at every level of the production process. So as -- one of the other benefits of eliminating the past structure, the operations is now going to report directly to me and we have got a team under Beno\u00eet Brossoit who has very been focused on supplier process improvement and we are going to go after this inventory reduction, at its root cause which I would tell you is supplier performance. If we get our suppliers at the same level of delivery and quality as our own factories we can reduce inventory by a significant amount. And it\u2019s not at this year and next year, the next several years. But we're going to work at it. And I think that will help us get back to that 100% of free cash flow net income despite where there is a little bit of elevated CapEx investment this year. ", "Jeff Sprague", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good afternoon. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hey Sam.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Some of the additional cost reductions that you have talked about, does it change the plan in terms of the $300 million worth of restructuring, offset by $300 million in gains. Does that dynamic change at all during the year?", "Akhil Johri", "No, Sam. We don't think so. We still think restructuring will be about $300 million for the year and probably ratably across the quarters, $75 million each quarter if you will. ", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay, and then in total what is your assumption about Europe right now? I know Greg said slight growth, but is it different than it was in December and it's just -- is it same and it's just a translation issue, or have you assumed a slower growth at this point?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well, despite the Greek elections on Sunday I think generally we think Europe will be probably a little bit better, with the quantitative easing that Mr. Dragi has initiated on top of the much lower fuel prices, gas and oil. There is a natural stimulus that we ought to see in Europe this year that we didn't really see six weeks ago, when we talked about it, so. We say up slightly. It could be better. I mean we have pockets of bursts [ph] that was very good last year and the fire product side in Europe was very good. The service side, not as good. I think overall I think we'll get better -- Europe will get better this year than what we had expected. So that maybe a little bit of upside. ", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay, and then last question. The CR-13 and you just talked about inventory. Was there any sort of build in terms of the last of the manufacturing what you could do this year and does that all go back out in 2015. Can you size that at all? ", "Akhil Johri", "Yeah no, I think Greg mentioned this at the last call or the last meeting, about a $150 million worth of inventory build-up associated with CR-13. As you know the regulations would say that we cannot produce anymore CR-13 in 2015. So all that inventory was in our balance -- was on our balance sheet at the end of December and will be sold through the early part of this year we expect. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah I think that's just for the -- those parts of the country that can\u2019t -- we can't sell CR-13. ", "Akhil Johri", "Right, exactly.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So, but yeah it\u2019s not significant. I think again we'll put a play out here in the first four or five months of the year and we'll go back to normal. ", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Sam. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open. ", "Carter Copeland", "Hey good evening guys. And welcome back Akhil. ", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks Carter. ", "Carter Copeland", "Just a couple of end market kind of color questions for you. The first on the military softness, you called out at UTAS, any color you can give us on where you saw that and I know the expectations around military have been kind of -- we've been kind of little short in both last year and some of the recent quarters. Can you give us some color on where that came from?", "Akhil Johri", "Not a huge deal of impact frankly. I think both OEM and the aftermarket and military side for UTAS was down low-single digit. So it's really not -- nothing dramatic, nothing out of the ordinary. As we look ahead at next year Carter, I think the feeling is that the aftermarket might be actually slightly better, maybe up low-single digit for UTAS, while the OEM side will probably be down low-single digit. So I think in balance we still feel it's kind of at treading water, if you will, nothing either positive or negative to talk about it. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, in Q4 OEM was essentially flat, military aftermarket was down a little bit. ", "Carter Copeland", "Okay, and with respect to Sikorsky if you were to give us a kind of real-time assessment on how things look there on the commercial Hi-Lo side, given obviously the anticipated weakness in oil and gas. And what the expectation is there for spares and what are you seeing and any color there would be helpful? ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "And maybe just I\u2019ll give you a high level, Akhil can tell you the right numbers. But essentially we're seeing some softness on the S-92 deliveries, as you would expect, like we got about 40 this year, we had expected to deliver. There is a little bit of pressure there, some of the exploration companies are scaling back. I just mentioned though, the 80, more than 80% of the use of the helicopters for offshore oil is for current production, It's not for exploration. So you're talking on the margin, yeah, there maybe a few aircraft that will be little bit more difficult to sell. But Mick and team I think are on top of it down there. ", "Aftermarket\u2019s been little slower on the commercial side than we expected. Part of that's because the reliability of the S-92 has been so good. And the other part I think is just cash conservation by some of the operators. ", "Akhil Johri", "Yeah, no, there are some, as you would imagine a little bit of concern about the oil and gas related Hi-Lo market, as you said. But I know Mick and team are committed to delivering on their plan and they are not going to let small things like this come in the way. ", "Carter Copeland", "Great, thanks guys. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Carter. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you. Just a question on the balance sheet. I guess one of the advantages of having a very large balance sheet is that you can use it to offset surprise headwinds. And I guess, if I just pro forma that $0.15 of tailwind or offset in to the three buckets, buyback is $0.05 of that. So I just wanted to check what the urgency to use the balance sheet this year to drive earnings is?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I don\u2019t think there is any urgency other than the fact that we\u2019re not going to sit still and just take and let these cost headwinds tank the year. I think again we\u2019re doing what we can to offset those. And the $3 billion we talked about that back in December we said $2 billion to $3 billion, I would tell you was range [ph] remaining low, without, I would say a very robust M&A pipeline, I guess is pretty easy to commit to the $3 billion today. And again I wouldn\u2019t suggest that there is a big use of our balance sheet. We got a $92 billion balance sheet. Obviously we have a room to do a lot more than an additional $1 billion if we wanted to. ", "We\u2019re not going to commit to anything more than the $3 billion today but it remains an option, if again share price remains low and the acquisition pipeline doesn\u2019t show up. ", "Akhil Johri", "The key thing that, Julian just to keep in mind as Greg laid out very clearly we are interested in M&A. We would like to do some transactions. The valuations sort of prevent us from going too far out on that today. Greg very clearly laid out the criteria that we look at M&A transactions with IRR or double-digit accretive in year two and neutral to ROIC for UTC overall by year four. Those are tough criteria in today\u2019s market but at the same time we want to keep our flexibility and keep our balance sheet optionality available and not go much higher on share buyback till we completely conclude on the M&A environment. ", "Julian Mitchell", "Understood, thanks and then just on commercial aero aftermarket, as you said the trends in Pratt and UTAS on sales were both sort of lower than the high single-digit growth guidance for 2015. So how quickly do you think you\u2019ll snap back to that high single-digit trend? Is it something you could see at the beginning of the year and any impact you\u2019re seeing on airline behavior on aftermarket from oil?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, at this point I don\u2019t think the trends were any different than what we expected. Remember Q4 last year was extremely strong. Pratt spares, if I remember correctly, were up 24% and the UTAS spares were up significantly as well. So on that -- on 17% Paul tells me. So on top of those strong numbers UTAS grew 5% and Pratt was down 6% or 5%. So given that it\u2019s really not a change in our expectations. We still expect mid-single digit type of growth at Pratt and high single-digit growth in the aftermarket at UTAS. So I wouldn\u2019t call it a changing trend. ", "With regard to customer behavior, obviously the expectation is that certainly on the Pratt side with the airline profitability being what it is, we would hope for a little more content per visit when the engines actually come back and perhaps a little bit more provisioning and inventory build-up at the airlines and that should help us a little bit but it\u2019s too early to call that. ", "Julian Mitchell", "Right, thank you. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Julian. ", "Operator", "Next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. ", "Cai Von Rumohr ", "Yes, thank you and let me join in welcoming you coming you back, Akhil. So commercial aftermarket, could you give us what the orders were in the fourth quarter for Pratt and UTAS? How much you think that might have been impacted by price hike and are you seeing anything in terms of impact from lower fuel prices yet?", "Akhil Johri", "The answer to your last question, not much yet on the Pratt side. The spares orders were down about 8% or so for the quarter and that is again no surprises there. Within that however I\u2019d remind you that V2500s were actually up mid-single digit and decline was in what has been a secular issue for us which is the legacy engines, the PW2000 and PW4000 where retirements are hurting and the surplus parts market is hurting our space business a little bit. So no change there. The trends continued to be where they are. As I said earlier we do expect some benefit from the oil price reduction. But it's not yet showing in our number and maybe at some point we'll get some benefit there. ", "On the UTAS side again the spares were -- orders were up year-over-year, probably a little lower than what the sales were up. So I think we are still on track there for the high single-digit growth.", "Cai Von Rumohr ", "Thank you and you mentioned that OTIS\u2019 orders in China were up 2%. As you are probably aware of the decline, the monthly decline in residential home prices has kind of been accelerating through December. What are you seeing in terms of tone? You talked, I think in December of looking for 10% growth in constant currency in new elevator sales at OTIS in China. Is that still realistic?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, Cai. It's certainly within the realm of possibility. If you think about it, backlog at OTIS will end the year up about 13% year-over-year and we will convert probably 60% or 70% of that into sales. So as we start the year in a flat market you would expect kind of 7% or 8% kind of growth in OTIS China. We'll see. Again there is obviously pressure on home prices. We continue to see that, which is really held orders down for the years, especially the back half of the year.", "But again I think there is a pathway towards double-digit, if we see any recovery. We're seeing some stimulus measures take hold, seeing some bank lending regulations ease a little bit to try and again reinvigorate the property markets. So I wouldn't give up on this. I think there is still opportunity there but again just given the strong backlog when we end the year, I feel pretty optimistic we're going to continue see growth in China.", "Cai Von Rumohr ", "Thanks, so much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much. Greg, I want to kind of be a little bit high level. There is sort of two things. One is restructuring and the second is capital spending. How do you think about the two of those as you put them together to improve the profitability of the various business units?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Well the margin expansion, cost reduction is part of the DNA of UTC and that's not going to change, I don\u2019t care who is sitting in my chair. That\u2019s just the way we do business and the businesses are always focused on down taking cost out. And so I think as we go into the year with this $300 million placeholder we've got plenty of opportunities to do cost reduction and probably more opportunities then there is funding as we start the year. But again we always find ways to fund the really good ideas. ", "So we are going to continue on this path of cost reduction. That\u2019s just the way we do business here. As far as CapEx we have been, I would say overconsuming here, but again it's all part of this, I call the reseeding of the commercial engine business with new GTF engines and as a result we're going to have to catch up a little bit of the spending and that's not just Pratt. It's also across the aerospace, we have 50 new aircraft systems going into production here in the next few years, requires a lot of capital. So we're in a secular site [indiscernible]. CapEx is just naturally going to be high, it will come down. But frankly we're not capital constrained. ", "We were going to fund what we need to from a CapEx standpoint, we were going to fund what we need to from a restructuring standpoint because they all have very, very solid returns and we've got a good process internally where all of these capital appropriations as well as restructuring programs they come through Akhil finance organization, they are reviewed, they are validated and I think we're making solid investment decisions whether it's restructuring or CapEx.", "Howard Rubel", "I get it. I mean it's really to drive the returns and improve the performance for competitive position. The follow up, I'm going to talk about maybe CCS for a moment. I mean usually we find fire and security is the one that's more of the challenged business unit and this time I think there are some maybe elements of Carrier, rather a pleasant surprise. Could you talk about, I mean could you talk a little bit about whether it's additional new product, whether it's the market who have become more competitive or what's the other change there? I mean is it all or is it something else I've missed?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "I think you probably hit on it and then some. I think again part of it is Geraud has invested a lot in new products in Carrier on the commercial HVAC side. We're seeing that start to pay off. We are spending more money on the security side, both fire products and electronic security getting new products, driving return of growth. I also think the way we have organized the business again while we think about BIS as the central organization it\u2019s really decentralized decision making out of the field where you have got people that are focused on individual markets, individual countries that are driving decisions, that are helping to drive growth. ", "And again as I think about 2015 while cost reduction will be important the real key to 2015 earnings growth is going to be top line growth and Geraud has a very aggressive plan out there but I think he has got the products and the people and the markets are going in his favor. He can actually see 5% or 6% organic revenue growth this year. And we\u2019ll see where we are at the end of the year, even with tough conditions in Europe and slow in China, still feel very confident we are going to hit those numbers.", "Akhil Johri", "And if you were to ask Geraud, Howard I am sure he will tell you that with the portfolio transformation pretty much behind in the fire and security space there is a lot more focus on looking at the growth opportunities and the growth markets and devoting the time and resources to make that we are capitalizing on those opportunities. So we would fully expect that the growth profile for both fire and security and for the CCS business overall will be better than what you have seen in the past.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Howard.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.", "Jason Gursky", "Great, thank you and good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to the guidance for a moment, in the prepared remarks you suggested that the FX headwind was going to be a $1.5 billion for the year and yet guidance has come down by about $1 billion at the midpoint? Just wondering if you can just provide a little bit more color on that and connect some thoughts?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure, Jason this is Akhil. Yes, the exact math is $1.5 billion on the top line from the change in currencies. We typically don\u2019t like to give guidance in decimal points this early in the year. So whether it\u2019s 64.5% to 65.5% or it\u2019s 65% to 66%, I would say probably in our new range of 65% to 66% it wants to be at the lower end of that range. On the other hand to what Greg said earlier we are hopeful that the organic growth might come in little bit on the higher side of the range that we had before, the 3% to 4%. It maybe towards the higher end as opposed to the lower end of that. So does it end being 65.5 or 65.3, too early to call but it\u2019s -- we left a range in round numbers.", "Jason Gursky", "Okay, great. And then just a quick question on efforts to reduce the buffer inventory, the $10 billion. Can you talk a little bit about the reaction that you have seen thus far from your supply base and whether this will lead to consolidations amongst your supply base, just how they are reacting to it? And then I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in one business or another but maybe where the biggest opportunities might lie?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Enthusiastic support, Jason. We have many really, really good suppliers, large suppliers. So we can\u2019t lump them all together. I think the bigger suppliers tend to be the better suppliers and one of the things that we have been pushing in the supply base is consolidation of some of the second and third tier, because quite frankly they can\u2019t afford to invest in the technologies and the systems the way the larger suppliers are. ", "In terms of where the opportunities are I would tell it\u2019s primarily on the aerospace side. I think again as I go to BIS and think about supply chain at OTIS or supply chain at Carrier or Fire and Security pretty well developed and again a little bit different in terms of technologies but again their suppliers, I think generally have performed better than the suppliers on the aerospace side. I mean part of that is because of all the changes on the aero side but really most of work is going to have to be done in that supply chain on the aero side.", "Akhil Johri", "And if I may, having grown up through some of those businesses, it\u2019s what happens is typically, it\u2019s not so much the issue is inventory driven by the suppliers, it\u2019s because internally nobody wants to hold up the line. So when material planning people are concerned about a supplier performance they end up safety stock and that just builds upon itself. So even if one part is going to be up you end having a lot more inventory in the chain. So as Greg said once we can get all suppliers supplying on time with perfect quality that\u2019s when you will see all that buffer inventory in our system start to disappear and we will get there.", "Jason Gursky", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.", "David Strauss", "Good afternoon.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hey David.", "David Strauss", "OTIS, North America new equipment orders have been really strong for about two years now. Greg can you just talk on, maybe give some color exactly what's going on there, what do you guys see as kind of market rate of growth and how much share you might be picking up there and what do you really think is driving this outsized kind of growth that we're seeing?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It's a couple of factors David. Obviously OTIS is the ubiquitous brand here in the U.S. and we have been gaining share back. But it is also a market that's recovering although some very low numbers and we're still not even back to the 2007 level. So while the recovery feels really good we still have ways to go on it. I think OTIS has done a great job on the products side and as well as the cost side to deliver much better value to the customers and the customers value that. The ABI has been improving, as you see it's been over 50 now for the most of the past year and quite frankly we've also gotten our house in order. You remember the -- some of the message we have in terms of the move from Nogales to Florence, South Carolina, that's behind us. ", "Again we're delivering product on time. It's really good quality. All those things coming together helping OTIS regain the share here in the US and again I think the party is not over. All of the orders that we have been taking it for the last few years are going to come out and sales over the next two years and again I think OTIS North America is going to have a very good couple of years coming up.", "David Strauss", "Greg, can you talk about how far you're still below prior peak levels in North America?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "As I recall 2007 we are about $1.2 billion in new equipment I think we are about $800 million, $900 million maybe this year. So you still got another 25% to go. ", "David Strauss", "Okay, great. Business jet market I think Pratt Canada sales were [indiscernible] were a little bit lower in '14. What are you seeing in that market, we\u2019ve got some players talking about things improving, are you actually seeing any sort of underlying market improvement or is it just new product that shipping grew?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It's more a weakness on the helicopter side of the business of the Pratt Canada engine market if you will, right? And some of the things that we talked about before, the operators have been a little gun shy in terms of taking new deliveries of engines. There is some concern we hear about inventory at the operator\u2019s levels. People who are making those aircraft for the helicopter market. So that's the space. ", "On the business jet side, I think there is no significant change in trends. We still -- the engine shipments were in line with our expectations probably just slightly ahead of the last year but it's primarily the turboprop and the helicopter market where we saw some weakness. ", "David Strauss", "And Greg you mentioned the German tax case I think, at the Investor day, you talked about $400 million of potential cash tax, cash payment, is that still the right number and is that explicitly in the 90% to 100% free cash flow in that end?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "It's in the 90, it's not in 100. So if you want to think about it, 10% of free cash will be about $600 million. So if we have to pay the German tax authorities before we have the case fully adjudicated you're going to see a lot of pressure on that 100 getting closer to 90. So we're thinking about it, we're still working it out, the attorneys still tells us that we're going to win eventually. But we may have to put up the money in the interim. So we'll let you guys know. ", "Akhil Johri", "See that's one place where the Euro weakening is actually good news, right?", "David Strauss", "Right, got it. Thanks guys. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Dave. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ", "Nigel Coe", "Yeah, thanks and good evening guys. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hi, Nigel. ", "Nigel Coe", "It\u2019s getting kind of late here So I'll keep this [indiscernible]? ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Got us snowing here. ", "Nigel Coe", "It is kind of snowing. So you obviously you have taken the maximum costs [ph] out which I think it's commendable but did he mention you're going to a 1.10 euro. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, that's correct.", "Nigel Coe", "1.10 euro, okay that's been considered. And then just obviously you mentioned in the second bridge that that\u2019s gets taken within OTIS which makes $0.30 but how does the strong euro, sorry the weak euro, how does that impacts OTIS margins this year?", "Akhil Johri", "The impact that we are talking about is more just from translation. So I don't think that changes anything on an organic basis for the margins there. Within Europe we still have the same operating fundamentals that existed. There is still some pressure on the pricing side in the service business, but there continuous to be improvement as we continue to help improve the total number of units under contract in Europe. That was declining for a while and it's starting to stabilize and move in the right direction. He was very focused on that. But I think there is nothing changing as a result of the currency it's more just the\u2026 ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "As you think about currency it\u2019s simply a translation issue. The fact is we manufacture in most of these locations where we sell. So in terms of real economic impact it\u2019s really muted by the fact that you manufacture be it in China or you manufacture in Europe. So this is just a translation and going against right now. We think 1.10 is the bottom but we'll keep look it.", "Nigel Coe", "Sure and just one more, obviously Europe is mainly a service market. So I was wondering if the translation of that high margin service in Europe this will see overall segment margin?", "Akhil Johri", "Yeah, there is a slight impact Nigel, you're right. but it's not that material. There is some impact absolutely. ", "Nigel Coe", "Okay, that is on the -- I just want to talk to that. And then just switching to, obviously you [indiscernible] structure. Does that imply that you haven't look at the BIS structure Greg and you're comfortable that, that\u2019s the currency [ph] that you focus. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yeah, look we've talked about this already a little bit on the call. But I think Geraud has already done on the BIS side what we're doing on the Aero side in terms of reducing structure. He's done it over the course of the last couple of years from 2011 through this past year end where we've been taking out executives and taking out structure as we've been consolidated the back office functions as well as the overhead structures of these businesses. So I don't think there is the opportunity exists on the BIS side the same way it did on the PAS side. ", "Nigel Coe", "Okay, thanks guys. ", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay. Well thanks to everyone for the [indiscernible] tonight to change the timing of this. I hope everybody has a safe couple of days here with the coming snowstorm and we look forward to seeing you guys all in March. The IR team will be available for a few minutes tonight and then all day of course tomorrow. So please give us call if you have any questions. Thanks a lot.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Director Investor Relations.", "This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note the Company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.", "The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectation and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions we ask that your limit your first-round to 2 questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay, thank you, and good morning, everyone. As you guys saw in the press release today, UTC reported Q1 earnings per share of $1.58, that is up 20% versus prior year and up 7% excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. Foreign-exchange had an unfavorable impact of $0.07 in the quarter which equates to about 5% on year-over-year earnings. So a good start to the year.", "We also benefited from a few timing items that Akhil and Paul will walk you through in a second. Sales of $14.5 billion were up 3% organically led by solid growth at Climate, Controls & Security and UTC Aerospace Systems, which were up 6% and 7% respectively on an organic basis. Segment operating margins expanded by 20 basis points to 15.6% despite a 40 basis point headwind from pension.", "For the full year, we continue to expect earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.05. With that, let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the results in detail, and I will be back and give you some thoughts on the quarter and the remainder of the year before we get into the Q&A. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Greg. Turning to slide 2, organic sales grew 3% in the quarter and that is on top of the 5% organic growth we saw in the same quarter last year. In the commercial businesses, we saw 6% growth in the Americas helped by the ongoing US economic recovery. Asia also grew by 6%, and Europe was up slightly in the quarter.", "On the aerospace side, defense sales were flattish and commercial grew by 3%, with aftermarket growth of 2% at Pratt and 4% at UTC Aerospace Systems. Sikorsky's commercial business was down 26% as lower oil prices negatively impacted demand for helicopters and aftermarket in the oil and gas segment.", "Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide 3 \u2013 and just a reminder, we will talk to the commercial business orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. Although there are some puts and takes, overall macro trends continue to support our expectation of 3% to 5% organic sales growth for the year.", "In our commercial businesses, we continue to see growth in the US. Despite a harsh winter in many parts of the country, the outlook for commercial construction markets remains encouraging and ABI trends have been positive 10 out of the last 12 months. We continue to see that in our orders at Otis where US new equipment was up 14%.", "At CCS, America\u2019s commercial HVAC equipment orders were up mid-single digit. Residential equipment sales were up 3% in the quarter, and that is on a tough compare. Recall that resi sales were up over 20% in Q1 2014.", "As many of you know, Carrier's US resi business is primarily a book and ship business and starting with this quarter we will include resi equipment sales on this chart with orders for other long lead CCS equipment businesses. This gives a better representation of market demand and removes noise from things like last year's SEER 14 change-related pre-order. We have adjusted the historic data for comparison as well.", "Moving on to Europe, we see the economic environment trending positively as quantitative easing measures take hold and a weaker euro supports export growth. Euro zone manufacturing activity expanded in March to its fastest pace in 10 months driven by Germany, Italy, and Spain in particular.", "At UTC, Otis new equipment orders were up 37% reflecting broad based strength. Commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were also up 10%. In Asia, economic output in China is moderating. As we all know, this is not new news. Real estate investment, new construction starts, floor space sold are all slowing.", "Otis equipment orders were down 12% in the quarter. Now Q1 is our most difficult compare there, but construction activity in China has clearly been slowing.", "Shifting to commercial aerospace, as Dave Gitlin said in March, UTC Aerospace Systems had a soft start to the year in the commercial aftermarket where sales were up 4%. This was driven mainly by a tough prior year compare on provisioning, but parts sales were strong, up 12% in the quarter.", "At Pratt & Whitney, commercial aftermarket sales were up 2% with growth in transactional spares partially offset by lower engine service revenues. In spite of this slow start, we continue to be encouraged by the strong fundamentals of sustained 5% to 6% air-traffic growth and healthy airline profitability projections.", "Taking a closer look at the first-quarter results on slide 4, total reported sales decreased by 1% as 3% organic growth was more than offset by 4 points of headwind from the stronger US dollar. Segment operating profit was flat in the quarter with 5 points of headwind from foreign-exchange.", "Operating margins of 15.6% increased by 20 basis points led by CCS where we saw solid drop through once again leading to margin expansion of 120 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.58 was up 20% in the quarter, driven largely by the timing of restructuring and gains.", "Recall that the first quarter of 2014 included $0.09 of net restructuring charges, while we saw $0.07 of net gains in the first quarter of 2015. Absent the impact of gains and restructuring, earnings per share were up 7%, about $0.10 higher than we anticipated based on earlier than expected finalization of some discrete items at CCS, Pratt, UTAS, and Corporate.", "Free cash flow in the quarter was 67% of net income, driven largely by seasonal inventory build and higher receivables. Free cash flow was also adversely impacted by a significant net outflow in the quarter at Sikorsky.", "Share repurchase was $3 billion, including the benefit from the accelerated stock repurchase that we announced last month, so we are pretty much done with the share buybacks placeholder for this year. We are maintaining our placeholder of $1 million for M&A and continue to expect free cash flow to net income of 90% to 100% in 2015.", "We also continue to anticipate $300 million in restructuring this year, all offset by one-time gains. The recorded pretax equivalent gains of $0.14 in Q1 and expect the remaining $0.09 in the second half. We spent $93 million on restructuring in the first quarter and expect gains to equal restructuring for the first half.", "As we think about first half earnings, we expect organic revenue growth to be in line with the full-year guidance of 3% to 5% and reported EPS growth to be slightly above the high end of the full-year expectation of zero to 3%.", "Let me stop there for now and turn it over to Paul to take you through the business unit results in more detail.", "Paul Lundstrom", "Okay, thanks, Akhil. So turning to page 5, Otis profit improved 1% at constant currency on 2% organic sales growth. Overall foreign-exchange translation was an 11 point earnings headwind and a 9 point sales headwind.", "Profit growth in quarter was driven by contributions from higher volume and productivity initiatives in the Americas and in Asia. This was offset by a decline in profit in Europe due to lower volume and continued pricing pressure in the service business.", "Sales in EMEA were down mid-single-digit with declines in both service and equipment sales. Both the Americas and Asia regions were up 7%. The Americas had nearly 20% new equipment sales growth and low-single-digit service growth while Asia had high single-digit growth in new equipment and mid-single-digit growth in service.", "Sales in China were up 7% driven by the conversion of new equipment backlog and strong service. But that plus 7% was softer than the 10% growth we expected this year.", "New equipment orders were up 8% in the quarter at constant FX and continued to be strong in the Americas where orders were up high-single-digit. Orders in EMEA were very strong, up 37% with broad based growth across the region. Asia orders, however, were down mid-single-digit driven by weaker demand in China which saw a 12% decline on some large projects. On a unit basis orders were essentially flat.", "Q1 was a tough compare for China. Recall that last year orders were up 25% in the first quarter. But as Akhil said, activity clearly has softened. We continue to watch China and Europe service. And for the year, guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $100 million to $150 million of profit growth for Otis.", "On slide 6 Climate, Controls & Security had good traction in the first quarter with 6% organic sales growth led by Transicold, which grew high teens following the strong order intake we saw in Q4 at both container and North America truck trailer. We saw mid-single-digit growth in the Americas led by commercial HVAC and the Fire & Security product businesses.", "EMEA grew low-single-digits while Asia was down low-single-digit with declines in commercial HVAC, most notably in China and in Southeast Asia, partially offset by growth in Fire & Security field.", "Operating profit was up 14% at constant currency driven by drop through on the organic volume growth along with benefits related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a joint venture and a property sale. FX translation was a 6 point profit headwind. Overall operating margins were up 120 basis points from prior year to 16.3%.", "Order growth at CCS was led by double-digit growth in refrigeration on a very strong Transicold, up nearly 25% along with better commercial refrigeration where orders were up mid-single-digit. Global Commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single-digit with strength in the Americas offsetting weakness in Asia. Fire & Security product orders were flattish while field orders declined by the mid-single-digits.", "As Akhil mentioned, CCS equipment orders were up 6%, in line with our full-year mid-single-digit organic sales growth expectation. With solid results in the first quarter for CCS we continue to expect profit growth of $200 million to $250 million on a constant currency basis on mid-single-digit organic sales growth.", "Turning to aerospace on slide 7, Pratt & Whitney sales were flattish organically with military engine sales and commercial aftermarket both up 2%. Just a comment on that 2% up commercial aftermarket, it is a bit misleading as the large commercial engine transactional aftermarket business was up 6% with spares up nearly 10%. This signals healthy airline activity.", "Aftermarket shop visits were down in the quarter which, with our fleet management programs, means engines are on wing longer. That is good for the airlines and good for Pratt over the long-term. Commercial OE was down mid-single-digit driven by the timing of engine shipments. Pratt operating profit was flat. Headwinds from higher negative engine margin and pension expense were more than offset by favorable aftermarket mix and performance along with lower engineering and development spending.", "The quarter also benefited by $0.03 from a favorable contract termination. Margins were up 10 basis points to 13%. For the full year we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney's operating profit to be down $50 million to $125 million.", "Turning to slide 8, UTC Aerospace Systems profits grew 4% on 7% organic sales growth. Sales were driven by double-digit growth in commercial OE and a 4% increase in commercial aftermarket, which were partially offset by a softer military business which was down mid-single-digits.", "Commercial OE sales benefited from a change in arrangement that added around $50 million of pass-through sales with no margins. As Akhil noted earlier, we signaled a slow start to our commercial aftermarket business and we saw that with lower provisioning and maintenance volume in our repair shops. But we continue to be encouraged by strong parts sales which were up 12% in the quarter.", "Year-over-year profit growth was driven by benefits from contract settlements, continued cost reduction efforts and additional licensing income. These were partially offset by higher pension expense and FX. Operating margins were up 10 basis points at actual FX to 17.4%.", "For the year, based on anticipated improvements in the commercial aftermarket, we continue to expect profit growth of $225 million to $275 million on mid-single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.", "Turning to Sikorsky on slide 9, sales were down 7% organically and operating profit decreased by 11%. The year-over-year sales decline was driven by lower commercial volume as well as continued softness in both military and commercial aftermarket.", "We are seeing pressure from the oil and gas segment. Not only has new capacity been put on hold, the number of offshore working rigs has also come down, which puts pressure on fleet expansion and the existing fleet's aftermarket business.", "In the quarter Sikorsky shipped 7 fewer S-92 and S-76D aircraft. Although Q2 should be better, we will likely see continued pressure in the back half of the year. Softer shipments were partially offset by growth in development programs, which were up significantly as we ramp up on both the presidential and the combat rescue helicopter programs.", "The operating profit decline was driven by the impact of lower commercial aircraft volumes and the Canadian maritime helicopter program. Although margin from the higher development sales did provide some offset, development sales come at a lower margin rate than commercial where we saw the largest declines.", "This was a slow start for Sikorsky. It's too early in the year to point to a guidance change, but we are clearly seeing pressure in commercial from steep spending declines in the oil and gas industry.", "During the quarter Sikorsky started ground testing on the first 53K flight aircraft, as well as on the first S-97 RAIDER prototype aircraft and expects first flight of the RAIDER in the second quarter. These are major milestones for 2 key programs. With that let me turn it back to Greg for wrap up.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, Paul. Let me wrap up with just a few thoughts. So a good start to the year with 3% organic revenue growth, solid earnings growth and continued margin expansion. Order trends and end markets are broadly in line with expectations with a few exceptions.", "China is clearly softer for our commercial businesses. However, the stimulus programs which were announced yesterday should help. On the other hand the US slightly better. HVAC is up in the US, Fire & Security products are up, and Otis new equipment orders are up again and have been strong now for quite some time. So the US feels pretty good.", "Although in the past we've been disappointed by a lack of growth in Europe, I'm encouraged by the signs of growth we are now seeing. 6 months ago we wouldn't have thought that Otis new equipment orders would ever be up almost 40% in the region. So, great traction there this quarter.", "On the aero side, a little slower than expected start in the commercial aftermarket, but we continue to expect growth to improve as we move through the year as the benefits of lower oil prices makes its way into the airline purchasing activity and compares get a little easier. And while lower oil prices are putting some near-term pressure on Sikorsky, the benefits from lower oil costs in other segments will provide some offset.", "So as I said, a good start to the year. We continue to achieve significant milestones on our programs, continue to secure key wins and position the portfolio to drive long-term shareowner value.", "At Pratt & Whitney, Geared Turbofan has now completed more than 16,000 hours and 31,000 cycle of full engine testing, including 3,500 hours of flight time. In addition to the A320neo flight testing we are also powering flights on 6 CSeries test aircraft.", "Our new engines are meeting or exceeding technical expectations and customer commitments providing a glimpse of the significant value these engines are expected to deliver to customers following entry into service later this year.", "You recall back in January we consolidated our Aerospace Systems business from a 2 P&L structure into a single P&L. Dave Gitlin and the team have done a good job over the past 3 months of bringing these 2 structures together, while staying focused on supporting our customers and delivering best-in-class margins.", "As you saw a few weeks ago, we welcomed Bob Leduc back to UTC as the President of Sikorsky Aircraft. He started earlier this month and has hit the ground running. Across the aerospace industry Bob is recognized as a proven leader and he has the vision and experience necessary to lead Sikorsky today and into the future.", "The building and industrial systems business had another solid quarter delivering mid-single-digit combined organic sales growth for Otis and CCS. Integration activities continue to progress well with the team finding ways to serve our customers more efficiently.", "BIS continues to also strengthen its presence in emerging markets with several new and expanded joint venture relationships, including the commercial HVAC in China, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The latter 2 were recently expanded to include the broader BIS product portfolio.", "We also completed the acquisition of CIAT, which is a European commercial HVAC manufacturer, and we begin consolidating its results in Q1. BIS also expanded its relationship with Toshiba including the launch of a new variable refrigerant flow, or VRF line of HVAC products in the US market.", "So good momentum. As you heard from the president's in March, each of our businesses is well-positioned in our core markets. This along with continued product innovation will allow us to drive long-term sustainable organic growth. And we're making progress on our corporate led initiatives as well.", "Akhil and the team are making headway towards a simplified corporate cost structure and we're on track to deliver about $100 million in run rate savings by the middle of next year. As Akhil mentioned earlier, we launched an accelerated share repurchase program in March which accounts for most of this year's $3 billion of share repurchase. A lot of value in UTX at these price levels.", "And lastly, we continue to make progress on the evaluation of strategic options for Sikorsky including the potential for a spin. We have nothing new to share today on the topic, but we will let you know when the evaluation process is complete, which I now expect to be roughly midyear.", "So again, for the rest of 2015 at the UTC level, no real changes from what we told you last month. With that let's open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "Hi. Thank you. You mentioned on Sikorsky that the guidance may look a little bit shaky. But just on Otis, the EBIT was down over $50 million year on year in Q1. The guide for the year is I think down $100 million to $150 million, and the currency effect is pretty stable through the year. So maybe give some color as to why that should rebound in the second half. Is it to do with European aftermarket or cost savings coming through?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, so, Julian, I think what we are looking at is the improving signs in Europe to some extent which will help buffer the back half. The 2 watch items for us, as Paul said in his comments, was Europe pricing in the service side and also the China equipment. I think because of the backlog that is coming into the year, the China business will still grow this year. Service business continues to grow very nicely, grew almost 20% again this quarter.", "So, yes, a little shy of the expectations on new equipment in China, but the strength in the Otis Europe new equipment orders would hopefully offset a little bit of that. And America continues to be strong. So we are watching those 2 items, the pricing pressure in Europe and the China new equipment market, but broadly we still feel we can get to the low end of the range at least.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you. And then my second question is just on Pratt & Whitney, the commercial aftermarket business. You gave some helpful color around sort of the underlying trends versus what was reported at the plus 2%. But maybe just how quickly do you think the underlying versus the kind of headline number will come together? Do you still think in Q2 you could see low-single-digit commercial aftermarket sales growth?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, Julian, I think again, we expect an improving aftermarket as we go through the year. And again, as we talked about, at least lower oil prices \u2013 that phenomenon should play out even more strongly I think in the back half of the year as it takes 6 months or so to get people to change purchasing behavior.", "But again, I think it's all kind of out there within the guidance. It started out slow \u2013 Dave Gitlin I think talked about that for the Aerospace Systems group back in March, kind of a slow start. But again, all the signs are there. The RPMs continue to be very strong, especially in the emerging markets, and we expect we will see the engines come back and we will see the parts go out the door.", "Akhil Johri", "Right, the important thing to focus on Julian, there is the transactional spares number that I think Paul talked about, right? Once you strip out the spares used in our own fleet management programs, the spares we sell to airlines or the spares we use in time and material jobs collectively are up about 10%, right. And that is the number which essentially we watch carefully.", "If the FMPs are lower, actually it is good news in the long-term. So I think we're focusing on the right thing here which is the transactional space.", "Julian Mitchell", "Great, thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Carter Copeland", "Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Greg Hayes", "Hey, Carter. ", "Carter Copeland", "Just first quick one on China and the order number. Just kind of digging into that with a little more granularity. If you were to take a look at that either by residential versus commercial infrastructure, or maybe by brand if it were OCL versus Xizi or any way you would like to cut it, is there a difference in the trends that you are seeing there on the order front that you could highlight for us?", "Akhil Johri", "So, residential is a little slower than we expected, that is a big headline first. So in terms of the brand, I think the Otis brand is doing well, obviously, on the Xizi side, which is more in the residential side, we see a bigger impact, as you would expect, because that is the part of the market which is a little slower than we had anticipated. That is probably the broad comment I can offer on that.", "The units \u2013 just as a reminder, the units were flattish for Otis, right. So even the dollar numbers feel like down 12%, but in unit terms, the orders were flattish.", "Carter Copeland", "And are they seeing any change in the backlog conversion? I know you guys have talked about that, carrying that backlog into this year.", "Akhil Johri", "No, that still feels okay. And I think as Geraud said in March, just the conversion of the backlog into sales this year should give you about 5% to 8% \u2013 5% to 6% of sales growth. And then it will all be a function of how many orders we get this year and how much of that gets converted. And that is the math which will give the ultimate new equipment sales in China.", "Carter Copeland", "Great. And then on the Sikorsky front, I wondered if you might give us some color around the commercial spares orders and how much the oil and gas impact may have influenced what you saw there in the quarter.", "Akhil Johri", "The commercial aftermarket for Sikorsky was down double-digit in the quarter. So some of that is just a function of the fact that even the rigs which are operational, actually some of the working rigs have been coming down as well.", "So it is not only the impact associated with the expansion which impacts the OE side more, we have seen some impact on the aftermarket. Now we do believe that aftermarket will actually do better as the year goes through, because production is still continuing in these oil rigs. It is -- the watch item is more the S-92s or the OE deliveries that we need to make for the year.", "Carter Copeland", "Great. Thanks, Akhil.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning. ", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague", "Could you just elaborate or provide detail on kind of the size of the discrete items in the other segments? So I assume the one in Pratt at $0.03 is the largest as you articulated that. But can you give us a little bit more color there?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure, Jeff. So I think it was at CCS we talked about the property sale and the fair value accounting associated with the transaction there. The collective impact of that was a little over $0.02 there, and then the third item was also about $0.02 in the UTAS business, the licensing arrangement that Paul referred to.", "On top of that, there was probably $0.02 you will see in the [elims] line, in the corporate elims line which had to do with some adjustments for a disposed business that shows up in those lines. So net-net it is essentially timing, Jeff. It is just stuff that we had always assumed would happen in the plan.", "We just assumed it would happen actually later in the year and it got pulled \u2013 by chance it all ended up happening in Q1. Which is why I think when I spoke in March we were expecting slightly lowered numbers, but I think it came in stronger just as a result of timing of some of these discrete items.", "Jeff Sprague", "Okay. And then just shifting gears, could you just come back to Otis Europe? You mentioned pricing is a watch item and we all know that's been tough for a while. But are you seeing some change? Is it declining at a decelerating rate or has there been some trend change there? Just what do you see going on there?", "Akhil Johri", "Jeff, it is still the same I would say. I mean, in Q1 what we saw, the pricing decline was consistent with what we saw in Q4 and Q3. But there is no either increase or decrease in the deceleration rate, as you said. What is encouraging though is \u2013 I think Philippe talked about that in March a little bit and he showed a chart that the first sign of change comes from strength in the new equipment market.", "And in fact, if you go back and look at that chart, there were countries where new equipment had done better either in terms of less decline or started to recover, pricing on service was doing better in those markets as well.", "So with the strength we are seeing broad-based in the new equipment order rates this quarter, our expectation is that that starts to get better on the service side in terms of pricing as the year progresses. Now whether it happens quickly enough is something we have to watch. But definitely that is the first sign which would then release a little bit of pressure on the pricing.", "Jeff Sprague", "Okay, thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Akhil Johri", "Hello, hello.", "Ron Epstein", "Yeah, hey. Good morning, guys. There are \u2013 so a quick question back on the engines again. There's been a fair amount of discussion in the trade press that your competitor's engine, the LEAP-1B, is having some issues getting to its performance targets. So there has been some talk that it is missing its targets by maybe 4% or 5%.", "Just curious, have you heard anything from your customers yet that are maybe looking more seriously at the PurePower family of engines if the LEAP engine doesn't seem to be getting where it needs to go?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, I think we have all read that same speculation in the press. But I'll tell you, Ron, it really hasn't impacted any of the competitions that are going on today for engine orders. I think the competitors, GE or CFM is going to commit to the same kind of performance improvements that we are seeing on the GTF family. And I would expect that they will eventually get to the same performance targets that they have committed to.", "So there might be some short-term pain on those engines, but again, I think long-term we like where we are with our architecture. We think the architecture is fundamentally better; we're going to operate at a lower temperature. That gives us some improvement in terms of not just part count but also the maintenance cost long-term.", "So we will see what happens. Those engines are going to go into service at the end of the year on the neo and that will be the ultimate test of performance is how we do in the field. And we feel very good about where we are.", "Ron Epstein", "Sure, sure. And then maybe one last one here. You have already executed on some buyback for the year. And given where the share price is and it looks like it is pretty good darn good value, are you open to buying back a lot more stock?", "Greg Hayes", "A lot more? No. Look, I think at the current price it is a good value. We did the $3 billion or $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase last month and I think that was well executed. And it gives us about a $0.05 benefit for the year by having all those shares retire early.", "But right now I still think there is things out on the M&A side that we want to do and we're going to keep our powder dry. We spent $250 million in the first quarter on M&A; we've got a good business in CIAT in France, which Geraud and team are working on.", "I think that is indicative of the kind of things we will probably see throughout the year, some smaller deals. But we are going to continue to look for bigger things too. And I just don't want to commit to a bunch of share repurchase when there is opportunities out there to do some bigger M&A.", "Ron Epstein", "But could we expect to see some more than what you have already done? Are you done for the year I guess is the question?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, we guided to $3 billion for the year. I think as we go through the quarters here if we don't see additional M&A or if we see some significant weakness in the stock I think we are always open to that where we see value. And we are going to keep that in mind.", "But again, we are going to return more than 70% of free cash flow back to investors this year, probably more than almost 80% with the $3 billion on top of the dividend. So, we feel pretty good about the capital allocation decisions we have made so far.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Akhil Johri", "Yeah.", "Greg Hayes", "True.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Nigel Coe", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. ", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning. ", "Nigel Coe", "Just wanted to come back \u2013 yeah. Hi. Hi there. Just want to come back to the good news on the European Otis orders on the OE side. And when you've been coming off sort of a trough type of number you can get some pretty big numbers. I just wondered, can you maybe just characterize the breadth of the strength that you saw in the OE orders and perhaps comment on the activity you are seeing and whether the strength that we have seen in Otis is also being seen elsewhere such as within Carrier and also Fire & Security?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, sure. So I think the Otis trend was clearly right based. You are exactly right, Nigel. The numbers have gone down, so it is off a smaller base. But still even on that smaller base we saw a decline last year. So the fact that it is up and up nicely, and it is up broad-based \u2013 almost every major country saw up orders in Otis' new equipment, that is an encouraging sign for us.", "So clearly that portends well for all the stuff that is going on in Europe, in terms of the stimulus that is being put in place there, in terms of the euro weakness that is encouraging, the range of growth there. So all those things are hopefully resulting in some better economic activity.", "Commercial refrigeration in Europe, as I said earlier, was up double-digit as well, that was nice to see. And HVAC is up, although at a smaller scale, but it was up as well. So overall we see some improving trends in Europe, that is definitely certainly true in this quarter.", "Nigel Coe", "That's great news. And then maybe just perhaps a bit more color on the CCS margins, up 120 bps. There's obviously a lot going on here with the Transicold mix and the BIS integration and perhaps some price benefits. But maybe just add a bit of color in terms of those drivers.", "Akhil Johri", "Sure. So I think the mix definitely as you point out is good. Transicold grew very strongly and that is one of our high margin businesses. There is broad-based cost-related conversion that we see very nicely at CCS, that has been a story which has been there for a period of time.", "We were obviously also helped a little bit by those discrete items that I talked about and that came from the 2 items that we had \u2013 that I highlighted earlier. But overall it is great conversion on the organic growth.", "I mean organic growth is up 6%. And if you hold gross margin and you control the cost that is a recipe for good conversion. And Geraud and team have been doing that for several years now.", "Nigel Coe", "And then very quickly on the raw materials, are you seeing the benefit right now, is that coming through in the second half of the year?", "Akhil Johri", "Not as much in the first quarter, Nigel. I think there was a little bit of benefit from copper. But as you know, we kind of tend to have longer-term agreements with our suppliers. So we'll see some benefit a little more in the second half, but probably even more than that in the next year. If the prices stay at this level.", "Nigel Coe", "That's great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks so much. Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Oh.", "Robert Stallard", "Greg, you were fairly open at the investor conference about your desire to do more M&A. And I was wondering if that prompted any further response in the market and how you would characterize the quality and availability of the assets that are out there?", "Greg Hayes", "My phone has not been ringing off the hook if that is what you are asking. But I think we said we are \u2013 obviously we are open to M&A, we have got the balance sheet to do bigger M&A and we see opportunities in our core markets to do some things. But at the same time we're trying to be disciplined here in terms of the criteria that we have laid out.", "And we say we need to have an IRR north of 10%, it is got to be accretive in year two, it's got to have an ROIC north of 10% by year four. Those are some pretty high hurdles with the valuations that we see out there today.", "So there are some fixer uppers out there that might be attractive to us. But we are not going to overpay either because that is the best way to make a good deal a bad deal is to overpay.", "You can never recover for that. So we are continuing to look, we've got Mike Dumais and the whole team focused on looking at various properties. And we're just going to be opportunistic.", "Robert Stallard", "Okay, and then as a quick follow-up on foreign-exchange. I'm just wondering why you didn't use this opportunity to maybe bring your forecast for the foreign exchange hit down a bit. And whether foreign exchange has had any impact in terms of market share or other issues overseas?", "Greg Hayes", "No, I think when we guided back in March we talked about euro at 1.10 today it is at 1.07, if it stays here for the rest of the year I think it will average about 1.09. So it is not just a very big impact versus what we talked about a month ago. Obviously if we see euro go towards parity with the dollar that will put pressure on the guidance and probably take us towards the lower end.", "But I think it is important, while we don't hedge transactional FX \u2013 translation FX we do hedge transactional FX. So to the extent we've got a sales contract in one currency and cost in another, we are hedging that on a regular basis.", "And I think the other important thing from a market share perspective, we are not really disadvantaged by currency. We manufacture in Europe, we manufacture in China for those markets. So in that really impacted very dramatically by \u2013 or disadvantaged. And then keep in mind too, more than half of the business is aero and that is all US dollar denominated. So we are neither advantaged or disadvantaged in that market by the currency.", "Robert Stallard", "That's great, thanks so much.", "Greg Hayes", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Akhil Johri", "Good morning. ", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "Noah Poponak", "Greg, just one follow-up to the M&A question there. Are you comfortable doing acquisitions while you are still evaluating the overall portfolio or do you need to get through everything you are contemplating with the portfolio before you know which acquisitions make the most sense?", "Greg Hayes", "We know which markets we like, we know which product lines we like. As you think about this portfolio review that we are doing, as I mentioned last month, we have already divested $8 billion of business in the last 5 years. If we spin Sikorsky up that will be another $7 billion, so we will have done $15 billion in portfolio shedding by the end of this year.", "And there's just not a lot of other big pieces left that we don't think are in attractive markets and there might be some smaller things on the margin. But I think for the most part we like the hand that we've got now in terms of the ability to grow the business long-term organically.", "And so, we are going to look to find pieces that will fit into that puzzle that we have got today and really not try and stretch to find other things outside of the core.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay, great. And then just going back to the aerospace aftermarket, just I guess as a clarification, the comments that that year was off to a slow start in headline numbers I guess made it seem like the actual underlying ongoing business was a little weak.", "But it sounds like actually \u2013 given the numbers you have given us excluding provisioning, that it's actually maybe quite strong and the slow start was entirely the provisioning comparison. Is that a fair comparison or a fair assumption or is there something else?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, I think that is exactly \u2013 as you think about the Aerospace Systems business, the provisioning was down but parts were up nicely almost double digits for the transactional site. The same at Pratt on the transactional side, we saw almost double-digit increases in spare parts sales. So that piece of the aftermarket is actually doing nicely.", "What we have not seen of course is provisioning; that will come in the back half of the year as some of the new aircraft like the A350 in the A320neo enter into service we will see provisioning pick up in the back half of the year.", "So a little slower than what we expected overall. Shop visits were down, but again to Akhil's point that is actually good news as most of these are on FMP, and the longer those things stay on wing the more profitable those contracts are.", "Noah Poponak", "And GE said they are seeing some restocking of inventory from the airlines. Are you seeing that specifically?", "Akhil Johri", "I think you know the issue we have, which is some of our legacy engines, the PW2000 and PW4000 are \u2013 have this issue of legacy spare parts availability and surplus parts available in the marketplace and retirement. So we see declines there.", "In the engine, which is doing well for us, the V2500, actually on a transactional basis we even saw sales up over 30% on the transactional spares. So that was consistent with what you probably heard from the others, so we saw the same phenomenon. We just had to deal with this declining issue on the PW2000 and PW4000.", "Noah Poponak", "Right. Okay, thanks a lot.", "Akhil Johri", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Peter Arment", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Greg, just I guess a follow-on to Noah's question on the aftermarket. Are you seeing any differences from a geographical standpoint? You mentioned a lot that China has been slowing, but are you seeing any trend over onto the airspace side out of Asia?", "Greg Hayes", "No. In fact, Asia is probably the strongest if we think about where the aftermarket \u2013 I mean the RPMs there are up more than 30%, I think, year over year in China. So we continue to see very, very strong growth out of that market. And truly to Akhil's point, I mean it is these legacy 2000, 4000 engines where we are really seeing the slowdown.", "Peter Arment", "Okay, and just my follow-up also is on [indiscernible] and aerospace on Pratt & Whitney. You mentioned the kind of timing of engine shipments. Pratt & Whitney Canada engine volume was down 10% year over year. Is that all timing, or is there something else going on there?", "Akhil Johri", "Pratt Canada engine shipments, Peter, were nicely driven by the helicopter end market. That is where we have seen the big decline. The business jet engines were actually up, largely attributed to the helicopter segment.", "On the other large Pratt side, it is more to do with the military engines where we saw a little bit of delays in a few of the engines there, which hopefully will pick up back in Q2.", "Peter Arment", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "Yes. Good morning. I wanted to pursue first cash flow, the conversion at 67%. I know you mentioned Sikorsky, and maybe that is some of the helicopters from the oil and gas business. But last year's first quarter we were at 80%, and we wound up the year at 90% free cash conversion. And this year we are starting off at 67%, and I think we are hoping to get higher than 90%, at least 90% to 100% from what you say.", "So what goes on here? I mean this quarter we saw sizable increase in inventories, maybe 5% or so. So can you kind of just walk through from where we are to how we get maybe to the 90% to 100% you are talking about for the year?", "Greg Hayes", "First-quarter cash flow is not ever going to probably be close to 100%. Last year we got a benefit of a $200 million advance at Sikorsky, which certainly helped. This year if you take Sikorsky out of the equation, cash flow was almost 100% of net income. So again, really I would point primarily to the Sikorsky cash outflow.", "But at the same time, inventories were up; working capital was up, specifically receivables. And again, though, some of that is just timing as we work through. You know, Geraud's business, it is a seasonal business on the residential side, so there is some natural inventory build in the CCS business. But overall, we are also seeing some inventory on the ramp on the GTF, so Pratt's inventories were up.", "UTAS inventories were up for the same reasons. They see these new aircraft going into production. So again, I think this will get better during the course of year, but we clearly need to focus more on inventory turns because I think overall inventory turns for us were about 4.5, and this really is just not very good. So there is work to do.", "Akhil Johri", "And just one point to add, George, to clarify your comment on the inventory side. We always see build up in inventory Q1. In fact, if you pass the numbers for last year Q1, inventory had actually gone up by $660 million in Q1. This year it was only $470 million.", "Only $470 million is still a big number, and certainly not we are happy with, but that is part of the seasonality that we have in this. And as Greg said, we have a lot of work to do on inventory, but still the Q1 67% does not give us any concern about the ability to meet the 90% to 100% for the year.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And, Akhil, my follow up is if you \u2013 you commented about transactional spares being down should be good news. At what point \u2013 I assume a lot of that is related to your power by the hour contract. So at what point do you conclude that you can make a higher margin on that power by the hour stuff because the reliability is running somewhat better than you might have been projecting?", "", "Akhil Johri", "George, just one clarification first. Transactional spares, which I define as spares sold to the airlines and used in our time and material jobs, are actually up double-digit. What is down was more the spares used in the FMP program.", "So there, to your point, we evaluate the programs on a quarterly basis, at least on an annual basis for every FMP, quarterly for the large ones and look at the estimates based on our actual experience and then update the EACs which result in some kind of adjustments periodically that we see.", "So I think over the long-term this will definitely be good news on the margins at Pratt. How it comes into the P&L exactly is a function of the length of the FMPs, the period which is left and the experience that we have achieved so far.", "George Shapiro", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Doug Harned", "Thank you. Good morning. ", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "Doug Harned", "I wanted to talk about UTAS and in particular just where you stand now on savings from the Goodrich integration. You are in presumably the more challenging time here with supply chain and facilities opportunities.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, so I think we are tracking very, well, Doug, on that on the synergy side. As you know from the original estimates of $375 million we have taken it up over to $500 million. For this year our expectation was about $100 million and we think we are very much on track for that. In fact, if anything, we may have a little upside there given the work that Dave and team have done on eliminating the costs associated with the dual structure that Greg referred to in his comments.", "So the synergies are moving very, very well. I think what is left still in front of the team there is not so much the supply chain related \u2013 the supply negotiation related stuff, but it is more about moves to low-cost sourcing.", "We still have many, many factories in UTAS, nearly 100 manufacturing locations. That is what the team is doing in creating the centers of excellence in lower cost locations such as Poland and Mexico, India, etc. And as work transitions to those lower cost centers of excellence we will see further improvement in the cost structure at UTAS.", "Now obviously at some point we have to stop and get off this synergy word, it becomes a matter of course cost reduction like any other UTC Company does and that is where we are heading now. So I think we can certainly declare we have done the synergies that we expected to achieve and now we need to continue to get regular cost reductions.", "Doug Harned", "Well, and so that is really where I wanted to go. So as you head beyond the synergy word and look at the opportunities here, I know there has been a focus on reducing R&D, reducing costs in general in UTAS. Can you give a sense of how much margin opportunity you see going forward? If we go over the next few years, I mean is this a business where we should expect some pretty good margin expansion?", "Greg Hayes", "Doug, there is always opportunity for margin expansion. I think what we have to keep in mind is as all these new aircraft come into production there is headwind from negative margin not just at Pratt but also a little bit on our Aerospace Systems business.", "And so, I think Mr. Gitlin and crew are going to deal with a little bit of that which will keep some of the margin improvement at bay for a time yet. But clearly there is opportunities out there. I think we talked a couple years ago about this being a potentially 20% margin business, that is still the target I would say for 5 years out.", "So there might be 50 basis points a year of margin upside here, but we need to keep in mind, at least in the short-term, as all of these new products come to market where the margins that are going out are not positive on most of this new OE equipment. So that is going to hold margins down a little bit.", "Doug Harned", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes, thank you very much. So Otis, you had 2% organic growth with high-single-digit new equipment growth. Did service \u2013 I mean it looked like service was down some 3% to 4% result which is the weakest number I think I can ever recall.", "Could you give us a little bit more color on what is happening in the service market and how quickly you might see an improvement in pricing in Europe as a result of the very strong new elevator orders this quarter? Thanks.", "Akhil Johri", "Sure, Cai. Just for clarification, service was flat overall, it was not down. And in fact, where we saw the pressure was more on the modernization side, particularly in Europe where service \u2013 the modernization revenues were down in sort of mid-teens level. And that is a function of our regulation driven modernization effort that was going on in France particularly and a couple of other markets.", "Again, I think maintenance contracts, the number of contracts under maintenance for the quarter were up sequentially when you exclude Russia which was an exceptional situation. But everywhere else I think our maintenance contracts were up.", "Pricing pressure, as I said earlier in response to Jeff's question, is stable. It is still down but it is not getting down any further. And as the new equipment market starts to improve in Europe we expect certainly to see the pricing pressure a little bit relieved on the service side as well.", "So service was good in [Asia], grew mid-single-digit there, particularly in China which was up nearly 20%. And it is growing in America's as well. So just the continuing trends that we have seen in Europe which hopefully get mitigated as new equipment improves.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Great answer. And maybe a little bit more color into Jeff's question. It looks like there is $0.09 of kind of discrete operation \u2013 non-operating or whatever they are items within the operation. You mentioned you have got some favorable timing. Were all those $0.09 pull forwards from succeeding quarters? And maybe give us some color as a result of the kind of quarterly pattern we should expect for the year.", "Akhil Johri", "I think as I said, Cai, the \u2013 those items were in our plan for \u2013 most of them for Q2, so there is a little bit of timing thing. You never can call exactly whether something which is a function of negotiation discussions in some events with other parties can happen exactly in March or April or June. So I think a little bit of that pattern is there.", "I did say that our first half we expect the earnings to be at the higher end or up slightly ahead of the 3% mark that we have for the full year, the zero to 3% on a reported EPS basis. So that would suggest that probably Q2 by itself would be down on a reported basis and that is understandable given the pressure we have on FX and pension and the restructuring which will be in excess of gains in Q2, right.", "In Q2 we will have $0.07 of restructuring and no gains. So that is one reason why the reported numbers start to look a little bit different in Q2. But in reality when you exclude pension, FX and restructuring we should still see mid-single-digit type of growth in Q2 EPS which is slightly below our full-year expectations given the strength we saw in Q1.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Great answer. Thank you very much.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Cai.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much. Greg, it looks like you started out CapEx below trend. Have you been able to get a handle on that to the degree you are satisfied or is there still more work to be done?", "Greg Hayes", "There is still more work to be done, Howard. I think again we saw CapEx for the quarter a little bit \u2013 a little bit up from last are, about $15 million actually year over year. So we spent like $348 million. It is below a full-year run rate, I'll give you that, but there is still work to do. And I think all the guys understand, the people understand we need to be focused on constraining CapEx just like we are in every other dollar that we spent. So there is work to do.", "Howard Rubel", "And then the second item, research and development also was down a little bit. And sometimes that is timing. Could you provide a little more color and granularity on a couple of the development programs, specifically GTF, both for the variety of items you have whether it is neo or the other customers?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, E&D is starting kind of a natural decline at Pratt as we complete some of the testing on the neo and some of the other engines out there. CSeries is completing its flight testing this year, neo will be done hopefully this summer or early fall. So just, E&D just naturally wants to come down.", "If you remember, Paul said he was going to take E&D down about $100 million, was down $17 million here in the first quarter. So naturally you are just going to see a reduction. And not much change across the rest of the business.", "I think Geraud is up a tiny bit, he continues to invest in some new products. And Aerospace Systems are still on track to probably spend about $800 million for the year. So not much change there.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Can I just go back to Transicold which you haven't really talked a lot about? I thought this was probably the toughest compare of the year and yet you did pretty well. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that was container versus truck and trailer and maybe price now versus where it was last year?", "Akhil Johri", "Sam, so, container \u2013 as you know, Transicold is a little bit of a lumpy business. So you get some large swings and large numbers there, but it was great to see the 18% or so growth in the quarter there. A lot of it was driven by container which was up over 30%. North America truck trailer was up nicely as well.", "And in fact the orders in North America truck trailer are very, very strong. And so that is a precursor sometimes to the US economy and how things are doing there. So that is certainly very encouraging and we see good strength there. So both I think container and North America truck trailer were the big drivers. Europe was also up and nicely up as well.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay, thanks. And then in terms of the Geared Turbofan, is there any way you can kind of help us in terms of planned shipments or anything of that sort, how it looks this year and kind of the ramp into next year? Just in any way you can help quantify the volume and that OE headwind that we are going to see as that ramps up?", "Akhil Johri", "I think for this year we have got somewhere in the range of 40 to 50 GTF engines which will be shipped between the neo and the C Series to some extent. And I think that number wants to go up to about 200 for next year. So that is the kind of magnitude of shipments.

(Broker)", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Director, Investor Relations.", "This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download on the UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note, the company will speak to results from continued operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide detail on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate.", "", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the webcast slides, I just want to make a few comments. I'm sure many of you saw yesterday's announcement that UTC has reached an agreement to sell Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin for $9 billion. That of course, is subject to regulatory approvals and the customary closing conditions. We'll be moving Sikorsky to discontinued operations in Q3 and we would expect to close the transaction around year-end, either by December 31 or shortly thereafter in the first quarter of 2016.", "This is a very good deal all around. It's good for Sikorsky's employees and customers, as well as for UTC shareholders. At UTC, we now see a portfolio that's more focused on the core, and that is supplying systems and technologies for commercial buildings and aerospace, and we're better positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders. The balance of our portfolio will continue to deliver over the long-term with clear line of sight to mid-single-digit organic top line growth based on the success of the Geared Turbofan engine at Pratt and higher shipset values on new platforms at our UTC Aerospace Systems business, and of course, a more focused innovative product portfolio in our Commercial businesses. The sale is expected to generate approximately $6.2 billion of available cash. We plan to use the proceeds to repurchase UTX shares, and we would expect to offset the EPS dilution from the loss of Sikorsky earnings through the share buyback program.", "Now coming back to 2015, top line growth remains solid in Q2 with 3% organic growth in a continuing slow global economy. However, as you saw in the press release this morning, we are lowering expectations for the year for EPS. After a half a year of actual results, it's clear that the Commercial aftermarket assumptions that our Aerospace Systems business used were overly optimistic, and this along with continuing weakness in Otis Europe and a significant slowdown of construction markets in China have caused us to reevaluate our outlook for these two segments.", "Needless to say, we're not happy with this performance, and we'll take decisive action in response, including accelerating cost reduction action across the businesses, and aggressively identifying additional structural actions focused on product cost and productivity that can drive earnings growth well into the future.", "We also intend to explore additional benefits from capital deployment, both M&A and share buybacks. Let me assure you while we see near-term weakness in some end markets, the long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products, global scale, and strong market fundamentals, that is RPM growth and urbanization, will allow UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future.", "Akhil and Paul will take you through the Q2 results and revised expectations in more detail in just a second, and I'll be back with some closing comments before we get into the Q&A. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Greg. Before I talk about the full year, let's look at Q2 results and end market trends for a little more context. UTC reported Q2 earnings per share of $1.73, down 6% versus the prior year and in line with the expectations that we discussed last month in Paris. Excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items, EPS was down 2% in the quarter but up 2% for the first half of the year. The stronger dollar was a headwind of $0.13 in the first half, which equates to about 4 points on prior year earnings. Organic sales grew 3% in the quarter, same as the first quarter, and that marks the eighth consecutive quarter of top line organic growth.", "In the Commercial businesses, we saw continuing growth in the Americas, which were up 8%. Asia grew slightly, reflecting the slowing environment in China, which was down low-single digit. And sales in EMEA were flattish in the quarter.", "On the Aerospace side, Commercial grew by 3% as high single-digit original equipment growth was partially offset by the aftermarket, which was flattish. Defense sales were up 5% mainly on higher military engine deliveries at Pratt.", "Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 3, and just a reminder, we'll talk to the Commercial business orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. For our Building Systems businesses, construction markets in the U.S. remain a positive. And we continue to see that at Otis, where North America new equipment orders were up 10%. At CCS, Americas Commercial HVAC equipment orders were also up 10%, and Residential HVAC equipment sales grew 7% in the quarter.", "Turning to EMEA, the overall environment remains mixed, and our BIS order activity reflects that. Transport refrigeration orders in EMEA were a bright spot, up over 25%, while after adjusting for a large order in Saudi Arabia, Otis new equipment orders were up 3%. This was driven by solid growth in Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and Spain, with France and Russia down. Orders for Commercial HVAC in EMEA were flattish.", "In Asia, the China market has clearly slowed. Real estate investment, new construction starts, and floor space sold are all under pressure. Otis new equipment orders in China were down 10% in the quarter, and we also saw a slowdown in the rate of backlog conversion.", "Excluding China, the rest of Asia continues to do well at Otis. At CCS, China orders were down 15% driven by Commercial HVAC. Shifting to Commercial Aerospace aftermarket, at Pratt & Whitney, sales were up slightly with mid-single-digit growth in both Pratt Canada and Large Commercial Engine Transactional Services. Shop visits for engines under fleet management program were lower in the quarter, reflecting our strategy to improve time on-wing.", "UTC Aerospace Systems commercial aftermarket sales were down slightly, largely driven by the ongoing weakness in provisioning and repair. New test parts sales continued to be strong and were up 8% in the quarter, consistent with Q1. Taking a closer look at the second quarter results on Slide 4, total reported sales decreased by 5% as 3% organic growth and a point from acquisitions were more than offset by 4 points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar and 5 points from the absence of the prior-year CMHP adjustment.", "Segment operating profit was down 3% in the quarter and operating margins were 16.6%. Earnings per share of $1.73 were down 6% in the quarter. Recall that restructuring and gains were balanced in the second quarter of 2014 while we saw $0.08 cents of net restructuring and one-time items in the second quarter of 2015.", "Absent the impact of gains and restructuring, earnings per share were down 2% while in constant currency, earnings per share were up 2%. Free cash flow was 76% of net income and was adversely impacted by a payment of about $250 million for the previously discussed German tax matter. Excluding this payment, free cash flow would have been a little over 90% of net income.", "For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to net income of 90% to 100% in 2015, and we are maintaining our placeholder of $1 billion for M&A. On Slide 5, as Greg mentioned, we are lowering our expectations for the year. On a continuing operations basis excluding Sikorsky, we now expect earnings per share of $6.15 to $6.30 on sales of $57 billion to $58 billion, reflecting roughly 3% organic sales growth. That's down from our prior continuing ops expectation of $6.35 to $6.55 EPS on sales of $58 billion to $59 billion.", "So looking at the changes on the right-hand side of the page, UTC Aerospace Systems profit expectations are lower by about $300 million and Otis by about $200 million. So total segment profit growth expectations are down around $0.38 versus our prior forecast. There are no changes to the earnings expectations at CCS or Pratt. We'll offset about $0.15 through lower minority interest, some FX forecast contingency, and lower incentive compensation, among other things.", "Now let's walk through what's driving these changes at UTAS and Otis. So I'm on Slide 6. For UTAS, commercial aftermarket sales look to be down slightly in 2015 now. Our prior expectations included high single-digit sales growth in the commercial aftermarket. We continue to see good demand for parts based on solid airline industry fundamentals. However, after a very strong 2013 and 2014, provisioning now looks to be down about 10% versus our prior expectation of up 10%.", "Repair volumes have also been weaker than expected. In addition, the military Aerospace business is slightly lower both for the OE and the aftermarket segments. So, for UTAS overall, we now expect low single digit organic sales growth for the year, down from the previous expectation of up mid-single digit. Primarily due to this shortfall in high margin aftermarket sales, we are changing UTAS profit expectation to down $25 million to $75 million from up to $25 million to $75 million previously.", "At Otis on slide seven, we haven't yet seen an improvement in the European service business and are adjusting up our expectation of a second-half recovery. We now believe that consistent with first half, EMEA service sales for 2015 will be down mid-single digit as compared with prior expectation of up low single digit. China has also slowed. Overall, we now anticipate Otis organic sales growth to be up low single digit for the year as compared to our prior expectation of up mid-single digit. With this change in the growth outlook, we now expect Otis profit to be down $25 million to $75 million at constant currency compared with our original expectation of up $100 million to $150 million. Including the adverse impact of FX, we expect operating profit at Otis to be down $300 million to $350 million, assuming euro at $1.10 for the balance of the year.", "Let me stop there and turn it over to Paul to take you through the business unit results for the quarter in more detail.", "Paul Lundstrom - Vice President of Finance, CFO -- UTC Climate, Controls & Security - Asia, United Technologies", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. So, turning to page eight, Otis second quarter sales were $3.1 billion and up 1% organically. Profits were $635 million and down 1% at constant currency. Operating profit margins remains strong at 20.5%. Foreign exchange translation was a nine-point sales headwind and an 11-point earnings headwind. Profit was down in the quarter as the unfavorable impact of price and mix more than offset contributions from volume and productivity initiatives.", "New equipment sales grew by 4% in the quarter, with solid double-digit growth in the Americas. EMEA new equipment sales were essentially flat and we saw 4% decline in China driven by weaker orders and a slower conversion of new equipment backlog to sales. Otis service sales were flat overall as a 4% decline in EMEA was offset by mid-single digit growth in Asia. Service sales in the Americas were flat.", "New equipment orders were up 5% in the quarter driven by a large project in the Middle East. New equipment orders in North America were again strong, up 10%; and orders in EMEA were up 32%. Excluding the large Abraj Kudai hotel project in Saudi Arabia, EMEA orders were up 3%. Asia orders were down mid-single digit from weaker demand in China which saw a 10% decline. Outside of China, orders in Asia were up mid-single digit.", "As Akhil mentioned, we now expect Otis profit to be down $25 million to $75 million at constant currency. Including the negative impact of foreign exchange, we expect profit to be down $300 million to $350 million.", "On slide nine, we saw continued momentum at Climate, Controls & Security in the second quarter. Sales grew 8% at constant currency with five points of organic growth and another three points from net acquisitions. Profits were up 6% at constant currency. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a five-point headwind, earnings headwind, and a seven-point sales headwind.", "CCS organic sales growth was led by the Americas where residential HVAC grew 7% and commercial HVAC was up in the low teens. Transicold saw continued strength with sales up low teens. EMEA was essentially flat with growth in F&S products offsetting a decline in commercial HVAC. Asia was also flat in the quarter with declines in China offset by growth elsewhere in the region. Operating profit growth of 6% was primarily driven by a drop-through on organic volume growth and cost benefits, including favorable commodity prices.", "CCS equipment orders were up 4% in the quarter. Transicold was up nearly 30% with broad-based strength across the business. Global commercial HVAC orders were down 5% in the quarter led by a sharp decline in China. CCS continues to expect profit growth of $200 million to $250 million on a constant currency basis on mid-single digit organic sales growth for the full year.", "Solid results in the first half along with better than expected commodities and some favorable non-recurring items mentioned in Q1 helped mitigate pressure from a slowing China and a softer Europe.", "Turning to Aerospace on slide ten, Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 2% in the quarter, largely driven by double-digit growth in military engines. The commercial aftermarket business was up 1%. Within that, large commercial engine transactional sales including both parts and repair were up 4% in the quarter. That was with a V2500 spares increase of nearly 30%, partially offset by declines in legacy platforms.", "Aftermarket shop visits for our fleet management programs were down, which again means engines were on-wing longer, benefiting both customers and Pratt. Pratt operating profit was $489 million, which was down 6%. Headwinds from higher negative engine margin and pension were partially offset by lower E&D spend and a drop-through from higher volume in the military engines business. The absence of last year's gain on the sale of a product line was a headwind, but it was more than offset by another noncore product line sale and a contract closeout.", "Looking at our 2015 full-year expectations, we now expect commercial aftermarket sales to be up low single digit; that's down from our prior expectations of up high single digit. Higher military engine sales, better commercial aftermarket margins, and lower E&D spending will offset the impact from the lower commercial aftermarket volume, and so we still feel comfortable with the full-year guidance at Pratt.", "Turning to slide 11, UTC Aerospace Systems profits were $580 million in the quarter, which was down 4%. Sales of $3.6 billion grew 2% organically in the quarter. Similar to what we mentioned last quarter, sales include the benefit from a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass-through sales with no margin.", "Commercial aftermarket sales were flattish and continue to be below expectations with lower provisioning and maintenance sales in our repair shops, offset by high single digit growth in parts volume. We've seen a 10% decline in provisioning so far this year. That's very different than the 10% growth we envisioned for 2015, driven by lower 787 activity, as well as the impact of higher surplus equipment availability for legacy fleets. The lower repair activity reflects better reliability, the impact of competitive pricing pressure, and airline maintenance efficiencies.", "On profit, the year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE mix, and higher pension expense, partially offset by continued cost reduction. In addition, the absence of last year's customer contract settlement benefit was partially offset by other favorable contract settlements this quarter. As Akhil mentioned, we are lowering our profit expectations for UTC Aerospace Systems to be down $25 million to $75 million.", "Turning to Sikorsky on slide 12, operating profit increased 26% on a 6% organic sales improvement in the quarter. Organic sales growth was driven by higher development program sales led by the ramp-up of the U.S. Presidential and Combat Rescue Helicopter programs. Overall aircraft shipment volumes were down compared to the prior year, but aircraft completion \u2013 again, that's the aircraft customization that occurs following baseline delivery, those completions were up significantly over the prior year.", "So overall, growth from development programs and aircraft completions were partially offset by lower military and commercial aftermarket volumes. The operating profit improvement was driven by favorable year-over-year contract adjustments and drop-through from higher development volume, offset by lower commercial aftermarket volume.", "With that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Paul. So, disappointing news on the Otis guidance, on the UTAS guidance; but there are still positives, and I think we need to reflect on that as we think about the quarter. These positives actually support the long-term investment thesis of UTC.", "First of all, we continue to achieve significant milestones on our programs. We secured key wins, and we've positioned the portfolio now to drive long-term shareholder value. As you know, we announced significant wins across our Aerospace business at the Paris Air Show last month. Pratt & Whitney announced additional orders for over 600 Geared Turbofan engines including options reflecting continued strong customer demand. Turkish Airlines and the Korean Air both selected the GTF for the A321neo aircraft at the Air Show. Customers can see the advantage of our engine and have placed firm and option orders for about 7,000 engines.", "And in our commercial businesses, we also continue to secure key wins. As Paul mentioned earlier, Otis secured an order worth more than $100 million for the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. The win includes 370 elevators and 104 escalators for what will be the world's largest hotel when it opens in 2017.", "So again, the long-term growth story hasn't changed. Our businesses continue to be well-positioned in our core markets, and this, along with ongoing product innovation will allow us to drive sustainable organic growth. As I said at the beginning of the call, with the divestiture of Sikorsky, our portfolio is more focused on the core, that is, Aerospace and Commercial Buildings, and we're better positioned to drive long-term shareholder value.", "Finally, before we wrap up, I would like to thank the many folks from Sikorsky and the corporate office who have worked tirelessly over the last couple of months to complete the Sikorsky transaction, and while we're not quite done, I think it's been great work by the entire team and just want to thank them publicly for that.", "So with that, let me stop and let's see what's on everybody's mind. Questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.", "Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Mr. Sprague.", "Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Two questions, Greg. The first one actually, much bigger-picture. With Sikorsky out of the way obviously, and the redeployment can roughly replace that, but you also alluded to other actions. And just thinking about your flexibility here and how you might push things, right, Sikorsky might be actually a little bit credit-negative. Therefore, if you do something else, you need to be more aggressive with the balance sheet or use equity or some combination thereof. Just, where is your head on that and where is the pipeline on what might be the next step once we get past Sikorsky?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's a good question, Jeff. But, we have been focused for the last three months as you can imagine on the divestiture of Sikorsky. I think we're done with the big divestitures. We've done $15 billion now, including Sikorsky in the last five years, so we like the portfolio that we have as a base off which to grow. And so the question is with capital deployment, where are we going to grow? Are we going to do more share buyback? Are we going to go to M&A? Obviously the preference is M&A. You alluded to the credit metrics, Jeff. I think obviously, the spin versus the sale to Lockheed Martin, that doesn't really change the credit metrics that much. And I still think we have flexibility on the balance sheet to do things. And so the team is focused right now on M&A. We've got some things in our sights that hopefully can come to fruition this year, but we're going to be more aggressive. I think we have to continue to use the balance sheet to grow the portfolio.", "Absent that, there is share buyback, and I think we're never going to say no to more share buyback. I recognize that puts stress on the debt rating, but we're going to do what's right for shareholders to make sure that we're driving long-term sustainable growth.", "Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And then just thinking about the outlook, Greg, I don't know if you can hear it from your seat, but certainly there's a lot of murmuring out there that something isn't quite right, and this just doesn't feel like the UTX we've come to know with kind of the water torture on the guidance. What is your confidence level now on where you cut things? How aggressive is the forecast as it stands today, and where is kind of the soft spot in the guide still in your view?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good question, Jeff. Look, to say that I'm disappointed would be a significant understatement. We're all disappointed in having to take the guidance down. We talked back in June about softness in Aerospace aftermarket at UTAS, and we talked about Europe. What we have tried to do today is to put a stop on the downside. And I think the guidance that we've given for both Otis and for the Aerospace Systems group is guidance we feel confident that we can hit. And I'm tired of delivering bad news. And so, we've probably been more aggressive on the downside because we don't want to overpromise and underdeliver.", "And it's tough to do. It's tough to get this bad news out, but quite frankly, as we closed out the second quarter and we met with the folks at UTAS and we met with the Otis team with Geraud and company, it became apparent that we weren't going to be able to hit the guidance numbers that we had laid out. Europe, we had expected a recovery there kind of up low-single digits. It's going to be down low-single digits. We continue to see pricing pressure in the Otis aftermarket in Europe. The slowdown in China is worse than what we had expected. And on the Aerospace Systems side, we were way too aggressive in terms of our assumptions for the provisioning of spare items.", "The spare parts are fine at UTAS. There's some other things that are moving around, but ultimately it's the provisioning orders from airlines which, as Akhil said had been up nicely in 2013 and 2014 and we expected them to be up another 10% this year. This forecast assumes we're going to be down 10%, which I think is probably, we hope worst-case.", "So I think we've bounded the guidance on the downside. And the whole idea here is, let's not deliver more bad news, and let's position the company to grow earnings next year. And as I said, some of the headwinds that we're seeing this year, they're going to continue into next year. I think the negative engine margin at Pratt doesn't go away. The China slowness doesn't go away, and the European economy doesn't miraculously recover. But there are bright spots, and I think the U.S. economy is a lot better than what we had expected this year, and that should continue. The Aerospace aftermarket will continue to grow.", "And I think we're trying to do is the right thing long-term for the business in terms of making these tough decisions today, and we're going to take another hard look at restructuring. I think there's more to do from a cost takeout standpoint. There's more to do that we can position ourselves to make sure we're not going to disappoint into the future. So, look, we're beyond disappointed about this, but we're going to fix it. And we're going to get back to the UTC mantra of underpromise and overdeliver.", "Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. Greg, when I look at the, kind of the underlying expectation for EPS for this year of $6.30, is it \u2013 is the right way to think about it to add back the Sikorsky and then, that's the base from which to grow? Or are we really talking about inclusive of the repurchase effort on Sikorsky, that that's what we're growing to \u2013 so you're pretty using the $6.15 to $6.30 base and a target of 10% on that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think the key there, Myles, is \u2013 well, the Sikorsky transaction will close, let's call it January 1. We'll take the net proceeds and we'll start buying back stock. You're not going to get the full benefit of the stock buyback next year. You'll probably get 80% of it. So if you think about it, we'll replace 80% of Sikorsky's earnings next year and the remaining 20% the following year, just because it takes us a while to buy back what will probably be somewhere between 55 million shares and 60 million shares of UTX stock. So you just don't do that overnight unfortunately.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And then, Akhil, the $0.15, it sounded pretty temporary. So is that permanent cost takeout or business improvement, or is that going to be headwind to 2016?", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Some of it is going to be headwind, Myles, because as I said, it's incentive comp coming down this year. We hope that we will do better next year then \u2013 in which case, the incentive comp will have to go back up. Some of it is just, it was a release of contingency that we had. You recall, the Otis guidance previously was at $1.13/Euro, and we had a slight contingency at the UTC level at $1.10/Euro, Otis and CCS both. So that's just the math of contingency release, if you will. So I would say they are not necessarily permanent. On the other hand, we do have more permanent cost reduction actions coming out of the corporate office which we should see the benefit for in next year.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. I'll stick to two questions. Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Myles.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. I want to go to Pratt for a moment. At the Air Show, you talked about GTF getting up and flying again early this month. And I think the last reported news is that that's not happened. How are you thinking about the risk there, Greg?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So we've been working closely with Airbus, and do I think \u2013 they've got the flight test engines back in Toulouse right now. We expect to be up in the air I think early next week. And right now, it looks like we'll complete the flight test program in the September timeframe, certification of the aircraft in November, and entry into service in December. So, still targeting year-end entry in the service. I think we'll probably ship about 36 engines or so to Airbus this year, and that we're still on schedule to do that. So, yeah, it's a little bit of a delay. As you know, these things just always take more time. But it's not like their guys have been sitting there doing nothing. They've been doing a lot of ground test runs and the other testing that they can do before return to flight. So we feel pretty good about this schedule right now.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "And then, second is I'm sure you have never seen a gain that you didn't want to take advantage of in some fashion. How are you going to think about this? I mean, some of it obviously, will flow to the bottom line, but some of it can really change the nature of how you think about yourself and where you want to go in the future. Can you \u2013 I know it's premature to some degree, but it's been there for a while. So maybe if you could give us some general constructs on what you're thinking about?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think it's a very good question, Howard. I think the fact that we will have a very large gain on Sikorsky and passing through the gain in terms of EPS has never been something we thought we got paid for from the share owners. So I think this will be thought of very similar, and that's why I've asked the guys to take a very hard look at big structural cost reductions that can help us better position the business longer-term. And again, I don't have a plan today of what we're going to do. We've got in my view, six months while we're working on closing the Sikorsky transaction to figure out what all of those actions are. But my goal would be to use the gain and do significant additional restructuring.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks. I just wondered within Aerospace Systems if you can maybe split out within that Commercial aftermarket, volume cut of $250 million, how much is competition, which I think you talked about in Paris as well, versus just kind of provisioning and repair top-line weakness, and whether you think those issues at Aero Systems could persist through into next year as well?", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure, Julian. So if you think about what makes up the Commercial aftermarket at UTAS, roughly $4.5 billion as Gitlin mentioned in Paris, that's made up of spare parts about $1.5 billion or so, provisioning of a little over $1 billion, and $1.8 billion or so of the repair business. The biggest change actually is in the provisioning part of it as Greg said, which was expected to be up 10% on the back of \u2013 up 12% in (34:10), and up 19% in 2014, so very strong provisioning growth in 2012 \u2013 in 2013 and 2014. We had expectations for a 10% increase assuming that some of that strength which we saw through Boeing 787 would continue. We had assumed that in spite of fewer operators taking new aircraft in 2015, we would see almost similar level of Boeing 787 activity in 2015 as we saw in 2014. That's obviously not happened at this point. It's looking more like we will probably be down roughly 40% on the Boeing 787 portion of the provisioning. And then, on the legacy side also, we had seen slower take-up than we had seen in 2013 and 2014, partly due to maybe high level of inventory of provisioning parts at the airlines.", "And I think that's been the biggest change. So that's not really competition. It's probably more a function of the inventory at the airlines and the resetting of the expectations on Boeing 787. The provisioning associated with new aircraft A350 and the A320neo that David talked about, we still expect that to happen, and that should come through in the second half.", "On the repairs side which is where the competition part is, as you said, again, there we have seen the better reliability of the products translating into lower activity, lower repair activity, which is creating some pricing pressure. And that, we do feel that with the surplus part availability and the airlines using green time, specifically for out-of-production aircraft, has had some impact on our expectation on the repair side as well. That phenomena might continue for a little longer, but we do think provisioning should come back. The piece parts business has \u2013 is \u2013 continues to do well, maybe just a little bit lower, but still up high-single digits as compared to our prior expectation of 10%. So hopefully that gives you color on UTAS.", "Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "That's very helpful. And then my second question would just be on Otis. Not so much the sort of end market trends because you laid those out very clearly, but more in terms of Otis' own kind of strategy, how you look at the competitive landscape. I mean, are there things you think you can do differently? Because at the moment, it feels like market share may be going down, margins going down as well. So is there any kind of rethink about what Otis needs to do from here to reverse those things?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Julian, I think the \u2013 Otis \u2013 the key for Otis really, is to regain market share. Over the last 10 years or 15 years, we've seen a continued erosion of Otis market share as we have pursued margin expansion, and I think we have taken margin expansion to the point now where we're not terribly competitive based on new equipment pricing. And quite frankly, you've got to feed the service business with new equipment orders. And so, we're starting to see a pick-up in new equipment in the U.S. We've started to see a little bit in Europe, but we've seen a big slowdown in China.", "And I think we need to fundamentally think about how we're going to grow top-line new equipment and regain market share, and so Jerome and the team are laser-focused on coming up with strategies to regain share. There's also the issue of course, of service in Europe, and that is probably the biggest issue. Otis has 1.9 million elevators under service, about 1.1 million of those are in Europe. And that's where we've seen the biggest pricing pressure, and we've seen no growth in that market for the last couple of years. So we've got to return to growth on new equipment, and we've got to stem the service degradation and pricing that we've seen in Europe as well.", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So one of the things which the team is focused on, Julian, is to try and address the attrition of the service contracts that happens in the business on a normal course, and Jerome has put a lot of focus on making sure that our attrition rates, particularly in Europe come down from what we have seen over the last few years. Secondly, we need to continue to work on developing the technology base differentiation in our service offering. That can then allow us to command the price premium that we've always had in the service markets in Europe as well. And finally, we're going to continue to look for a little bit more of acquisition of service portfolios to help density which is the name of the game, as you know on the service side.", "So I think those are some of the things that are being worked on to improve the service situation in Europe faster. Ultimately, we do believe as the new equipment market improves in Europe \u2013 which there are some early signs of, still mixed, but certain markets like Spain is showing signs of improvement, which has been down for a long time, that will certainly reduce a little bit of pressure on the service side as more activity starts to happen on new equipment.", "Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Julian.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just a quick question \u2013 first one on China. How much, when you look at the revision to the full-year plan, how much sequentially are you planning on China revenues at Otis being down in the second half? And if you can break that up, residential versus the service and infrastructure pieces, it would look like that's \u2013 you're expecting declines there in the sort of 30% in the year-on-year comparisons in Residential. Is that about right, or how should we think about the exit rate in the back half of the year?", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "For the \u2013 I'm not sure I understand the 30% comment, Carter, but overall, I would say for Otis new equipment, we expect China to be down probably low-single digit in the back half of this year in terms of sales, and order rates obviously, could be \u2013 that's the more uncertain part, but that, as you know very well, it doesn't necessarily impact the current year as much.", "The positive think on Otis in China is that the service market continues to grow. We all know it's a small base, but in spite of all the turmoil in the construction industry there, the service business in China for Otis grew again, 15% in the current quarter, which was encouraging. And then, with regard to the breakup between, say, Residential and Commercial, if that's what you were asking on the Otis side, I can tell you from a brand perspective, certainly the Otis brand which is more on the large commercial prestigious jobs did a lot better both in terms of new equipment orders and in terms of new equipment sales in the quarter than the Xizi brand which is more at the residential and the lower end of the segment.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And can you quantify the magnitude of OCL and how much it was up versus Xizi and how much it was down?", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So in terms of new equipment orders, 10%, I think OCL was flattish, maybe just down slightly, while Xizi orders was down in teens.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And then just...", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "(41:23) 10%.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And then just kind of a bigger-picture question on the just the planning process, Greg, when you look at the \u2013 Akhil's comments about the expectations for 10% growth in provisioning on the back of a 12% year and on the back of a 19% year the year before that, I guess when you look at that plan and say, what was missed or what was it about the specific parts that are being procured or the planning function that drove that kind of outcome that can be so far off, and when you look back on that, any color about how a miss like that can be that far off in what we think of as a pretty stable aftermarket business?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think to Akhil's earlier point, when we came off of two very, very strong years of provisioning growth, I think we just assumed that we were going to continue to see that kind of growth. And even \u2013 like Akhil said, it was 19% last year, so we thought it would slow down to 10% this year. There were plans by airline where that provisioning was going to come from. But the fact is they didn't \u2013 the airlines, for various reasons, didn't take the provisioning. The rollout of the neo and the CSeries has been slower than what we expected, so we haven't seen provisioning there.", "But I'll tell you that probably the root cause is we pushed the Aerospace Systems guys to have a plan that was going to be up roughly $300 million for the year. And in order to do that, they had to push the aftermarket guys to deliver a much bigger number. And at the end of the day, I don't think there was a strong basis in that aftermarket assumption around how we were going to get there. They \u2013 again, they were looking at trends, but I don't think we delved deep enough into \u2013 or we didn't question enough the assumptions underlying how they were going to get there.", "And so I would tell you that's a miss on my part, that's a miss on our part from a planning perspective that we didn't dig deep enough last year when these plans were getting put together. And we have obviously spent a lot of time in the last month, Akhil and myself, with the team \u2013 with Dave Gitlin's team, and we've done the same thing with Geraud on the Otis side.", "We have dug deep into this in terms of the planning assumptions. And I think on the Otis, it's actually easier to understand, because there we'd expected a recovery in Europe, like Akhil said; kind of up low single digits, and it's not there. In fact, it's still going to be down. But the aftermarket assumption at UTAS, that's just a miss.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for the color, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. And Greg, the comments about the desire not to deliver any more bad news is well taken. The question we're getting is why didn't you opt to do this at the Paris Air Show when you adjusted Sikorsky? And did you not have enough information at that point? Because it seems pretty clear that you were going to fall far short on both Otis China and the UTAS aftermarket.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Nigel, we \u2013 obviously we had expected some pressure on the UTAS guidance. I think Dave signaled that. Had we taken the number down in early June, I would tell you we wouldn't have taken it down enough though. And our concern was let's make sure we really understand how bad this is. Dave had some plans in the back half of June in terms of orders that he expected to get that he didn't get; and quite frankly, it was a lot worse than I think Dave or anybody else expected when he stood up in June. So, in that respect, we could have taken it down a little bit, but it wouldn't have been enough.", "On the Otis side, again, I think that we were still hoping for some recovery, better news out of China in June. It's a big month for orders. And we're also expecting to hopefully see a reversal of trend in the European market that we have not seen. Again, the Europe stuff, easier for me to understand in terms of from a forecast standpoint, we had a big assumption, we were wrong. Okay. But on the Aerospace Systems side, that was just, again, a big miss.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And, I mean, obviously there was a lot of transition going on at the end of last year. But it did feel like the plan was a little bit too blue sky, not just on the provision side but Otis China and one or two other areas. Is that recognized and are you putting in steps to cure that problem?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, just on Otis China, we entered the year with a 13% increase in backlog, and we had expected orders to be only up about 5% for the year. The fact is orders are down 10%. So, yeah, maybe we were too aggressive there. But a 5% increase didn't seem like overly aggressive from a new equipment standpoint. Property market's come down a lot faster in China than we expected. We've seen a lot of pressure there. And I think, the other planning assumptions, did we push hard? Yeah, we did.", "To your point, there was a lot of transition last year. Obviously been a lot of changes since we put these plans together. But, again, I'll tell you, it all ultimately falls on me; and it's my responsibility to make sure that the forecasts we put together are the right forecasts. And I think we just got way too aggressive on the aftermarket at UTAS and the European recovery. And it hasn't happened.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Fair enough. And then just finally, Greg, on the Sikorsky, the buyback from the proceeds, do you intend to get a little bit ahead of the closure on Sikorsky with that buyback or do we have to wait until we get the cash in before we can do the bulk of that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think, Nigel, we'll have to see is what happens with the stock price here over the next couple of months. Obviously, as we get certainty of close and we'll see, I would think in the next three or four months, I think we'll have an indication from the Department of Defense and from Justice and from the other regulatory authorities about certainty of close. And whether we wait 'til the day I see the $9 billion clear or we do it a month or so early, I think that'll just be determined upon the market and what we see with the stock price", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Your line is now open.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Greg, I want to follow up on your market share comments on Otis. Was that comment specifically addressed to the China market where it appears that your competitors are doing a little bit better than you are? Because it looks like in North America, you've done pretty well. Can you just give a little bit more color around your comment on Otis market share?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think, overall, Otis has lost share really across most markets except North America. I think the North American market has actually remained relatively robust for us from a market share standpoint; but clearly, we've lost share in China. You recall seven or eight years ago, we thought we had roughly 25% market share; today, that number is probably less than 15%. And I think, again, some of the competitors have come in under us from a pricing standpoint, probably been more aggressive, and we have lost share. It's not just in China; but obviously, China is the biggest market by a factor of, I don't know, three or four or more. So, that's really where the lion's share of where the market share loss has been.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "And then thinking about Otis in the 2016, obviously, given the lead times on new equipment. We already have a bit of a clue what 2016 is going to look like. Can you help us in terms of thinking about 2016 for Otis? I mean, at this point, should we expect China to be down next year on the new equipment side in terms of sales?", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. It's a little early to talk about 2016 in specifics, but I think it's not too difficult to project that China is likely to be down next year, right, in terms of new equipment. So, you'd see pressure in China by far, even in dollar terms, it's more than 40% of Otis new equipment sales. So, therefore, that market is going to be under pressure.", "The question is \u2013 and that's a determination we all have to make together over the next three, four, five months as we come close to giving guidance for 2016, what happens in Europe? Because if the European service market starts to recover and the European economy start to get better, that can, because it's such a large business and it's profitable business, can offset some of the issues that we might see in China. We do expect U.S. to continue to be strong, but the real question mark is what happens to Europe and whether it is enough to offset China or not.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Good morning. Greg, if you could maybe walk us through how are you thinking about the portfolio now? I mean, there are some quotes that you may be made this morning in the press that you were saying that UTC is done getting smaller. Can you elaborate on that? And then part of that is what do you see now as the long-term organic growth of the company? I mean, is UTC just sort of fixed now (50:46) forever being sort of like a global GDP grower, or how do you think about that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, let's talk about first of all the portfolio. And as I said last year when I took over, we were going to take a hard look at the portfolio. I think we have done that for all of the major pieces of the portfolio. Obviously, shedding Sikorsky was a big decision. But for the most part, I would tell you \u2013 and as I think I said this morning when we were talking to some reporters, is we're done getting smaller at UTC. We've shed $15 billion in sales since 2010; and again, most end markets where we didn't see great growth or we saw a lot of uncertainty or very low margin business. So, I think the portfolio that we have today is positioned to grow a heck of a lot faster than any of those businesses that we left.", "And you think about Pratt, again, this quarter sales growth, okay, nothing to write home about; but the fact is, we'll be shipping 7,000 GTF engines over the next ten years. Pratt's top line is going to go from $15 billion to $25 billion. You're going to see very solid organic growth there. The same on the Aerospace Systems side, as you get through all of these new programs. We've got more than 50 new systems on these new aircraft that are going to be delivered. So, the long-term organic growth story on the Aerospace side I think is solid. It remains solid I would tell you on the CCS side.", "Over in BIS, we've seen very good continued growth there. The Otis business is a challenge, and I think we had expected kind of mid-single digit growth. It's probably only going to be 2% for this year. We've got to, again, get \u2013 return to market share growth in order to make sure that we're driving more than GDP growth in the Otis business. So, there's work to do there.", "But I would tell you, the portfolio as far as the platforms that we want to be in, is exactly right. I think, again, we've got a good balance between commercial and Aerospace, and I don't see any more big divestitures. I think instead what we're trying to do is we're going to build this business and we're going to build it through M&A. And to the extent that we can't find M&A that creates value, we're going to return the capital to you guys, and let you guys invest it. But right now, our goal is to grow UTC and I think we can grow organically even without big M&A. But we're going to look to find ways where we can add M&A that makes a lot of sense and that creates value.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got you. And if I can, just one follow-on on one of your earlier comments. You talked about pushing the plan in UTAS and that the aftermarket guys came back. I mean, Culturally, does bad news flow up at UTC or is that something within the culture of the company that has to change?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It does now. Look, I think there was a reluctance from people to flow bad news up. And I think if (53:39) people took the challenges and they tried to figure out a way to do that. And for the most part, the Aerospace Systems guys have done a good job over the last three years since the acquisition of delivering on their commitments; and so, I can't fault them for one awful year.", "The business is still going to generate $2.5 billion of profit this year. It's just not going to grow. And shame on us on the forecast side, but the fact is we need to make sure that when there is bad news, it does flow up and we understand what the issues and challenges are. And so, Akhil and I have put that in process. We're out; we're doing more business reviews; we're spending more time on the road to make sure that we truly understand what's going on in these individual businesses. And again, I think that was a discipline that we had lost over the last few years and we've got to put back in place.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Greg, I just want to go back on a comment you just made about if you can't find high return M&A, you would return the capital. Can you just kind of talk through how selling Sikorsky and paying on the order of 31% taxes, makes \u2013 that tax leakage makes more sense than just having spun it out, and how you thought about that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Okay. Let's walk through that. So, when we looked at Sikorsky as a stand-alone business, we'll do about $600 million in EBIT this year. However, when we did the spin, we were going to add about $100 million dollars of cost to the Sikorsky business, or it could be stand-alone business; that's IT, that's finance, treasury. All those things that UTC provides have to be done on a stand-alone basis. And so, when we looked at Sikorsky stand-alone, we thought about our business was worth \u2013 did about $500 million of EBIT, and we figured it would trade for around 10 times EBIT as a defense contractor, which is kind of a market multiple.", "That gave you a $5 billion valuation for Sikorsky if we spun it out. Even if you got a 10% or 15% premium on that $5 billion for a potential takeout, you're still looking at less than $6 billion of value in terms of what is Sikorsky worth as a stand-alone business. I think of the fact that we're going to net over $6 billion on this deal and the fact that it's certain, it's today, it's cash, made a heck of a lot more sense than the risk associated with a spin, the cost, and how the market reacts.", "And I think Sikorsky will have a tough couple of years in front of it. They've got some big development issues and programs they've got to get past. It's a very solid company long-term with great technology, but that $5 billion valuation wasn't even certain. So, when I got an offer that I considered to be compelling with a company that I thought was the perfect fit for Sikorsky, we did the math and it came out to be pretty simple in the end.", "Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then also this year, you had been talking about $300 million worth of gains in restructuring. I imagine some portion of that was going to Sikorsky in terms of the actions. Do you slow those down or stop those? And does that give you any sort of net gain over restructuring, or how do you think about that?", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Not materially, Sam. I think there was some amount of restructuring that you saw in the second quarter at Sikorsky; it's in $25 million range if I recall or somewhere in that range. I think we continue to do the right think for Sikorsky, and that's why Bob Leduc launched the action early as the volume fell off. But I wouldn't expect for that to have a material impact in the back half.", "Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted...", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "...to go back to Otis for one second. You mentioned the backlog conversion in China is slowing. I was wondering if you could offer just a little bit more color on that. How bad is it getting, the conversion? And if you could reflect on maybe some prior cycles, maybe in other geographies, maybe we can learn a bit from what we've seen in other geographies in different time periods to get an understanding of how bad that backlog conversion can get and whether there's still further risk there.", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure, Jason. I think typically what we find at Otis is that you see a 60% conversion of the opening backlog, and then the rest of the sales essentially comes from current-year orders. What we've seen is a couple, two to three points slowdown in that conversion rate from the backlog this year, and that's largely due to the credit availability issues in the China market.", "We typically like to have \u2013 to make sure that we get our money before we release equipment, and that's where we have seen some of the slowdown in the conversion. So, at this point, the team believes it's appropriately sized, two to three points and maybe there could be a point or two to go which is what we have factored in to our back half forecast here for China right now. So, between 55% to 60% conversion should still be possible and doable.", "Obviously, as you know, the Chinese government is doing everything it can to try and help the economy improve the credit availability in the marketplace at some of what they can do and to prop up the real estate markets again. So, we'll see where it all ends up but I think we are appropriately sized at this point.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. And then one question on the commercial aftermarket. There were two phrases that you used there that I found interesting: pricing pressure and part availability. Obviously, it sounds like we've got quite a bit of inventory out there. I was wondering if you could make some attribution as to where that part availability or inventory is coming from. Are we seeing more parked aircraft of where (59:51) your installed base is shrinking perhaps a little bit for the aircraft? Yeah.", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I would say it's not so much about retirements or part availability. I would attribute it more to airline efficiency in the sense that there is greater \u2013 in the marketplace, there is more efficiency in terms of either pulling up parts, surplus parts, are easier identification of where the parts are.", "So, when an airline is looking for a particular item for repair, it almost feels like it's a little easier these days to find that part in the surplus market as opposed to necessarily going for the new one. That's probably the change that is there of the airline efficiency part, I would call it. It's not that the retirements are going up. It is just that the market is a little more efficient now.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And no pricing pressure from P&A (1:00:42) or any other issues? You think that encapsulates all of the pricing pressure?", "Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No, and I think there our strategy of going for more FMPs in the parts (1:00:55) situation where we are getting more than 80% of our engines now under fleet management program and improving that rate to over 60% in the case of the C.A.R.E. program for UTAS is the right strategy to address that part of the issue.", "It's more about making sure we have a larger part of the service activity under our management and under our control, which helps the airlines as well, because we do a much better job of maintaining the aircraft and our parts for them and they're under our program, in the fleet management program.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions. Like to hand the call back over to Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thank you very much. And thanks, everyone, for listening today. Not the results that you would come to expect from UTC, but you can be assured that we are working it diligently. The IR team with Paul and company will be available throughout the day to take your questions, and have a great day.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Vice President, Investor Relations.", "This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations and excluding restructuring costs and significant other items of non-recurring and/or non-operational nature often referred to by management as significant other items. The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other Forward-Looking Statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "UTC's SEC filings include its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay. Thank you, Kailey and good morning everyone. As you saw in today's press release, we reported full-year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30 that's at the high end of the guidance range that you gave for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion and segment operating margins were solid 16.7% for the year. I'm pleased to say that despite a very tough macro environment, we remain confident at our full-year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 a share that's on sales with $56 billion to $58 billion.", "As I reflect back on 2015, we took a number of decisive actions, and I'm encouraged by the progress that team has made on our strategic priorities. First of all we streamlined the portfolio, we simplified the organization structure and we returned $12 billion to shareowners and most importantly perhaps, we achieved some key program milestones.", "As you know, we announced this and closed the sale on Sikorsky for very good price $9 billion and that generated a $3.4 billion after tax again in the fourth quarter, and enabled us to initiate a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November.", "As a result of the divestiture, UTC is now more focused on its core businesses that\u2019s creating and supplying innovative and game-changing technologies for the building and aerospace industries. Going forward, this portfolio will have a better organic growth profile, we will have higher operating margins and we will have stronger cash flows.", "We've also simplified the organization, we eliminated the proportion in aerospace systems layer and the building and industrial systems layer. That creates a flatter more efficient structure with greater visibility and importantly greater accountability and we now have four focused business units that are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth.", "On the cost front, we announced a $5 billion multiyear restructuring plan and that includes $400 million of restructuring we initiated in 2015. And that restructuring is focused on enhancing the long-term cost competitiveness of the company. We expect this restructuring plan to generate about $900 million in run rate savings by 2019.", "We also returned over $12 billion to shareowners last year through dividend and share repurchases that includes the $6 billion ASR we announced in November. After completion of the ASR, this year we continue to expect to return at least another $3 billion through additional share repurchase plus more than $2 billion of dividends through the year.", "Clearly the best M&A opportunity we see right now is UTX stock, we'll continue our share repurchase program as long as we feel there is a significant discount between the intrinsic value of the UTC and the share price.", "While this program execution continues to be a top priority and we achieved several key milestones in 2015. The Pratt Powered Joint Strike Fighter achieved initial operational capability for the marines back in July. The A320neo Aircraft was certified, a CSeries Aircraft was certified both with Pratt\u2019s Geared Turbofan engines and a number of UTAS systems.", "The Mitsubishi Regional Jet also had its first flight and the Embraer Air Engine began testing on our flying test bed. These are programs that will drive growth for decades to come, not only at Pratt but at our UTC Aerospace Systems business as well. I'm glad to say that the dream of the GTF is now a reality.", "The first Pratt & Whitney powered A320neo was delivered last week to Lufthansa and entered into revenue service this past Monday And we\u2019re meeting our commitments on day-one for fuel burn, emissions and noise and the first time in aerospace history that an engine delivered everything it was supposed to do on day one. That's a remarkable performance by both Pratt and Airbus and let me crystal clear we're extremely confident in the technology of the Geared Turbofan.", "On the commercial side, we continue to achieve key wins. At Otis, we won the Hudson Yards project in New York and the world's largest hotel the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. The climate controls and security, we secured the new Atlanta Braves Stadium in Georgia and the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre in Kuwait to name just a few.", "So overall, I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2015 and as we move forward, the priorities are largely the same that we laid out a year ago. First of all flawless execution, innovation to drive long-term growth, structural cost reduction and most importantly perhaps, disciplined to capital allocation. We remain focused on what we can control, which means controlling cost while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that will bring value to our customers over the long-term.", "So despite this mixed macro environment that we are all facing UTC is taking the actions necessary to drive long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth and create real long-term shareholder value.", "Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the quarterly and full-year results and I'll be back with a few closing comments in Q&A. Akhil.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Greg. So I'm on slide two. Adjusted EPS was $6.30 that\u2019s down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly excluding a $0.19 impacts from adverse foreign exchange. Full-year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included a restructuring charges of $0.31 and an additional $1.46 of net charges from other significant items.", "As we did told you back in December, a lot of moving pieces this quarter, so let me walk through a few of the larger pieces that make up the $1.46 of other significant items using the table on the right side of the page. This morning's press release tables have a more detailed reconciliation.", "The largest item is of $0.72 charge for the previously disclosed $867 million settlement of the Canadian royalty obligation at Pratt Canada. There were also $0.41 of charges for tax related items, roughly 75% of that is for U.S. taxes on the planned repatriation of $1.4 billion of cash related to foreign earnings. This will happen over the next couple of years.", "Our aerospace businesses recorded $0.27 of charges for customer contractual matters, $0.21 of that was at aerospace systems related to the completion of significant customer negotiations, including the enhancement of our contractual position on our key program, the settlement of certain customer contract disputes and a contract termination.", "At corporate, we recognized a liability of $0.17 for pending and future asbestos-related claims. This was based on an analysis of our claims history, broader nationwide asbestos claim data and most importantly recent agreements reached with insurers.", "On the other side of the ledger, you will recall in Q1 we had a gain on our value adjustment related to the acquisition of our controlling interest in a CCS joint venture that was a $0.14 benefit. Now net income for the year was reduced by these charges, resulting in fee cash flow to net income of 126%. In that number the benefit from net non-cash restructuring charges and other significant items was slightly more than 25 points.", "Moving to slide three, organic sales were up 1% for both the year and the quarter in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. Looking at the fourth quarter, our commercial businesses saw 4% growth in the Americas driven by continuing strong fundamentals in the U.S. Europe was down 2% primarily from continued pressure in the Otis service business and Asia was down 1% due to China where sales were down 4%.", "Growth in Commercial Aerospace was primarily driven by the aftermarket both at Pratt and UTAS. Military Aerospace sales were down 11% mainly due to tough prior year compared on engine deliveries at Pratt. Military aftermarket was down slightly at both Pratt and UTAS. I'm pleased to say that Pratt has resolved the supply chain and delays experience in Q3 as the New England Logistics Center of NELC. They are back to their pre NELC engine delivery cadence and we're on scheduled with deliveries for large commercial engines and the Joint Strike Fighter as of year-end.", "Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide four and just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CSS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. Overall trends remain broadly consistent with our expectations across the portfolio. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, the North America new equipment orders were up over 50% in the quarter and 30% for the year. This is on top of 40% growth in 2014, so very encouraging trend here.", "At CCS, U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was down 5% in the quarter, driven mainly by a slowing export market and tough compares in unitary. For the full-year, orders were up 5%. U.S. residential HVAC sales were up 2% in the quarter and up 5% for the full-year. EMEA was somewhat mixed in the quarter, Otis new equipment orders was strong up 20%.", "At CCS commercial HVAC equipment orders were also up 4%, while fire and security product orders were down 7%. In China, Otis new equipment orders were down 14% in the fourth quarter and finished down 13% for the full-year. On the other hand, CCS Fire and Security orders in China were up 8% and commercial HVAC was flat an improvement compared to trends earlier in the year.", "Moving to aerospace, revenue passenger miles continues to grow slightly above the long-term trend rate and airline profitability remains strong. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter, including a three points benefit from sale of Legacy Engine Hardware. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% on strong repair and provisioning activity.", "Now before, I let Paul to take you through the additional details for our 2015, let's talk briefly about the first quarter of 2016. Based on our expectation of slowly improving economies as the year progresses and easier comparison to second half, we expect 2016 to be backend loaded. Additionally, the second half of 2016 will benefit from declining E&D trends and higher cost savings.", "Also, recall the first quarter of 2015 benefited by about $0.10 from timing of a few exceptional items. First quarter last year was also the highest organic growth quarter of the year for CCS and UTAS. We had a slowing but still growing China for Otis and lower negative engine margins at Pratt.", "Primarily due to these factors as compared to an adjusted EPS of a $1.44 in Q1 2015 and consistent with our plan, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 for the first quarter of 2016. This includes about $0.08 to $0.10 benefits from lower share count and another $0.10 in pension [pay rate] (ph). As Greg said, we remain fully confident in our full-year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60.", "With that let me hand it off to Paul to walk you through the business units in detail. Paul.", "Paul Lundstrom", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. So turning to Otis on slide five, in the quarter sales were $3.1 billion, up 1% at constant currency. Otis profit was $561 million and down 13% also at constant currency, reflecting increased pricing pressure, principally from China and the margin impact from softer service sales in Europe and lower new equipment volume in China. Foreign exchange translation was an eight point headwind to sales and earnings. Otis also had headwind from foreign currency related mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter.", "New equipment sales increased 1%, led by 26% growth in North America and mid single-digit growth in Asia outside of China. EMEA new equipment sales were up 1%, while China was down 7%. Service sales for Otis were flat overall, as a mid single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was offset by 5% decline in EMEA.", "New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter. The strong momentum in North America continued, with orders up over 50% on continued strength in major projects. In EMEA, new equipment orders were up 20% with strong growth in most major markets, excluding Russia. New equipment orders in China were down 14% that's 8% on a unit basis, while new equipment orders in the rest of Asia were up 15% excluding the impact of the Thomson Line Metro project in Singapore that we referenced last year.", "For the full-year, operating profit was down 3% at constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Foreign exchange translation for the year had a nine point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit. New equipment orders finished up 4% with solid growth in North America and in EMEA partially offset by 10% decline in Asia driven by that 13% decline we saw in China. Outside of China, Otis global new equipment orders were up 17%.", "Moving to slide six, climate controls and security grew sales 3% at constant currency with three points of tailwind from net acquisitions and flat sales organically. Profits were up 5% at constant currency with continued benefits from restructuring and other productivity. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a five point headwind to both sales and earnings.", "During the quarter, we saw a continued sales growth in HVAC in North America where commercial HVAC was up 9%. EMEA saw growth in HVAC as well up 4% organically and Asia was down 7% driven by a lower China. Overall, sales growth in HVAC was partially offset by 2% declines in both the fire and security product and fuel businesses globally. The fire and security business in China was up 9%.", "Our global refrigeration business was flat in the quarter with mid-single digit growth in Transicold offset by mid single-digit declines in commercial refrigeration. CCS equipment orders were down 5% in the quarter primarily driven by last year's tough compare Transicold. If you recall last year, Transicold saw orders up more than 50% in the quarter.", "In the fire and security business, we were down mid single-digit globally with pressure from the oil and gas sector. For the full-year, operating profit was up 7% at constant currency driven by drop through from the 3% organic sales growth and productivity including lower commodity cost.", "Shifting to aerospace on slide seven, Pratt & Whitney's sales of $4 billion were flat organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales grew 11% in the quarter supported by low-teens growth in the commercial engines business, primarily from the V2500 up 26% in the quarter and approximately $60 million from a sale of legacy engine hardware. Military sales were down 15% on lower engine deliveries and large commercial OE sales were also down 15% primarily on engine mix as Pratt shift more V2500 engines and fewer PW4000 than in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Operating profit was down 1% in the quarter. Headwinds from lower military volume along with higher negative engine margin and pension headwind were largely offset by drop through from the stronger commercial aftermarket, continued declines in E&D spending and better warranty experience.", "For the full-year Pratt sales were down 1% organically driven by lower engine deliveries in all segments and lower military aftermarket sales. Commercial aftermarket growth was 6% for the year. Operating profit was down a $150 million in 2015. Headwinds from pension, negative engine margin and lower military aftermarket were partially offset by margin from the commercial aftermarket and lower E&D spending.", "Turning to slide eight. Aerospace systems sales were up 4% organically in the quarter, consistent with the last three quarters sales included the benefits of a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass through sales with no margins. Excluding those pass through sales the commercial OE business was up 2% in the quarter with growth in new platforms partially offset by declines in legacy.", "Commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% organically in the quarter, largely driven by growth in provisioning for the A320neo and the 787. Overall, commercial spares finished the year with a book-to-bill of [1.0] (Ph). Military OE were down high single-digit in the quarter driven by declines in the C17 and other programs and the military aftermarket was down as well about 1%.", "Aerospace systems profits were down 10% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE sales mix as we began transitioning to newer platforms, higher pension expense and lower contribution from licensing activities. These headwinds were partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and continued cost reduction. Engineering spending was essentially flat in the quarter.", "For the full-year, aerospace systems sales grew 3% organically with about two points of benefit from the pass through sales mention before. Profits for aerospace systems were down 3% for the year driven by adverse OE mix, lower military sales and higher pension expense partially offset by a continued benefits from productivity, lower engineering expense, income from licensing agreements and benefits from both higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable aftermarket contract adjustments.", "So with that let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks, Paul. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call. I am encouraged by the progress that team is making. With the actions we've taken we\u2019re much better positioned for the future. There is off course some uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment. You can think about the three biggest markets for UTX starting with the U.S. I think is a relatively solid outlook for U.S. GDP growth, despite what we've seen in the equity markets in January.", "China as you know is working through some structural challenges and in Europe we\u2019re starting to see signs of the recovery continues apace. Against this backdrop, we see continued growth in our North American markets and we expect that Europe will continue to slowly improve based on the order rates and the backlog as we exit the year.", "China will be down for 2016 but let\u2019s keep China in perspective, while certainly experiencing some challenges as it grapples with reform and rebounds its economy from an industrial growth story to a consumer consumption economy, its long-term growth prospects remain strong. We still expect to see a 100 million people urbanize in the next five years or so in China. And by 2025 they are forecast to be 221 million cities in China with more than 1 million inhabitants.", "Just to put that in perspective, today, in Europe there are 35 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants, so urbanization will continue to be a powerful force and it will drive growth in our commercial and aerospace businesses going forward. On the aerospace side, RPMs are continuing to grow, we saw that last year with more than 7% RPM growth and the airlines are making - and the backlogs are there. Right now for UTC it's about program execution and program cost.", "Again, we continue to be confident in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance as $6.30 to $6.60 on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion. Given the portfolio of the team we have today, I have never been more confident about the future of UTC. Our long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products and industry leading franchises, global scale and solid market fundamentals in our core businesses, driven by revenue passenger mile growth of the global expansion and continued urbanization of the middle-class have positioned UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future and all of this will create long-term shareowner value.", "It's important to remember in today's turbulent environment that UTC designs and manufactures products that people rely on every single day. Our products enable modern and are installed and service for decades regardless of the economic cycle. Our balance between aerospace and commercial, our balance between new equipment and service and our balance geographically will help us weather these uncertain times.", "Before we wrap it up today, just a word on the transition with Pratt. I would like to first of all take a minute to welcome Bob Leduc back to UTC. You will recall Bob is the new President of Pratt & Whitney following the announcement of Paul Adams retirement earlier in this month. And you know, Bob most recently led Sikorsky and Bob's leadership was instrumental in the successful sale of that business last year. I would also like to thank Paul Adams for his many contributions to the company and his tireless work over the last six years in bringing all of these engines to the marketplace. We wish Paul really nothing but success in the future.", "With that let\u2019s go ahead and open up the call for questions. Kailey.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell", "Hi, thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good Morning Julian.", "Julian Mitchell", "Good morning. Just a question first on the organic sales trends, so should we expect organic sales overall to be down a few points in Q1 and then sort of stabling Q2 and then kind of low mid single-digit in the back half to get to that one to three guides for the year.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, I think it's probably going to be more in the 0% to 1% range in the first quarter, it's not back here to be negative. I think there were some tough compares, but close to 0% to 1% I would say, and then slowly improving as the year progresses.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "You got to keep in mind Julian, we still see despite when we saw in China for Otis, new equipment orders continue to be up globally and I would think that backlog will continue to play out, so we have a very solid year outside of China and Europe is recovering. So again, it's not all doom and gloom here.", "Julian Mitchell", "Sure. And then on Otis secondly, a tough margin performance in Q4. You guided in December, I think for about a $215 million price mix headwind this year. Just wanted to check how confident you feel in that guidance now and maybe explain a little bit when you think we should start to see some of those market share improvement to show up in orders or revenues", "Akhil Johri", "So I think the pricing pressure is continuing to be there, to the point you made. We did see increased pricing pressure in China this quarter and the Europe service business has not seen much improvement in its pricing environment as of now. On the other hand, there is additional cost improvement that Otis is continuing to push for a part of the commodity tailwind that we are seeing will also help improve the Otis tailwind from the cost side.", "Remember they have 40,000 service vehicles, so the lower GAAP lean prices are the better it is from our service cost point of view. So we continue to look at cost to offset the incremental pricing pressure, but net-net pricing is probably slightly higher than what we're thinking in December.", "Now, with regard to margins for the current quarter, Julian keep in mind, we took this a significant mark-to-market FX hit in the quarter, which impacted margins by nearly a 100 basis point which is not normal for Otis. So if you adjust for that Q4 margins were not that far out of line versus our 2016 guidance.", "Julian Mitchell", "Great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Julian.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much. Just to talk about GTF, I realize it's quite an accomplishment Greg, but there is a enormous industrialization challenge and we've clearly gotten some indications from Airbus that it's going to be go slow before you go fast. So could you articulate how you are going to move forward with the engine so that the customer acceptance is flawless.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Howard it's a great question. And as I mentioned many times over the past year, the single biggest challenge that UTC has is the ramp on the GTF and coming down the cost curve on the GTF so that we can actually improve overall performance at Pratt. You are exactly right, there is going to be a relatively slow ramp in the first half of the year, no change to the full-year.", "However, we still express to deliver about 200 GTF engines, most of those off course will go to Airbus, there will be some going to Bombardier for the CSeries aircraft, but I think again we are following the lead of the Airbus on this. But we think this is the prudent thing in terms of ramping up production relatively slowly entering into service and we want to have flawless entry into service across all of the airline customers and this gives us the opportunity to ensure. I think that's what exactly happens.", "So far it's been wonderful with Lufthansa this week, since we've put the engine into service and we expect that trend to continue. The engine is in great shape technically and we will focus to get on supply chain execution throughout the year. I think Bob Leduc will hit the ground running there, he has spent a lot of time in his first week on the job focused on this and this is going to be the gain for Pratt this year.", "Howard Rubel", "But just a follow-up, you wouldn\u2019t have made this management change if execution weren\u2019t part of the issue and so how do we think about the P&L impact and also the ramp in 2017 is stunningly high and probably not achievable the way you have laid it out. So I mean are we going to see a restructuring of some from, because you are not going to get there, I think under the old plan?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Howard did you get cranky this morning, forgot your coffee, I think you are supposed to.", "Howard Rubel", "No but in all seriousness Greg I mean you have a remarkable optimism, but I want you to plan for the downside so that we can see something that's a little bit better, but that hill is huge.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Howard I couldn\u2019t agree with you more, it is a huge hill to climb. Let me first of all just go back to your first comment. Paul's retirement was sudden, it wasn\u2019t expected, but you got to give Paul credit. He is the guy that shepherded this engine through the design, through the development, through the certification and working nonstop for the last six years, you understand why Paul wanted to take a pause.", "We are really fortunate to have Bob Leduc on the bench with the sale of course to hit the ground running over there and Bob knows the business, he was at Pratt for more than 30 years, he has been at UTC for more than 35 years. He knows what needs to be done from a ramp perspective on the operation side and the team is focused on it.", "I think again, this slow entry into service that we've laid out with Airbus gives us the chance to make sure the supply chain is in sync with our manufacturing facilities. Let's say Howard with all of the money that we have spent on capital and infrastructure within the UTC operations, I'm confident we can hit this run rate going forward. These engines don\u2019t take long to assemble, it's the question of just making sure all parts are there on time and that's what the focus is going to be at Pratt as well as driving the cost down.", "So just because Bob is coming in there is no change to Pratt's guidance, let me be clear on that. There is no change to the ramp schedule. 2017 is 12 months away I'm not going to give guidance on 2017, but we remain confident along with Airbus that we will be able to meet their requirements going into the next couple of years.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Howard.", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hey Carter.", "Carter Copeland", "Question for Akhil actually. Akhil I wondered if you could give us a little bit more granularity on Q1 at the segment level, it's sounded like you were highlighting more of the revenue growth challenge against tough comparison CCS and UTAS. Obviously we know about the margin pressure at Pratt, presumably those early deliveries have a very negative engine margin, not just the sort of averages that you guys talk about, but you also called out negative mix impacts on UTAS on the OEM front. I was just wondering if you could just help us a little bit more at the segment level and understanding those trends and how we work through the year. I know you talked about E&D tailwind as well, where will we see those primarily Pratt any extra color would be helpful?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure. So I think trends unfortunately as you know at the segment levels 2016 is a year where only CCS is talking about a growth in earnings. So challenge that first quarter is a little more pronounced in the case of UTAS in the case of Pratt and in the case of Otis where they will recover as the year progresses, but the first quarter is going to be more than disproportionately down in earnings as those segments ready to bear full-year guidance right. It's the mix at UTAS that you talked about Carter, it\u2019s the continuing pricing challenge at Otis and the lack of service recovery yet in Europe. CCS continues to do well, although that has a tough compare in the first quarter based on just the strong organic growth they had, 5% organic growth last year.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, 6%.", "Akhil Johri", "6%, so I think as a result CCS will have a little bit of a challenge. The good news will come as I said on the pension side which will flow through all of the segments and then the share count reductions which is the effective capital deployment that we have been doing. So, again no surprises here Carter, I don't want to let anybody feel that this is new news, this is something we knew all along when we put the plan and our guidance together, it is just a way the structure of the year is.", "Carter Copeland", "Yes. So, just trying to get the cadence right. So, effectively Q1 will mark the low point for all four segments", "Akhil Johri", "Yes.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Carter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.", "David Strauss", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning David.", "David Strauss", "Greg on the GTF, there was the comment and the release today about hitting our key performance requirements, but can you just update us on the cooling issue where that stands getting a fix there?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, David. We continue to make progress there. I think we talked about this in detail in December. I would tell you that Pratt team has identified the fixes is a software fix and a minor hardware fix. Just to be clear, every next generation commercial engine out there has to cool down to a uniform thermal before they start the engine. So this is not something endemic just to the GTF, the starting time of the cooling is a little longer than what's the customer would have liked.", "These changes that we're talking about on software and the hardware, again relatively simple to do not a big cost and I think importantly doesn't change any of the fuel burn or noise or emissions on the engine, these are really pretty minor changes. If you guys are looking for something to worry about, we worry about thing we don't control like FX. I wouldn't worry about the technical aspects of this GTF, it is rock solid.", "David Strauss", "Greg, when would you expect the fix to be in the market?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We expect - the hardware comes in for the changes in our February build, we'll get those out by towards the end of the second quarter, you will actually see those out there in deliveries.", "David Strauss", "Okay, great.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Just given the slow ramp, it's actually beneficial, there is not going to be a lot of engines out there with the old hardware or we will retrofit those over the course of the next year. So again, we expect the impact to customers to be very minimal.", "David Strauss", "Okay and a follow-up on the aftermarket, pretty good numbers this quarter both at Pratt and UTAS. How are you feeling relative to the forecast you have given for 2016, I think pretty much flat the low single-digit growth, do you think maybe there could be upside or how do you feel overall? Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Look we're very encouraged by what we saw at the fourth quarter, we've been talking about aftermarket growth, RPMs were up as I said 7%, we expect them to be up at least 5%, 5.5% this year. Airline profitability remains very, very strong. So we expect the guidance that we gave, clearly we have a very good shot at that and if there is up side, we will talk about that at the end of the year as appose to the beginning of the year.", "David Strauss", "Okay. That works, thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Ronald Epstein", "Hey good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hey Ron.", "Akhil Johri", "Good Morning Ron.", "Ronald Epstein", "So a big picture question for you. I think, I have been covering you guys almost 15 years and you have been doing restructuring for 15 years. When do we finally see a return on all these restructuring, it's like billions a year, like when does that happen?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So Ron, we've been doing restructuring - I have been here 26 years and I think every year we have done restructuring amongst those 26 years. The fact is we seem to pay off all the time. As I think about the latest big trench of restructuring is 2009 to 2014, we did about $3 billion of restructuring, you saw a big pay off from that restructuring. In fact almost $3 billion of run rate savings.", "We'll continue to see savings on this next trench of restructuring, it\u2019s about $1.5 billion over four years in 2015 through 2018. By 2019 you should see about $900 million of run rate savings. The fact of the matter is you got to keep doing this. The DNA of UTC is to take cost out to do more with less, it's about productivity every day, because the world just get more competitive, had we not done restructuring in the past, we wouldn't be where we are today in terms of product cost and global scale. So it's real, it's necessary and it's things that we know how to do.", "Akhil Johri", "It\u2019s also Ron, since you are talking big picture as step back, so on a big picture basis and remind you of the operating margin that UTC had in mid \u201890s, when we started doing restructuring, it was 6% and it is 16.7% now. And lot of that margin expansion has been fueled by this continuous restructuring that we do taking cost out.", "I would also put our SG&A rate against any industrial company and you will see that our aerospace companies are best-in-class in terms of SG&A as a percent of sales, as are our commercial companies. So all that has been fueled where we need to continue to work on, its reducing our manufacturing footprint, as Greg talked about in December, where we have 42 million square feet of which 22 million are certain high cost locations and we need to continue to work on that. So productivity is a way of life at UTC, as Greg said, it is part of the DNA and we just need to keep building that.", "Ronald Epstein", "Okay and then just one quick detail. That $900 million to the Canadian government, is that the Bombardier tax, I mean can you give us more color, what is that?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Go ahead.", "Akhil Johri", "Look, we over the last several years, we've had these agreements, multiple agreements with the Canadian government on to which they would provide reimbursement for portion of our E&D. we had intern promised certain jobs in Canada and certain supply chain related investments and in return we had to pay royalties for several years. So where we stood at the end of last year was we had 20 years plus off variable high royalty payments looking ahead for us and all we did was crystallize that liability into a certain payment at this point of time, which we will pay off in four years. Net-net it's good news for both the Canadian government and for us, we essentially given back the E&D funding that they had given to us we've also taken advantage of a good exchange rate in the process. Canadian dollar is at a pretty decent rate right now and so I think net-net it's a pretty good thing to do.", "Ronald Epstein", "Okay that make sense right. Thanks guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Cai Von Rumohr", "Yes, thank you very much. So I joined a little bit late, but maybe tell us how many GTFs you delivered in the fourth quarter and you have mentioned that supplier issues kind of our potential bottleneck. Where are you on that and are there any other kind of potential kind of restraints beyond the cooling issue? Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, Cai. I think the total deliveries on GTF in the fourth quarter were only five and keep in mind that goes to 200 this year. As I think about the technical aspect of the engine as I said before, this cooling issue has really prove to be a non-issue, we've got that issue behind us I believe. And as far as the rest of the engine goes, so far it's been rock solid.", "Its 15% better on fuel burn, it's 15% better on emissions, it's 75% better on noise when the engine is replacing. And it's been proven in both the development program and the flight test to meet all of those criteria and I think you are going to see airlines lining up to get this, we've got orders for more than 7,000 of these engines keep in mind.", "As far as the supply chain, I think it's all of the normal challenges that you have in any ramp up. Again, we are ramping down to V2500, we are ramping up to GTF. There are 500 suppliers on this engine, the fact is there is probably five or 10 that cause us concern on a daily basis. Leduc and the team at Pratt are working all of those issues on a daily basis, we did put a lot of resources in the supply chain.", "So there is no one supplier I would call out here other to say that we are on top of all of those suppliers making sure that they meet their commits. Keep in mind that 80% of this engine comes from the supply chain, so supply chain has to be perfectly synchronized with the build plan and that's what we are working to ensure.", "Cai Von Rumohr", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Cai.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning, gents.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning Mr. Sprague.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Good morning. Maybe shifting gears a little bit to the commercial companies. Just couldn\u2019t keep up with all the color on CCS, you then clear had made a comment about commercial orders down, does that include Transicold in that commentary. Could you just speak to the actual commercial HVAC end market and what you are seeing there in the quarter and sales and orders?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. Sure, Jeff. So we talked about CCS equipment orders in the quarter being down 5% that was largely driven by declines in Transicold, which if you recall last year we talked about Transicold orders being up more than 50%. So some of that\u2019s compare, if you look at sort of across some of the other product lines, global commercial HVAC was down about 2% driven by a softer North America and both the fire and security products business and the fuel businesses were down a little bit as well. I guess one bright spot on the fire and security side was that China was actually up in the quarter about 8% and that was driven by our fire detection and alarm business in Qinhuangdao that's the GST business which saw better order rates coming out of their the commercial vertical.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "And the comment about weakness in U.S. export related was that also a Transicold comment or is this something else?", "Akhil Johri", "It was commercial, it has largely to do but some of the projects in the Middle East if you will on the export side where we are seeing some weakness commercial.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Commercial HVAC.", "Akhil Johri", "Commercial HVAC.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Right and then maybe just shifting gears. So you decided to take a charge and bite the board on repatriation. Do you see more of that as we move forward or you just kind of - is that's got a one time opportunity you are taking given the given the gain on Sikorsky and other dynamics in the quarter.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We were trying to be opportunistic, I think it will bring back about a $1.4 billion for as a result of net charge. I think the effective tax rate on that's about 17% so we thought it made sense to do that given what we're trying to do here in terms of another $3 billion of share buyback and $2 billion cost of dividends. It just seem to be the most advantageous way to get at that cash. There are no further plans to take charges like that. We bring back $500 million to $1 billion a year anyways when we receive that typically relatively low text cost, but this is just kind of a one-time item and it probably won't be repeating in the future or the near future at least.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "And if I could just sneak one more in, can you give a little bit more color, though the end markets overall seem to be getting a little bit better, do you still think that traditional lag effect will kick in, that better turnaround equipment will see that into service or is there some other dynamic there?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes you are exactly right Jeff. I think if you look at what mix the service revenue go up, it's essentially conversion of new equipment coming out of warrantee into service contract and that has been anemic in Europe as you know. The fact that new equipment orders are starting to be up, new equipments sales in EMEA was up in the fourth quarter as well, those will translate into service contracts for the down the line.", "The other aspect is also that the modernization side of the service business had been hurt significantly as some of these regulations have worked itself out primarily in France. And I think we've hit bottom their modernization backlog is actually up so that should start to turnaround as well. So the combination of new equipment sales turning into service contracts and modernization improving should start to turn that but it is going to be a slow process as you said Jeff, it's not going to turn right away.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes Jeff, just to put a couple of data points around that. We talked about Europe, new equipment orders or EMEA new equipment orders being up 20%. They are also up better than 20% for the year including Western Europe which was also up double-digit. so that's encouraging and then to Akhil's point on the mod side, if you look at the end of 2014, we've finished the year with mod backlog down in the teens. It was essentially flat in 2015, we would rather see up, but it certainly a better starting point, going into 2016 than what we saw last year", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Alright. Thank you for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.", "Jason Gursky", "Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the call here. Just going back to China on the commercial businesses and the comment that you made that there was a bit of disconnect between HVAC and fire and security orders relative to Otis. Can you just provide a little bit more color on why that disconnect is developed and let us know why we think one is a leading indicator over the other. Meaning HVAC in fire and security begin to follow Otis or are we going to begin to see a reversal of Otis and see some better things to come more in line with what we've got at HVAC and fire and security?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Jason, as you think about Otis in China, 60% plus of the Otis business relates to residential construction and that of course is the mark that has been the most hurt by I would say the over building and there maybe some of the over leverage that we've seen in the Chinese economy in the last five or six years. So it\u2019s not surprising to see the Otis orders now a lot more than the rest of the business.", "On the commercial and industrial side you see again orders were flattish on our commercial HVAC business. Actually what we see in the overall economy industrial economy, there is not much growth, it is not declining the same way the residential space is. I mean if you look at the fire products that is really more of a consumer driven purchase as appose to residential construction or even industrial and that was up 8%.", "So as China make this transition from this industrial economy to this consumer economy, we can expect to see more of the trends continue, but urbanization is not done as I said, you still got a huge population of people move into the cities. We are not giving up on the residential elevator market. We still see growth there, we see a lot more growth I think on the service side, Otis is a service business, I think we were servicing a 165,000 elevators at the end of the year that\u2019s about 20%, we expect another 20% kind of growth as we go into 2016. So the dynamics are not unexplained, well I think you just need to peel it back away or understand individual dynamics of the businesses.", "Jason Gursky", "That's helpful. Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning Nigel.", "Nigel Coe", "We covered lot of ground. So just wanted a couple of quick questions here. So going back to the $1.5 billion charges in the quarter, is that all cash and then I guess on the Canadian R&D reimbursements, does that help future indications for margin, it feels like there is a royalty payment that goes away in the future years.", "Akhil Johri", "Sure, the second question is first Nigel. The Canadian royalty trade off would probably be at $30 million benefit in 2016 but it will result in about a $100 million EBIT benefit for five years out, when the E&D reimbursements was expected to be there, which are going away now and the royalty payments go away as well. So definitely benefit to Pratt four, five years out of about $100 million or so a years.", "With regard to overall, the cash charges and lot of these payments - the Canadian payment which is the largest one of the $1.5 billion charge that you referred to is cash. In 2016 we would probably have $500 million cash outflow as a result of these charges that we have taken in Q4 of this year, roughly $250 million or so from Canada and another $250 or so for the tax related cash reparation if you will, right. So that's the impact, the rest of it will follow over the course of the next few years.", "Nigel Coe", "Okay that's very helpful and then just quickly on CCS and I know this question have been answered a few times but the downsides in orders, do you have the backlog number in hand, how does the backlog look year-to-year?", "Akhil Johri", "The backlog, we can get you the exact number later on, but I do believe that backlog was - because of full-year was up for commercial HVAC and the sales were up slightly more. So backlog maybe slightly down is what I'm guessing, but we'll get you the exact number.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I don't have the number handy but I would just remind you that on CSS it's a relatively quick turn - not relatively, very quick turn. So on the HVAC side you know you are going to turn orders in a few weeks up to as high and maybe three months and on the fire and security side it's essentially a book and ship business. So I would say backlog is a lot more important than Otis side than CCS.", "Nigel Coe", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Nigel.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Your line is open.", "Deane Dray", "Thank you. Good morning everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning Deane.", "Deane Dray", "Hey I was hoping you could comment on whether you see any changes in how UTC is competitively positioned with this announced JCI and Tyco merger and commercial building services. We talked about potential consolidation, so this is a big one is here. Does that change the equation for you guys at all?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Not very much Deane, as I think Tyco\u2019s fire business if you think about it is primarily a fuel business, it's about 75% fuel, 25% product, we obviously compete against them in both for fuels and the product. We are actually more heavily weighed into the product side than the fuel side and as far as JCI goes on their building efficiency side obviously we compete with them against with carrier.", "But again, they will take some cost out as I think you saw in their press release just similar to what is [Indiscernible] when we put fire and security and carrier together about three years ago. So it\u2019s nice to do the run in our playbook there, but I don\u2019t really see that there is a big competitive impact as a result of that.", "Deane Dray", "Thanks. And then just a question for Akhil on the asbestos charge. How far out have you reserved the asbestos liability and have there been any changes or material changes in your insurance coverage?", "Akhil Johri", "As I said earlier, I think we've had looked at the potential from all the knowledge we have today of the pending and future expected claims and adjusted that downward for the insurance agreements that we entered into in Q4. So net of those two is what you are seeing here, hopefully we won't see any greater charges beyond this, but you never know right, but at this point based on the best knowledge we had Deane we took that into account.", "Deane Dray", "So just to clarify on the time horizon, we've seen companies take different approaches here. Did you take what's called an end of life charge which is as far as you can foresee, it sounds like that's in your answer or did you do a 10 year reserve.", "Akhil Johri", "No. It's end of life is what the approach we took at.", "Deane Dray", "That's great to hear. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning Sam.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Can you talk a little bit about Pratt & Whitney, it looks like when you talked I guess before you talked about I think it was $15 billion in revenues, it looks like it came in a little bit less even on an adjusted basis just with that military weakness. Why is it a little bit light in the fourth quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Sam, you are exactly right. If you think about the revenues in Q4, Pratt was a little short of our expectations even from December while we hit on the earnings side, we were a little short. We were 100% on contract at Pratt as we exited the year both on the commercial and the military side, but we had expected to get the more engines out of the door on the military side than what actually shipped. So there was a little bit of I'll say backlog there that we had expected to get out.", "Akhil Johri", "The other one Sam there is the Pratt Canada business, as you know the helicopter related engine shipments have been weak throughout the year, there has been also some weakness in the general aviation market particularly related to engines for the agricultural segment et cetera. So I think Pratt Canada and military engines those were the two short falls versus say a few months ago.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "And then just on Otis, can you just talk a bit about sequentially from the third quarter to fourth quarter, there is over a 200 basis points shrink in the margin on an adjusted basis. Is that foreign exchange that the R&D step up you have talked about, I mean what is the type.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes Sam, it's largely due to the foreign exchange, because as you recall Q3 actually had a positive roughly $30 million benefit from mark-to-market adjustments and that almost entirely reserved in Q4. So if you adjust for those things I think the adjusted margins are not that far off quarter-to-quarter.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Hayes for closing remarks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thank you Kailey. First of all, thanks for listening in today, I appreciate, I know there is a lot of data here and Paul and the team will be available throughout the day and the week to take all of your questions. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Investor Meeting, we will be doing that in New York on March 10th. Again, if you have any questions give us a call.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet. And there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com.", "Please note except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations and excluding restructuring costs and significant other items of non-recurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as significant other items.

You may ask further questions by re-inserting yourself into the queue as time permits. Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thank you, Kali, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. These better than expected results were against a difficult prior year compare and reflect solid operational performance. So we're off to a good start.", "And as a result, we remain very confident in our 2016 guidance with top line organic growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $6.30 to $6.60.", "Importantly, we also continue to make progress on the key strategic priorities we laid out at our December and March investor meeting. And you can see these on Slide 1.", "First priority, as always, flawless execution. Beyond better than expected Q1 results were truly a team effort. Pratt [& Whitney] is ramping up production as planned. Our Middletown, Connecticut, and West Palm Beach engine centers had the strongest Q1 output we've seen in over a decade. That includes both commercial and military engines. At our Climate, Controls & Security business they drove another 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.", "The Aerospace Systems team, they completed a major ERP implementation, while continuing to meet program and customer milestones.", "And importantly, Otis delivered a solid 3% organic sales growth in the quarter, despite China sales being down 3%. Also new equipment orders for Otis in China grew 2% year over year on a units basis, something we haven't seen since the end of 2014.", "On the innovation front there are now five A320s in revenue service, all powered by the Geared Turbofan engine. And they're providing our customers with better than expected performance. The dispatch reliability across the in-service fleet is over 99%. That's great news for the airline and bodes well for the future of the program.", "And at Carrier Transicold we recently delivered the world's first naturally refrigerated truck/trailer that operates exclusively with the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2, yet another example of our commitment to and investment in sustainable technologies.", "On cost reduction, that's a way of life here at UTC. Look at our SG&A in the quarter, down year over year both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. UTC's SG&A is now at 10%, which is best in class versus the peer group.", "And as always we're disciplined on capital allocation. As you saw earlier this week, we raised our dividend for the 13th time since 2001, representing a 12.5% cumulative average growth rate over the last 15 years. We're proud of that record, having paid cash dividends for 80 consecutive years.", "We're also executing on the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, or ASR, that was launched late last year. On top of that we expect to do another $3 billion in share repurchases this year. We're going to continue to drive our share repurchase program as long as there is a significant disconnect between our view of the intrinsic value of UTC and our share price. And we continue to expect to return at least $22 billion to shareowners from 2015 to 2017.", "As always we remain focused on what we can control. And this means driving productivity, while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that bring value to the customers. And this focus will drive sustainable long-term growth and of course increase shareowner value.", "Across the business we continue to achieve significant program milestones and secure key wins that position the portfolio well. At Pratt as I mentioned earlier, the GTF is doing well on the neo. And the C-series is on track for entry into service in the middle of the year.", "On the military side we're honored to have been selected to supply the engine on the new B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber. And together with the JSF, this positions Pratt well on key DoD programs for decades to come.", "As you know we have strong content on new programs in our Aerospace Systems businesses as well. And these innovative products should deliver nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 25 years between Pratt and Aerospace Systems.", "Innovation is also driving growth in our commercial businesses. Climate, Controls & Security recently launched its Onity DirectKey system for mobile access at Hilton Worldwide. This is a cloud-based technology that allows for a straight-to-the-room option for hotel guests with their smartphone.", "On the Otis side in the quarter we installed the world's largest double-deck elevator at the Lotte World Tower, Korea's tallest building, and announced that we'll put elevators and escalators in the Aurora Melbourne Center (sic) [Central] in Australia, which will be the tallest residential building in Melbourne.", "This is just a few examples of many of where our investments in innovations are starting to pay off. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the first quarter results. And I'll be back with just a few closing comments before we start Q&A. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Greg. I'm on Slide 2. As Greg said, organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, in what continues to be a slow growth and challenging macro environment. Once again it looks like the U.S. economy grew at a slower than expected pace in the first quarter, leading to a downward revision of the full year GDP outlook and still relying on a stronger second half growth rate.", "However, for our commercial businesses the U.S. remains a bright spot. We saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven primarily by Otis, which was up 9%. North American commercial HVAC was up 4%, and residential was up 1%. You will recall that Q1 of 2015 benefited from above normal SEER 13 shipments. Excluding that impact, resi sales were up high single-digit in the quarter.", "Sales were down 2% in Europe and the Middle East, driven by CCS. Mid-to high single-digit declines in commercial HVAC, commercial refrigeration, and foreign security businesses unit of compares were only partially offset by a double-digit increase in truck/trailer refrigeration. And in a sign of stabilization, Otis sales were flat in the EMEA region.", "In China, Otis and commercial HVAC were both down 3%, slightly better than our expectations. We saw good growth across rest of Asia at both Otis and commercial HVAC, up 7% and 8% respectively, partially offset by declines in the refrigerated container business.", "Commercial Aerospace growth of 4% was primarily driven by Pratt, where the aftermarket was strong.", "On the military side, sales were flattish for both the OEM and the aftermarket. Production declines in programs such as the C-17 at UTAS and Pratt were offset by higher Joint Strike Fighter engine deliveries at Pratt.", "Let's look at our end markets on Slide 3. As always, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis. In our commercial businesses we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where new equipment orders were up 33% in the quarter, the 16th consecutive quarter of growth.", "At CCS, as I said before, residential HVAC sales were up slightly in the quarter, while orders for residential equipment were up 15%. Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 7% in the quarter, driven by lower exports. Domestic commercial equipment orders were flat.", "Orders in Europe and the Middle East were weak in the quarter, partly due to tough compares. Otis new equipment was down 13%, driven by primarily by Russia. At CCS, commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 10%.", "As you know, China reported Q1 GDP growth of 6.7%, the lowest rate of growth there since 2009. But recent indicators, including home prices, number of property transactions, and exports have been better than expected, showing some signs of economic stabilization.", "At Otis, China new equipment orders were down 7% in the first quarter in dollar terms, a little better than we had expected coming into the year. And at CCS, commercial HVAC was down 6%, and Fire & Security orders were down slightly.", "On the Aerospace side, consistent with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% at UTC Aerospace Systems. On the other hand, Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales grew 19% in the quarter, largely driven by timing of deliveries associated with strong Q4 2015 orders and some advanced purchases by customers.", "Now moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $13.4 billion were flat versus the prior year, as 2% organic growth was offset by 2 points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was up 2%. On a GAAP basis EPS was $1.42, which included $0.05 of restructuring charges.", "Free cash flow was 43% of net income and in line with our expectations. Cash flow was pressured by inventory build to support the Aerospace production ramp and included a payment of nearly $250 million related to the charge taken in Q4 2015 for the Canadian royalty settlement. This was the first of four annual payments. We continue to expect full-year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100% in 2016.", "As Greg said, we are confident in our full-year outlook: Sales of $56 billion to $58 billion, and adjusted EPS range of $6.30 to $6.60. With a solid first quarter under our belt and a weaker than expected U.S. dollar thus far, our contingency at $6.45, the midpoint of our range, is now up to $250 million, assuming the current FX rates hold for the rest of the year.", "With that, let me now hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail. Paul?", "Paul Lundstrom - VP, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. Turning to Otis on Slide 5. In the quarter sales were $2.7 billion, up 4% at constant currency and 3% organically. Otis profit was $481 million and down 5% at constant FX, reflecting continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, more than offsetting drop through from stronger volume in other areas. Foreign exchange translation was a 5-point headwind to sales and earnings.", "New equipment sales at Otis increased 6%, led by 21% growth in North America, 6% growth in EMEA, and mid-teens growth in Asia, outside of China. China new equipment sales were down 6% in the quarter.", "Otis service sales were up low single-digit overall, as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was partially offset by a 1% decline in EMEA.", "New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter. Orders in North America were up 33%, while in EMEA we saw new equipment orders down 13% on a tough prior year compare. Recall, orders in the first quarter of last year were up 37%. China orders were down 7% on a dollar basis, with 2% higher unit bookings. Outside of China, Asia was strong with orders up 11%. And for the year guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $75 million to $125 million of profit decline for Otis.", "Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security sales were flat in the quarter at constant currency, with 1 point of growth from acquisitions offset by a 1% organic sales decline in what will be the year's toughest quarterly compare. Profits were up 4% at constant currency with benefits from lower commodities and other productivity. Operating margins were up 70 basis points to 17%. FX at CCS was a 3-point headwind to both sales and profit.", "During the quarter we saw continued growth in HVAC sales with both North America residential and global commercial HVAC up 1%. Globally, the Fire & Security business was down 4% with a high single-digit decline in the global Fire Products business from tougher compares in EMEA and continuing weakness in the oil and gas sector.", "Transport refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter with a nearly 25% decline in the container business, offset by continuing growth in truck/trailer. Global refrigeration sales were down high single-digit.", "CCS equipment orders declined by 8% in the quarter. Transicold was down over 25% off a very strong first quarter last year. Globally, equipment orders at both the Fire & Security and the commercial HVAC businesses were down 7%. While orders were soft in Q1 at Climate, Controls & Security, with easier back-half compares and continued productivity, we are confident in the full-year profit growth of $175 million to $225 million at constant currency on low single-digit organic sales growth.", "Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.6 billion were up 8% organically in the quarter. This was driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, up 19%.", "Military engines were also up in the quarter with military OE sales up 16%, driven by higher JSF shipments, partially offset by the end of production for the C-17 engines.", "OEM sales were down 12% and 15% respectively at Pratt Canada and large commercial engines. Geared Turbofan shipments were exactly in line with what Bob Leduc laid out at the investor meeting in March.", "Pratt operating profit was $415 million, down $17 million or 4%. Pratt saw a $70 million headwind from commercial OE margins and another $50 million from adverse military margin mix, as we shipped more JSF engines and fewer of the fully learned out C-17 engines.", "As we expected E&D was also higher in the quarter. And we continue to expect a second half spending decline, as we approach entry into service for the C-series and engine certification milestones on the remaining Geared Turbofan programs.", "Partially offsetting these headwinds were drop through from the strong commercial aftermarket volume and both better pension and FX. Last year's favorable contract termination of $0.03 was offset by a contract settlement this quarter for a similar amount. For the full year we continue to be on track for operating profit to be flat to down $50 million.", "Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were down 1% organically in the quarter. Commercial OE sales were up 1% with continued growth on the A350 and initial production on the A320neo, partially offset by declines in legacy programs.", "In line with our expectations commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% with low single-digit growth in both parts and repair, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in provisioning.", "Overall military volumes were down in the quarter, with OE sales down more than 10%, driven by continued declines in the C-17 and other programs, while the military aftermarket was up slightly.", "Aerospace Systems delivered $551 million of profit, an 11% decline in the face of a tough compare versus the prior year, which benefited from favorable contract settlements and higher licensing activities.", "Unfavorable commercial mix, largely from the transition to next-generation platforms and the drop through from lower military sales, were significant headwinds in the quarter. These were partially offset by additional cost reduction actions and pension tailwind.", "For the year, based on expected improvements in organic growth and incremental savings from cost-reduction actions, we continue to expect operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.", "With that let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Paul. I hope you guys got all that. As I said at the beginning of the call, strong start to the year. We're delivering on our plan and delivering on our commitments. And I'm encouraged on the progress we're making on the strategic initiatives that we laid out back in March.", "As I also mentioned before, let's just talk about guidance for a second. We're confident in our full-year 2016 outlook. And as Akhil said, we've got a pretty significant contingency at the midpoint.", "So while Q1 was a good start to the year, it is still only April. A couple of things to think about. The macro environment remains uncertain. And like many others we expect a much stronger growth in the second half of 2016. And we're also continuing to watch the order rates at CCS, pricing at Otis in both Europe and China, and of course the aerospace aftermarket trend.", "So while we considered bringing up the bottom end of the range, I think it's prudent at this point just to leave the guidance range unchanged. You know what our contingency is. But also remember it's our practice that we'll continue to watch these trends. And we'll revisit this at the end of the second quarter. Okay?", "We also continue to believe UTC is well positioned for the long term. And that is ultimately our mission. We've got this focused portfolio of industry leading franchises. We've got innovative products in the pipeline. And we also have global scale and a lean cost structure. On top of that solid market fundamentals, which we've been talking about.", "And these trends are real. That's revenue passenger mile growth, continued urbanization, and the global expansion of the middle class. All of these together are going to position UTC to deliver strong earnings growth, not just this year, but well into the future. And of course translate into significant long-term shareowner value creation.", "So with that let me turn it back to Kali and open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just wondered if you could give us a little color on the order commentary in truck/trailer versus containers? I know you quoted the revenue, but just wondered if you could tell us how the orders are trending?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, Carter, the orders \u2013 as you know Transicold had a very, very strong orders quarter last year in Q1. It was up 24% organically with truck/trailer in North America up 73% last year.", "So on the back of those compares what we are seeing this year is down 24% in Q1 year over year on orders, with container down a little north of 20% and North America truck/trailer down a little north of 50%. Europe truck/trailer continued to be very strong with up double-digit order growth.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I wouldn't read too much into these quarterly order rates, either, Carter. You know this is a lumpy, lumpy business, both truck/trailer and container. Still feel confident in the full-year guidance. And we still have very, very good market share in both truck/trailer as well as the container business. So it's lumpy, but it's early. So I don't think there's any real cause of concern here.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Understood. And just as a quick follow-up on the provisioning you mentioned, the down low single digit. Just for clarification, do we lap the fall off in those provisioning sales beginning next quarter?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, there's going to be some improvement as you will expect through the rest of the year. I mean our guidance for the year is to be flat. Little bit of the weakness in the first quarter was also driven by some push out of Airbus 320neo deliveries, as you can imagine, because that caused some of the airlines to delay their uptake of provisioning. But we do expect full year to still be flat and compares to get easier as you pointed out.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And the fundamentals are good, right? You've got A320 deliveries picking up, and neos deliveries picking up. You've got A350 deliveries picking up. You've got C-series coming into service. I mean all of those things would point to a much stronger back half and to Akhil's point, much easier compares.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for the color, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Carter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, good morning, gents.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just maybe, Akhil, you provided a range in mid-March, $1.35 to $1.40 [adjusted EPS] as a placeholder for the quarter. It came in at $1.47. I hate to sort of be counting the pennies here, but what drove the upside? Did you see a better back half of March? Was it some shift on commercial OE? Can you maybe add some color to that upside?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, Nigel. I mean it's always good to be on the positive side of a beat, as opposed to the other.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Sure.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's \u2013 well, the reality is our execution was much better. I mean, as Greg said, UTAS was in the middle of implementing a huge ERP implementation. And we were just a little concerned whether we would be able to catch up with the impact of that. And as Greg said, the team did a fabulous job of making sure we met customer commitments and were able to get past the SAP implementation and still deliver on our commitments. And so that was a better \u2013 slightly better performance at UTAS versus what our internal expectations were.", "Pratt executed extremely well. The production output was the best ever for a Q1. Again we had a little contingency against that. And then Otis environment \u2013 from a macro point of view Otis came in better both in China and in North America than we had expected.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's really helpful, Akhil. And a quick follow on. Greg, maybe, there's a lot of \u2013 obviously a lot of news and noise about the GTF technical fix. Maybe just bring us up to speed on how that's looking right here?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think it's all really good news, Nigel. As we look at it today, as I mentioned, we're at 99% plus dispatch reliability. I think importantly, if you talk to the airlines, you talk to Lufthansa, you talk to IndiGo, they are seeing better than the 16% fuel burn that we had been committing to, something like 18% better fuel burn.", "So the engines are performing better than expectations. We had a software drop last quarter or last \u2013 yeah, last month. Reduced the nuisance faults in the cockpit by about 80%. All of the other fixes that we've talked about are going to be in production by June.", "And the whole fleet- the few engines that we do deliver in the first half will be retrofitted by year end. So everybody feels good about the program on the neo. And I think it would be the same across all of the GTF platforms, at Embraer, at Bombardier, at MRJ. This is a great engine.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Jason.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Jason.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, Akhil, I was wondering if you could give us a quick update on your cost structure initiatives? They on track? Both from a timing and financial impact perspective? And maybe some quick comments on whether the political climate today is making things maybe a bit more difficult? Or giving you pause on any of your plans at this point?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jason, let me take \u2013 let me start off. And then Akhil can fill in the details. But we're on track. We're going to spend about $500 million this year on restructuring. First quarter was light, only about $62 million.", "But importantly, we announced a couple of big initiatives at the Climate, Controls business. That is the closure of a couple of the big facilities. Those as you can imagine are very, very difficult decisions. We think they're the right thing to do for the business. And we will continue to do the right thing for the business, even as we are perhaps chastised by some of the politicians.", "The fact is this is a globally competitive marketplace that we operate in. And we have to do what's right for everyone, shareowners, the employees, the communities that we operate in.", "So, look, tough decisions. We have plans in place to help employees through these transitions, through our employee scholar program. We offer people a full 4 years of college education if they're displaced by any of this outsourcing. We provide significant severance and out-placement assistance.", "All those things you have to do, keeping in mind you still have to do the tough things. And I give credit to the CCS team. I know they're getting beat up a little bit out there in the media. But we have to do the right thing for the business. And we will continue to do that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi, thank you. I just wanted to...", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Julian.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. I just wanted to start on Otis. I guess one of your peers had talked about Southern Europe stabilizing. Doesn't look like you saw that yet in service. And then also they seemed to find the competitive temperature of the water sort of heating up a lot in Q1. Again, doesn't sound like you saw that in China. So just wanted your thoughts on those two points.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, Julian. Look, I think Europe was a better story for us this quarter than we had seen in the past. If you go back and look at our last four quarters, the service in Europe had been down sort of mid-single-digit. And this quarter it's down 1%. So it's a trend in the right direction.", "We saw growth in our portfolio and the number of units under maintenance in EMEA were up sequentially from December to March. So that's another good sign.", "Pricing pressure continues there, but that's not a surprise. That doesn't abate that quickly. As you know, the big driver of pricing will be either conversion of new equipment into service contracts and/or inflation. And those two are still not there in the European economy. So I think we'll see that come through, but it's probably further out.", "With regard to China, it was good to see the growth in the units of 2% in the orders this quarter. And the order rate in value terms was better than we had expected. So I think we're seeing some traction there with improving sales effectiveness, with improving product positioning. So feel relatively good; it's one quarter, but the trends were encouraging.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think I'd also add there, Julian, Akhil and I just got back from a trip to the Middle East and to Southern Europe. We were visiting with Otis customers and visiting the Otis branch offices. And I think it's clear that the guys running the offices have a good handle on what they need to do to stem the price erosion that we've seen. Again none of these things happen overnight. It is good, as Akhil said, to see some stabilization. We visited both the Otis brand in the offices as well as some of our second tier brands.", "I mean they have good strategies. Again I think as we saw in Spain when we were in Madrid, the economy there has bottomed out, unemployment is getting a little bit better. Even in Italy, despite some of the issues around the banking crisis, we still see growth in some of the major cities.", "So it's not doom and gloom in Europe. I think it's stabilizing, as we said, and should bode well for the years to come.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks. And then my second question, just on Aero Systems, you had a pretty hefty EBIT drop in Q1. I just wondered if there was a big weighting within that of your \u2013 sort of the comp year on year from the contract and license agreements? You had dialed in $150 million headwind for the year from that item. Is that very sort of Q1 or first half weighted?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I wouldn't call that out specifically, Julian. That was about $40 million of the $150 million was in first quarter year over year. I think the bigger thing is if you go back and look at the quarterly profile of UTAS, Q1 was their strongest quarter. Again organic growth was the strongest in Q1. Profitability was the strongest in Q1. Provisioning was pretty good in Q1 last year. So I think as we go through this year, the compares get a little bit better.", "This $68 million change in year-over-year profit was very much in line with our expectations, certainly for first quarter. So no drama there.", "What will happen is we'll see better results from cost reduction efforts that Dave Gitlin and team are putting in, in the rest of the year, compared to first quarter. And the mix starts to get a little bit better, especially given what we saw with the decline in the legacy businesses in the first quarter of this year. So it's more I think just again consistent with our expectations. No change, no drama. I would say UTAS came in exactly where we expected it to.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per caller. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes, thank you very much. So, I know that the 19% increase in commercial spares in first quarter at Pratt presumably was the big price hike, plus the V2500 turbine overhaul coming up. But can you give us some color? I mean is 0 to 2 still the right number for spares for the year? And maybe focus both on Pratt and UTAS and what your revised guide assumes for Pratt aftermarket compares in the second half? Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So, Cai, you've got both the points right. I think we had the benefit of very strong orders in Q4 of 2015. And so some of the sales associated with those orders flew in Q1, which was helpful. We also saw some timing related purchases in Q1 associated with V2500 engine, as you pointed out. So both those factors drove our exceptional 19% in Q1.", "Compares will be more difficult in the back half, especially in Q4, which was a decent quarter for Pratt as you know in commercial aftermarket. So while we think there is upward pressure on aftermarket, commercial aftermarket at Pratt, I'd like to wait for one more quarter and see the trends in Q2 before taking \u2013 officially adjusting the guidance, if you will, for aftermarket for Pratt.", "UTAS, very much in line with what our expectations were. 1% growth in commercial aftermarket for first quarter. Low single-digit growth for the full year, slightly better in the back half than first quarter, largely on the back of provisioning and spare parts. And I think we have \u2013 all on track.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So you're still at 0 to 2 at Pratt?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It could be. If there's upward pressure there, clearly. But to give you a more precise number, I think let's wait for one more quarter of trends.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, I think obviously we're very encouraged, Cai, as you would expect with 19%. But as Akhil said, the back half, especially fourth quarter compare will be more difficult. But clearly, we think there may be some upside. But we'll see. It is early as I pointed out. It's only April. So just keep those expectations in check here today.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Cai.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Doug.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Morning, Doug.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "On Otis and CC&S in China, when you look at where you stand right now, I know, Greg, you've talked about the need at Otis for additional product development there. It feels that over the last years there's been a real focus on cost reduction, both in CC&S and in Otis, with the goal of getting margins higher.", "As you look at your position in products today, particularly with respect to China, both at Otis and CC&S, what do you see in terms of the positioning right now? Investments that may need to be made? Where is this likely to head over the next 2 years?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think both Philippe [Delpech] and Bob McDonough laid it out pretty well. We've had to make some additional investments in the product line, especially if I think about CCS, that's got to be in the big chillers. It's a big market in China. We don't have huge share there. Good share, but not leading share today. And so we have to continue to make investments in products.", "It's the same at Otis. Otis has got some again decent share in China. But we need to make investments. We need to continue to drive the innovation theme, as opposed to the margin theme. And as a result you'll see. I mean Otis margins are down this quarter, but that's okay.", "I think our focus here is the long term, and that is driving more product into the hands of the customer, so that service can ultimately be the driver of growth.", "If you think about service in China today, it was up 15% though the first quarter at Otis. So we're getting momentum. Unit orders as we said were up 2%, even though overall orders were down a little bit in Otis China. So we're getting some traction. But more investment. So we're not done there on the innovation and the investment side.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Does this mean that in both units should we expect to see a little bit of margin headwind, say this year and next? I know that was kind of what it looked like at the Investor Day with the margin expansion really coming farther down the line, so the 2018 to 2020 timeframe.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think \u2013 keep in mind CCS still has some margin runway, as Bob pointed out. 70 basis points this quarter is a little bit more than what we expected. But again organic was down 1%. So I think Bob has got some opportunities on the cost-reduction side as well as the top line. For Otis we are going to see a little bit of contraction, clearly. As we try and regain market share, you're going to see pressure on the margins.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "But as we've talked about many times, I think the focus is on starting to grow operating profit at Otis, not focusing so much on the margin percent by itself. Because ultimately it will be better for the shareholders if we can start growing earnings at Otis, even if it comes with a slightly lower margin percent.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. You can't service elevators you don't sell.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Wanted to focus in on HVAC. And I guess I'll put Transicold and resi aside, because as you said we've can get whipsawed on comps, and Transicold and resi we've got the 13 to 14 SEER noise. It does look and feel like there's some slippage there though in the commercial business. I guess, Greg, you addressed it a little bit on China, just now in chillers.", "But can you update us on where you're at on product rollout in that business? Do you think there's some share erosion in North America? And how do you plan to address that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. One quarter does not a trend make, Jeff, as you know. I think last year as we looked at the market share trends improving, that was on the back of I'd say some big new product introductions, especially on the big, big machines, the 3,000 ton chillers.", "First quarter was weaker than what we had expected, clearly, on the commercial side, not just in the U.S., but globally. But we have been making investments. We've doubled the R&D spend at Carrier on the \u2013 especially focused on the big machines on the commercial side. So feel pretty good about where we are.", "But still a lot of work to do. I think this is the one area where Bob has got the team focused. Because look, the rest of the business, I think the resi business in the U.S. very strong, solid market share, good margins. Refrigeration business, as we said lumpy, but still very, very solid from a market share perspective. Commercial HVAC, there's some work to do here.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And as one of the things, Jeff, Bob talked about at the March meeting, Middle East, we are seeing particular pressure in the commercial HVAC business. I think the orders there were down over 40%. And that shows up in the overall numbers. It's an important area for us for CCS. And that's facing its own challenges right now.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And just a quick one on Otis, and I'll pass the baton. Just bridging the gap from units up 2% to dollar revenues down 7%. That 9 points, I assume that's not all price. But can you give us some color on price mix within that spread?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Pricing is a large part of that, but there is some mix element as well. I would say probably 80% of that figure that you quoted would be price, and the rest would be mix. But I don't have the precise data here.", "But I think it's not \u2013 pricing was a little worse than what we expected, but not that much worse. I think there is always a concern when the market goes down, price tends to follow that a little bit, as all players start to go off lower market units. But it was good to see that Otis was able to stake its own claim in terms of growing the number of units in the order base. And that was encouraging for us.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think the other thing to think about, Jeff, is China actually looks like it's stabilizing. And we've seen some rebound in the residential housing market. As you know that 60% of what Otis sells there goes into the resi market, residential housing. So that looks like it's stabilized. And we're starting to see an uptick in especially tier 1, tier 2 cities in terms of residential sales again.", "So while we had kind of planned for the worst, I don't think it's going to be as bad as what we had thought in China. And we should get a little bit of traction there on the \u2013 as the recovers in the residential market.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great.

But I really can't talk about anything specifically unfortunately.", "But again it just bodes well, if you think about for Pratt's military business, really for decades to come. Now we have the JSF, we've got the Long Range Strike [Bomber]. Clearly, Pratt's got a huge backlog coming.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then maybe just one more quick engine question, right? I mean there has been all this press about A320s piling up because of engines and so on and so forth. Can you just give us some color on kind of where we are on that? And what's going on with the fixes to the engine to get everything kind of back to normal?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think \u2013 well, we mentioned it earlier I think. We delivered I think 14 engines in the quarter. We're exactly on plan with Airbus in terms of the ramp up that we had expected.", "As I mentioned as well, 99% plus dispatch reliability, getting better fuel burn than what we expected. And we had the latest software drop that Bob Leduc talked about in March that corrected about 80% of the nuisance faults. Everything else by June will be incorporated in the production engines. And by the end of the year we'll have retrofitted all the engines we shipped in the first half of the year with the software and everything else.", "So the engine is performing well and couldn't be happier in terms of the dispatch reliability. I think if you talk to the pilots, you talk to the airlines, they like the engine. And no bad news here.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "All right. Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.", "Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT", "Yes, good morning, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Peter.", "Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT", "Just, Greg, I wanted just to go back to kind of Cai's question on commercial aftermarket within UTAS. Just I get it that the growth is in line with the expectations. And I know predicting after-market growth is more art than science. But what \u2013 this seems to be just trending a little below either \u2013 what we've seen from other companies reported. Maybe you could just give us a little color, kind of specifically what's going on in the UTAS commercial after-market.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, it's trending about in line with what we had expected. To your point, Peter, this is more art than science. But we know the fundamentals are still out there. We know that neos deliveries are going to pick up. We know you're going to see C-series enter into service here middle of the year. A350s are going to ramp up.", "So we would expect to see a better trend as we go throughout the year. Keep in mind first quarter, a tough compare at UTAS on the initial provisioning. We saw initial provisioning drop off significantly after the first quarter of last year. I think that's right, Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Uh-huh.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And so it should be \u2013 a little easier compare will help. RPMs continue to be strong. Is there upside at UTAS? I don't know. Certainly, Pratt looks more promising today. But it is early in the year. So I don't think there's anything to panic about. It's just a lot of it timing.", "Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT", "Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. Greg, I want to go back to sort of something you talked about at the very beginning and said, the contingency has expanded. And it's now at around $250 million. Can you elaborate a little bit on your thought process in terms of how you might want to use that going forward? Some of it might very well \u2013 well, I'll just stop there. Keep it simple.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "He helped us. Go ahead.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mr. Rubel, how would you like me to use that? Should we pass it through in higher earnings?", "No, look, it's as we said, as Akhil said, $250 million of contingency at the midpoint at $6.45, clearly it's early. But what that does is it bodes well. I think we've got a range out there for a reason of $6.30 to $6.60.", "I think as we get to the end of this quarter, the second quarter, we'll take another look at the overall results. And if everything is in line, you could expect us to probably take a really hard look at the range again. But it's early, it's April. Could you see higher earnings than the consensus out there, $6.50? Maybe. But, look, let's just wait.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The other thing, Howard, is as you know FX can change very quickly, right? I mean it's only 6 months ago, people were talking about going to parity for euro and now it is $1.13 and everybody is feeling good. All it would take is for Fed to signal that they are going to take the interest rates up here, and you'll see euro go back down towards that level.", "So it's April. It's too early. The CCS order trends is something we need to continue to watch as we have said. And then if the Pratt aftermarket stays at this level, then obviously that's good news. But it could change again. So it's \u2013 I know I have developed an internal nickname here of wet blanket. But I think it's appropriate to kind of use ...", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We like to think his balance works at UTC, right? So Akhil's pessimism, my optimism, which is unusual, it all kind of balances out here. So we like where we are. We like \u2013 we think the consensus is right in line. And I don't think there's much more to say about it, Howard.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "No, I appreciate the candor and color. Just as a follow-up a little bit, the benefit of where you have been is that there are some markets where commodity prices have been a little bit better. And there's some other cost benefits that have sort of come out of where you are today.", "What are you doing \u2013 or what do you ask some of the operating executives to do to either take advantage of this continued weakness in commodities in other markets to help the business longer term?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So as you know, Howard, on the CCS side we have a program in place to hedge through our copper requirement specifically. And we have through our supply agreements, we have long-term arrangements with suppliers where we have a price fixed for copper for the next several quarters.", "And based on that we know that our first half commodity tailwind is slightly greater than what we expect for the second half. We are looking at some of the similar arrangements on the Aerospace side, particularly with regard to a couple of long lead items, like nickel and others. But there's still some work to be done on that. But that's the direction we have with the corporate executives. Peter Longo in his new role as the Ops VP is looking at that hard with the business units.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Howard.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes. You may have addressed this, but there's a lot going on today. But at Pratt the deliveries in the quarter were 9% or 10% less than what Bob Leduc had shown us in the March slides. So I was wondering what that disconnect was?", "And then the second part is that with aftermarket at Pratt as strong as it was, it's probably up $250 million with commensurate aftermarket profits, it seemed like the margin at Pratt was a little bit lower, even after going through your comments about the losses on the new engine. So if you could further explain that? Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So on the EBIT road map for Pratt, let me answer that first, and then touch back on the quarter question that you asked on the deliveries.", "On the EBIT road map I think Paul mentioned we had about $70 million headwind from the commercial OE mix on the OE side, right, for large commercial. That included both large commercial engines and Pratt Canada, $60 million of the $70 million was negative engine margin, up year over year. $50 million, Paul talked about, was the headwind from military mix that was there. And then there was another $25 million higher E&D when you strip out FX and pensions. So that was the net negatives in the Pratt EBIT.", "On the positive side you had about $80 million drop through from the higher commercial aftermarket. We had about $40 million good news from pensions, and another $15 million (49:14) from Pratt Canada FX. So when you net all that you're within rounding of $17 million of down year over year profit.", "With regard to the deliveries I think we saw some change \u2013 slight change in the V2500 deliveries. Paul, I'm \u2013 is that...", "Paul Lundstrom - VP, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. But importantly, GTF was exactly what Bob had laid out and what we had talked about in March.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And, Akhil, so at $80 million aftermarket. I would have thought the aftermarket profit would have been somewhat bigger, given the aftermarket revenue. But maybe some of it...", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Keep in mind, George, that this includes the repair side of it as well. It's not just all spares, right? So it has the overhaul and repairs aspect, the wrench-turning side of it, which comes with much lower margins, as you can imagine.", "And then there is always some element of mix that comes in with regard to whether it's more of the IAE deliveries, which come with some kind of an intangible amortization that relates to the Rolls Royce payments, right? So combination of all that is what drives that drop through of $80 million.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Steve.", "Operator", "If your phone is on mute, please un-mute.", "Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, maybe Akhil, the \u2013 because you're the pessimist in the family. The cash flow performance in the quarter and the conversion, even if you correct for the settlement charge, it did seem light. And so getting to that 90% to 100% every year seems like a bit of a stretch. But this year you're even more looking like you're down the road to a stretch. Is this a really 4Q-weighted load? Or do you start to see material improvement here in the nearer term?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, Myles, first quarter was a little light. But it's not \u2013 again not unexpected. So adjusted for this Pratt Canada, the Canadian royalty settlement, we were about 65%. And if you go back and look at our history, there have been quarters where have been 44% and in fact as low as 34%, because I did look at that just to satisfy myself that we were still on track. And we have hit 100% of net income.", "So this year is with the Aero ramp, we obviously do not want to disappoint our customers. And we are making sure that we have inventories and buffer stock and all the things that Bob Leduc talked about ahead of when our needs are to some extent. We do expect still to be able to get to the 90% to 100% level, maybe towards the lower end of the range. But definitely towards the 90% to 100%.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think, Myles, to keep in mind, working capital grew almost $370 million more this year in first quarter than it did last year. And most of that was at the engine company. And that's again the back-end load of the production build on the GTF as we do the ramp.", "So naturally you're going to see the liquidation of some of that inventory. Bob is obviously more concerned I think about making deliveries today than he is about inventory. But he understands the need to liquidate that through the course of the year. So better to be safe than sorry I would say at this point.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then the dividend raise yesterday or the day before, obviously in line with your implied EPS growth. Do we expect that to kind of be the go-forward pattern? As you accelerate your earnings into 2017 and 2018, similarly the dividend growth would return?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think it's \u2013 as we've said we've been \u2013 maybe the thing to focus on here, Myles, is the payout ratio. It's 41% with the last dividend raise. So while it was a modest 3% increase, last year earnings did not go up. In fact they went down. This year a modest growth in earnings, dividend rise in line with that.", "But as earnings accelerate through the end of the decade, as the top line grows as we expect, you could expect to see that payout ratio remain in that kind of 35% to 40% range, maybe closer to the 40%.", "But clearly, we've got confidence in the future. And we didn't \u2013 as we debated how much to take the dividend up, I think this was the prudent course at 3% with a 41% payout ratio. And we continue to look at it every year.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning, thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Greg, on first question back on GTF. Recently in the press I saw something saying the ramp is going to be 200, 400, 600 engines per year. Want to make sure that we're still on track for kind of the 200, 400, 800? And that you're still thinking 2018 is the peak loss?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's exactly right. So this year Pratt is committed to just over 200 engines. Again the majority of that's on the neo. Some of those are going to Bombardier on the C-series. That doubles next year. And then it goes up another 200 the following year.", "And to your point we'll see maximum negative engine margin in 2018. It's nice to say we're coming down the cost curve as we're delivering these engines. Still a long way to go. But I think Bob would tell you, Bob Leduc that is, got high confidence in hitting target cost here. And seeing those negative engine margins then start to flatten out and then decrease somewhat, as we conclude the decade.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And I'm sure you don't want to talk about 2017, but...", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Nope.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "But just a quick one there. Well, you previously commented that you would expect Otis EBIT to \u2013 Otis and UTAS EBIT to grow in 2017. I guess now that we're a little bit further in, how do you feel about that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Look, do I think they should grow? Yes. We're not going to give guidance though, David, today on 2017. There's a lot of moving pieces here.", "The Otis part especially, because of some of the continued investments we're going to make in R&D will give them some headwind next year. It's hard to say. We're trying it in Europe. We're going to go. But generally speaking, they're making the decisions today to take cost out to invest. And we feel good about the prospects as we go through these next couple of years for both businesses.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "All right. Well, thank you everyone for listening. Again good first quarter. Paul and team will be available all day for any follow-up questions. We thank you for listening. And we'll see you all next month at EPG. All right. Take care.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

LLC", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the United Technologies Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Vice President, Investor Relations.", "This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations and excluding restructuring costs and significant other items of a non-recurring and or non-operational nature often referred to by management as significant other items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings including its 10-Q and 10-K report provide details and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. So a really solid Q2 and a great start to the year. With these results, we're very, very comfortable with our long-term outlook and we continue to be on track to the 2020 growth target that we laid out back in March of this year. As I told you previously, we are focused on execution and delivering on our commitments. The old UTC of under promise and over deliver is our goal again.", "And we're seeing the results of that focus reflected in our Q2 performance. Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.82 on almost $15 billion of sales. Through the first half, adjusted earnings per share are up 6% on 2% organic sales growth. We're also of course raising the bottom end of our guidance by $0.15. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60 and we're also increasing the bottom end of our sales expectations. We now see 2016 sales of $57 billion to $58 billion. That's up from our previous expectations of $56 billion to $58 billion. And we continue to expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in what remains a low growth and volatile macro environment.", "I'll turn it over to Akhil and Paul in a moment to walk you through details but four key takeaways from today.", "First of all, execution remains our top priority. The Geared Turbofan is performing exceptionally well in service, 99.8% dispatch reliability with over 5,000 revenue hours and four operators. We're meeting our commitments on fuel burn, noise and emissions.", "Second, we continue to invest and innovate for growth. CCS has introduced several new innovative residential products, and we recently announced Otis partnership with Microsoft and AT&T to collaborate on digital solutions that will enhance connectivity and the customer experience.", "Third, we're also of course seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and we remain focused on cost reduction, structural cost reduction. CCS expanded margins by an exceptional 130 basis points in the quarter and corporate expenses were nearly 20% lower versus last year.", "Number four, finally, we continue to stay disciplined with our capital and evaluate the best ways to utilize our cash to maximize share and value. We'll complete the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan in the third quarter, and we're on track to return $22 billion in cash to shareowners from 2015 through 2017. And we recently announced two strategically important acquisitions that are right in the core of our business. Otis will acquire Schindler's service business in Japan and CCS acquired a 70% stake in Riello which is a heating and cooling business in Europe. This will enhance our offerings to our European customers. Just exactly as we said, in the core and disciplined.", "These are just a few of the many examples of why we're executing our key priorities. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the results and I'll be back in a moment with some closing comments. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Greg. Taking a look at slide two, organic sales were up 1% in the quarter. Most recent data on the U.S. economy continues to be encouraging. Consumer spending remains strong and job creation, wage growth and unemployment trends point to a steady growth environment, although more likely in the 2% GDP growth range as opposed to the 3% plus that we would all like to see.", "During the second quarter, our commercial businesses saw 3% growth in the Americas, driven by Otis which was up 10%. Sales at CCS were flat as lower commercial HVAC exports and field and security sales were offset by 3% growth in U.S. residential HVAC. Looking at Europe and the Middle East, sales were flat at both Otis and CCS, reflecting little change in the trends or the macro conditions. While Brexit has caused some uncertainty in the region, we don't expect a near-term impact in our businesses.", "In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices particularly in the tier 1 cities show growth year-to-date, the elevator new equipment market is down and price pressure has increased. For Asia as a whole, sales were down 3% principally driven by China. We're consistent with our expectations. We saw sales at Otis decline 7% while CCS sales in China were down 2%.", "Commercial aerospace sales growth of 7% was primarily driven by another strong aftermarket quarter at Pratt and mid single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket at Aerospace Systems. On the military side, sales were down 8% driven by original equipment declines at Pratt, primarily due to headwinds from the F117 program, where as you know, engine production finished in Q1 this year and declines in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket as the C-5 nacelle retrofit program is now complete.", "Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide three. Just as a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So, at Otis, new equipment orders were down 4%, driven by China where orders were down 14 % on a dollar basis. They were up 4% on a unit basis however. Excluding China, new equipment orders at Otis were up 3% with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA in both cases off tough compares.", "Total equipment orders at CCS were down 4%, driven by transport refrigeration which was down almost 30%. Recall that in Q2 of 2015, Carrier Transicold was up almost 30%. Excluding transport refrigeration, orders were flat in the quarter. Low to mid single-digit growth in fire and security and commercial refrigeration orders was offset by a high single-digit decline in commercial HVAC entirely due to Europe and the Middle East. Commercial HVAC equipment orders in the Americas were up low single-digit with mixed single-digit growth in Asia. While U.S. residential HVAC sales, and that is what we include in the total equipment orders metric, were up 3%, orders were actually up 11% in the quarter.", "Moving to aerospace. At UTC Aerospace Systems, after a slow start in Q1, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%, and Pratt & Whitney saw another quarter of very strong commercial aftermarket sales, up 20% driven primarily by the V2500.", "Moving to slide four. Total reported sales of $14.9 billion were up 1% versus the prior year as one point of organic growth and 1% from acquisitions were offset by a point of headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 9%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.71 which included $0.11 of restructuring and other onetime significant items.", "As Greg said, we continue to focus on cost control and you will see that our restructuring spend year-to-date is about $180 million. Based on the first half spend, we now expect our full year restructuring to be approximately $400 million, down from the $500 million previously discussed. However, we will still realize the expected savings as we have been able to successfully divest a couple of businesses which were on the restructuring list and we have been disciplined about not fully replacing voluntary attrition.", "Free cash flow was 100% of net income in the quarter, driven by strong working capital performance in our commercial businesses, partially offset by the continued aero ramp-related investments at Pratt & Whitney. As Greg said, we have increased the full year outlook and now expect sales of $57 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.45 to $6.60. With a solid first half, we are confident in raising the low end of the EPS range by $0.15 and we still have about $75 million of contingency at the higher midpoint of $6.53. We continue to expect organic sales growth of 1% to 3% and full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100%.", "There are some puts and takes within the business unit guidance that Paul will go through, but as we look to the remainder of the year, we expect the businesses to generate slightly higher earnings in the second half as compared to the first half. We will also benefit from slightly lower share count in the second half. However, this will be entirely offset by higher interest expense in the second half compared to the first half as well as some higher second half expenses below the segment. As a result, second half earnings per share are likely to be around the same level as the first half earnings per share. Bottom line is that we feel very good about our improved outlook for the year.", "Looking beyond 2016, we continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures. Two watch items that have recently come on the radar screen after Brexit. One, general strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and second, lower yields on both long and short bonds. As you know, lower discount rates could have a significant impact on our pension expense for 2017 and beyond. While it is still too early, as a reminder, every 10 basis points change in the discount rate is around a $30 million profit impact.", "With that, let me hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail.", "Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on page five. And please note, I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency and adjusted to exclude restructuring charges and other significant items as we usually do. Also note, we've included an appendix on page 11 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. Hopefully, that's helpful.", "In the quarter, Otis sales were $3.1 billion. That was up 2% at constant currency. Otis profit at nearly $600 million was down 4%. Continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, coupled with additional E&D investments, more than offset contribution from higher volume. Foreign exchange translation was a 2-point headwind to sales and a 1-point headwind to earnings.", "New equipment sales increased 2%, led by 24% growth in North America. The North America new equipment business continues to benefit from the strong orders intake we've seen over the last few years, particularly in office space and hospitality. China new equipment sales were in line with expectations, down 9% in the quarter.", "Otis service sales were up 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up slightly in the quarter. Better than expected foreign exchange translation -- based on better than expected foreign exchange translation, we now expect full year operating profit at Otis to be down between $150 million and $200 million. That's a $50 million improvement from the guidance that we laid out in December on low single-digit organic sales growth.", "On the next page, climate controls and security sales were up 1% at constant currency with 2 points of growth from acquisitions, the majority of which came from the acquisition of Riello. That growth was \u2013 that growth from acquisitions was partially offset by a 1% organic sales decline. Profits were up 8% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind for both sales and profits.", "As with Otis, you can find global segment data in the appendix, but to call out a few highlights, during the quarter, we saw 3% organic sales growth in North America residential HVAC. As you heard us discuss midway through the second quarter, we had a slow start to the cooling season but sales picked up significantly in June. In fact, for residential it was the best June we've seen in about seven years. On the other hand, following the weak orders we saw in Q1, Transicold sales were down 6% in the quarter. Weak freight rates in the global shipping lines continued to put pressure on the container business which was down 39%.", "Despite a softer top line, CCS continue to deliver profit growth. Earnings were up 8%, driven by benefits from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Although operating margins grew to a record 20.4%, we continue to invest in product development, holding E&D to prior year levels. For the year, although first half organic growth was weaker than expected with easier back half compares, continued productivity momentum, and favorable foreign exchange translation, we continue to expect operating profit growth of $100 million to $150 million at actual FX on low single-digit organic sales at Climate, Controls & Security.", "Turning to aerospace on slide seven. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. This was driven by another strong commercial aftermarket quarter, up 20% including 3 points of benefit from a sale of legacy hardware. Strong V2500 activity drove the growth in the form of both pre-buy from a service bulletin and also from where we are in the cycle for this engine. The average age of the V2500 fleet is now about nine years old and that's a sweet spot for overhaul activity, and we continue to see RPM growth. In the large commercial engine business, Geared Turbofan shipments in the quarter were higher than in Q1, but less than we expected back in March. Although it's safe to say that our customers would love to take additional engines this year, we continue to expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines in 2016.", "For Pratt Canada, engine shipments were down versus the prior year as we continue to see weaker demand in the general aviation and helicopter markets. Pratt operating profit was $452 million, down 8%. Drop through from the strong aftermarket volume and benefits from pension and FX were more than offset by headwinds from higher negative engine margin, adverse military mix and higher E&D.", "We also made some additional investments to support the industrial ramp. The absence of last year's gain from a product line sale and contract closeouts were a headwind, but were offset by favorable contract settlements in the legacy hardware sale I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we now expect the commercial aftermarket to be up mid single-digit. Drop through from that higher aftermarket volume will be more than offset, however, by headwinds from lower than expected military sales, fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments, higher E&D and the additional ramp-related investments. Add it all up and we now expect operating profit for the year to be down $50 million to $100 million at Pratt & Whitney.", "At Aerospace Systems, operating profit increased 2% on 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial OE, up 5% with growth on next-generation platforms partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket volumes accelerated as anticipated, also up 5% and included growth in parts, provisioning and repair. Consistent with our full year outlook, the growth we saw in commercial OE and aftermarket was partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in military. Military OE sales declines were driven by continued lower legacy fighter trainer and transport programs, while the military aftermarket decline was driven largely by the expected completion of the C-5 Nacelle retrofit program.", "Operating profit growth was driven by strong conversion on higher commercial aftermarket sales, pension tailwind and continued cost reduction progress. As expected, headwinds included adverse military OE mix, primarily from declines in legacy program rates and lower military volume. With first half results largely in line with our expectations and improving organic growth profile and solid execution on cost reduction initiatives, we continue to expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Paul. So encouraging start to the year with 2% organic growth and slightly better than expected earnings. Based on this first half, we feel very good about the year. We obviously raised the low end of the guidance by $0.15. We took up the revenue, low end of the revenue guidance, so again, very comfortable about the year. But as Akhil noted, let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the global macro environment and this is a long journey. And we've laid out a plan through 2020 and we feel very confident about that plan.", "For the meantime though, we're going to remain focused on our key priorities. That's cost reduction, always doing more with less. Investing an innovation for growth. We'll be disciplined in our capital allocation. Most importantly, we're going to focus on executing out the record aero backlog. As I said many times before, I've never been more confident in UTC's long-term outlook. With the aero backlog and the investments we've made on all of our businesses, we continue to be set up for above GDP growth, well into the future.", "With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions. Karen?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a quick question on Pratt. You had good aftermarket growth, but the organic growth was well below that aftermarket growth. So what shrunk in the quarter to kind of offset what happened in the aftermarket??", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. The \u2013 if you'll notice, Ron, the commercial OE shipments were lower than last year. Also, on the military OE side, we had fewer engine shipments and then Pratt Canada OE shipments were lower as well. So I think it is more about the OE story where commercial was \u2013 commercial and military OE was down.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Super, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Thank you. My question would be on Otis. So Otis China, you seem to see the price mixed delta get quite a bit worse in Q2 than Q1, similar to the market leader there, I think price mix must have been down sort of high teens against nine (21:04) in Q1. So I guess the price mix headwind for the year in EBIT is probably bigger than what you guided back in December and March. What are the sort of offsets in the organic earnings guide in Otis? Is it cost cutting or Europe after market?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, Julian, first of all, even though the delta between the value at 14% down versus units up 4% feels large, 18 points, only half of that is pricing. Rest had to do with more the mix, if you will, right. We had last year's significant major projects at higher value per unit and this year that's not been the case. So it's about 9% price out of that delta which is a couple of points worse than what we saw in first quarter, not the dramatic number that you would conclude without having this context. And so it's not \u2013 I mean, overall, we think pricing for China this year is just slightly worse for the P&L impact for this year. Yes, the margin and backlog is a little worse than what we were expecting. But offset to that, as always in China is to greater cost reduction from suppliers. Price pressure in China is not new. Otis is very used to dealing with that. They also can get significant cost reductions on suppliers. And that's what they will do.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the aerospace OEMs? And we saw a supplier yesterday talk about slow payments, I know that they've been pushing change in terms, and just if you can talk a little bit about that. Just I noticed the receivables were up about $600 million sequentially, not sure if that plays into it at all, but just what's happening from the OEM customers?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, Sam, it's Greg. I would say the pressure on cost continues unabated at the OEM levels. We have Scope Program (23:02) currently in Airbus to \u2013 we've talked to Boeing about Partnering for Success 2.0. There's obviously a lot of pressure in a very competitive environment to reduce costs and we obviously are working with the customers to find ways to take cost out of the product. But it's got to be win-win for us. As far as the payment terms, I know there's been some talk out there. We have not seen any extension of payment terms beyond that which we have in the contract. And we have general terms agreements with both Boeing and Airbus and they pay to those terms. So we have not really seen any big deterioration in receivables as it relates to any or either the operators.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Just to clarify, Sam, the increase in receivables that you referred to, some of it has to do with the acquisition that we had and also we had a very strong June as Paul referred to in the script. So, when you have late sales in the quarter, you tend to have more receivables because you just haven't had enough time to collect it as part of your normal terms.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, strong residential HVAC sales in June.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, Sam.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hey, I was hoping to ask a, I guess a multifaceted question on cash. Thank you for the pension color on the P&L. But just thinking about cash this year and into next year, can you give us an update on what, if any, cash call the pension could have next year? And then, Akhil, it was interesting that structuring is coming down a bit. Is there some cash use relief there? And then finally, cash working capital, actually looked okay in the quarter relative to what I was expecting. How does that play out over the rest of the year and maybe the ability to whittle away at some of the safety stocks into next year?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Great, great question, Jeff. Good to see the focus on cash. But clearly, I think on pension side, we have no mandatory requirements to fund. Of course, depending on where the discount rate ends up on December 31, the pension deficit could be a little worse than what we reported at the end of December last year. But definitely, there is no mandatory requirement for us to fund domestic pension, pension plan. We will evaluate it as part of our normal cash utilization capital deployment plan and see if we need to do anything on a voluntary basis, but no call on it.", "The second question was about restructuring. It's not a meaningful change, Jeff. The $100 million reduction that I talked about for the year, essentially was keeping the savings intact, could benefit a little bit on the cash side, but again, that's small and doesn't play out in one year, it generally plays out over a couple of years.", "And finally, on the working capital, as you know, I think it's \u2013 Greg had mentioned many times, we are not satisfied with where our working capital is, but we also understand the need to make up for some of the weaknesses we still have on our supply chain side through buffer stock and that is not necessarily going to come down that quickly. It is probably a multi-year effort as we get our suppliers to performing in goal levels which are very high standards by the way, right. We want people to have 95% or more on-time delivery and less than 500 PPM on quality. All that says is that, in order to meet our customer commitments, we will continue to have a little bit of buffer stock for a year or two more.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And just a quick one. Is there anything non-operational in the Otis margin? Thank you.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, not this quarter.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. I'm going to try to stick to one question. And just to talk about this investment in Pratt, Greg, how do you see that paying out over time? Or are the returns occurring in time?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, Howard, as you know, this is a \u2013 it's an expensive game in the commercial engines business. And I've said before we're going to invest or we have invested about $10 billion in CapEx and R&D over the last dozen years or so to bring the products to market. The good news is, at the end of the year, we should have all of the aircraft engines certified. We'll get Irkut. We'll get MRJ. We'll get Embraer. So the big phase of investment is really \u2013 will slow down after this year. We're not done. But in terms of the major spending, we should start to see that turn down. At the same time, as you know, we're going to see an uptick in negative engine margin. And as I look out over the next ten years or so, you're going to see a big number there, close to another $10 billion of negative engine margin on all of these platforms. That's going to step up in the next couple of years to get to about $1 billion in 2018. And they'll stay about that level. Even though production rates will increase, costs will come down but that is a significant investment.", "The good news of course is the aftermarket will come. As we saw this quarter on the V, when the engines get out there, that six-year, seven-year, eight-year timeframe, the engines do need to be overhauled. We will see the returns. But this is not a \u2013 it's not a short-term gain. These are 30-year programs. The returns remain on track to what we had expected which is well in excess of our cost of capital. But it's not for the faint of heart either, as you know, Howard. And we're in for the long-term. We've got great engines. The performance has been phenomenal out of the box. Right now, our focus is just on delivering engines and then servicing them for the next 25 years or 30 years.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Steve.", "Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, Paul, thanks for all the detail on slide 11, very value-add.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, good. Thanks.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "On CC&S, what is the now commodity spread for the year and what was it in the quarter?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So it was $50 million, good news in the quarter. This was probably the best quarter from commodities' point of view. For the full year, we expect about $125 million. That's CCS.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And is that a change from what you guys had had before?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Just slightly higher, not meaningful. Aluminum has been slightly better than we expected and that's showing up, but maybe $20 million to $25 million, not too much.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I'll give you a little more breakdown on that, Steve. When we talked about our guidance for CCS for the year, we had commodities and price together. So there is a price offset there in the second half. So it won't see quite as much tailwind as the $125 million.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just on the transport and \u2013 sorry, that's price costs, that's not just commodities, right?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Correct.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just on the transport business, you mentioned the container business was down substantially. What was kind of like core U.S. truck trailer down? And could you just remind us of, I know that's a profitable business, just the margin profile and the mix within there because your margin was really good despite transport being down. So, obviously, it wasn't a mixed drag that you weren't able to overcome.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, sure. So, if you look back a few years ago, the Transicold business, there was some disparity in margins amongst the different segments. Container was quite high and North America truck trailer was quite low. And that's changed over the years. If you look at the average margin, it's sort of at the CCS broader average today, and there's no major difference between the different segments. A little bit of color just on the quarter, North America truck trailer was essentially flat, but orders were down similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, at least for the North America truck trailer piece, we're largely booked for the third quarter as we should be at this point. So I would say we're okay.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, good morning. I just wanted to go back to the military business for a moment, Pratt and UTAS. Akhil, you did a nice job of explaining some of the puts and takes there, but I was wondering if you could perhaps let us know when you feel like you're going to have kind of a clean comp on a year-over-year basis, given the C-17 and the C-5. And then you \u2013 is that the first quarter 2017, I guess, is the question. And then on Pratt, you suggested that it was worse than expected this quarter on military. Can you just dive a little bit deeper on why it was worse than expected? Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So the first question in terms of when do we expect the turn in the military side, I think on Pratt probably 2016 is most likely a low point because of the mix shift that we have talked about and reduction in the F117 engines. First quarter next year, you will see improvement there on the F117 compares. For UTAS, the C-5 that we have talked about, that was \u2013 we saw some benefit of that in first quarter this year as well. So that two compares would become easier starting second quarter of 2017 onwards.", "For this quarter, slightly weaker than Pratt expectations. Actually, a lot of it was in line with what we expected. I didn't necessarily say it was hugely weaker than expected, it was \u2013 the slight shortfall was on the OE shipment side which were down year-over-year, partly due to what our production schedule was and partly due to some parts availability. But overall, it is okay.", "Karen, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. And I'll echo the comments on slide 11, very helpful. Unfortunately, it's taken half our questions, but...", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That'll keep your workforce down (33:10).", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I'm sure that was the reason, Paul. Just what \u2013 I mean sounds like the news flow on the neo engine was positive from Farnborough. Can you maybe just comment on that, Greg, and just give us an update on the quarterly phasing for the engines shipments in the back half of this year? And on top of that, does that place additional pressure on Pratt margins versus 2Q?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Nigel, I think \u2013 as you saw it coming out of the airshow, we had a very productive airshow from an orders standpoint, a couple of big orders. Right now, we stand at about 8,200 firm and option orders for the GTF and I think the operators, as I said, they all seem to love the engine. The dispatch reliability is good, so things look very positive from that standpoint. As far as production, I think it was Akhil or I guess Paul mentioned, going to build about 140 engines in the back half of the year. That will probably be spread pretty evenly over both of the next two quarters. That's up from what, 36 engines I think. We built 60 engines, 36 got delivered in the first half. So production ramp is continuing as we expect. A little pressure on negative margin in the back half of the year as we ramp up. But the good news is we're coming down the cost curve exactly as we had expected. We look at it every month. We look at it by engine. We're right on that 87% learning curve that Bob Leduc laid out earlier this year. So we feel good about the cost of the engines. We feel good about the ramp. Always a challenge, but we're working through it.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, gentlemen.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Greg, I wondered if you could expand on that a little bit? It looked like on the commercial OEM revenues, you were sort of off tens of millions, but the op profit delta year-over-year was probably more like $150 million or $200 million with Pratt being the vast majority of that. I wondered if you could speak to \u2013 are you seeing higher losses per engine or is there a non-recurring cost element and that just seemed like a pretty large number there on a year-over-year basis.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So I think the best way to answer that, Carter, would be to give you the EBIT roadmap, if you will, for Q2 for Pratt, right? So the negative engine margin, first of all, is exactly in line with what we expected. It's not higher than what \u2013 there are some additional ramp up costs that Paul referred to. But overall, we got about $120 million good news year-over-year on commercial aftermarket. Plus, we had another $55 million or so of good news between pension and E&D \u2013 sorry, pension and FX. Those were offset, so $175 million of good news offset by $70 million of negative engine margin, $50 million on the military mix issue that we've talked about before, F117 principally and others, another $35 million net of pension increase in E&D and then the rest about $50 million plus on Pratt Canada OE shipment reduction and the ramp up cost that we've talked about. So that's essentially the makeup of the Pratt earnings as to why Pratt earnings were down in spite of good strong commercial aftermarket.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think it's important, Carter, to point out, Pratt is doing what they need to do in terms of investing in the ramp. We've added about 400 people to the supply chain this year to make sure that the suppliers have adequate plans in place to deliver on their commitments for the ramp, and some of that investment that we're making will continue out into next year. It's a little bit more than we had originally expected, but it's what we need to do to make sure we get these engines out on time. So a little bit higher investment, but tracking exactly where we expected on cost.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Perfectly clear. Thanks for detail, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Carter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks so much. So it sounds like what you're saying is you expect now to deliver 175 engines versus 200. How are you doing on the supply chain because I know that's been an issue? And where are you with all the little technical issues? The start time, the error messages on the engines and when do you expect to have those behind you?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let's be clear on the production. We're going to build, deliver 200 engines this year. We built 60 in the first half of the year. We're going to build about 140 in the back half of the year which is exactly what we talked about or Bob Leduc talked about back in March. So, timing of revenue recognition might be a little bit different as I said. I think we actually revenue-recognized about 36 in the first half. Again, there's engines that are sitting there on the docks, sitting in transit. So feel good about the build plan. We're not going to come off of the 200. As far as the supply chain goes, there are always challenges. But if you think about this, with 8,000 parts and about 800 different subassemblies in this engine, there's a handful of parts that are causing some pain in the supply chain right now, and Bob and the team are all over this and we will get through this. On the technical stuff, I would tell you it's in the rearview mirror, Cai. The start time with the software drops have been pretty well addressed. The nuisance faults are behind us. As I said, 99.8% dispatch reliability with the four operators over 5,000 hours of revenue service since its introduction back in January. So the engine is performing exactly as we had expected and no surprises on cost, no surprises on delivery.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "How come you're only \u2013 you missed by \u2013 I guess you delivered 36 but you built 60. How come, given Airbus claims they want to have the engines, how come you were not able to ship more?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, they don't all go to Airbus, keep in mind. Some go to Embraer, some go to Bombardier, some go to MRJ. There's also a large number of spares that we built in the first half of the year to support the in-service fleet. So it's not just production there. Obviously, Airbus would like engines sooner, but we're exactly on the production plan we committed to them earlier this year.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Cai.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Noah.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Greg, you mentioned a few times through the call your confidence in your two 2020 revenue growth targets. And I look at the slide from the investor day, there's some pretty strong rates in there. It's a low of 4% and a high of 10%, depending on the segment and all kind of blends to 5% to 6%. And I guess the numbers you reported today are pretty good, but we're still walking along these low single-digit organic revenue growth levels. Not a ton of reason, I don't think, to expect 2017 to materially accelerate from 2016, correct me if that's wrong. So you would kind of need 2018, 2019, 2020 to be growing high single digits organically. Is that realistic? And what makes that happen outside of the macro getting better?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know I think you need to break that down, as you mentioned with the four segments. I would tell you I got the highest confidence in Pratt and in UTAS, just based on the backlog and the skylines coming out of Boeing and Airbus. We know the aircraft are going to be built. We've got those in backlog. So Pratt should see close to 10% organic growth. Keep in mind 200 GTF this year then 400 then 800, we're ramping up to almost 1,500 engines. So you will see growth accelerate on the GTF on all those platforms. And while the V goes away, that gets more than replaced with volumes with the neo, plus you've got volumes on Embraer, C-series, MRJ. All of those things give us really high confidence on the organic outlook at Pratt, and similarly at UTAS where the Aerospace Systems grew. They've got line of sight probably the 5% to 7% organic growth over this time period.", "The commercial businesses could be more challenging. I think that is the one soft spot. We saw CCS this quarter down 1% organically, Otis only up 2%, but we're making the right investments. We're spending money on E&D, on new products. We're spending money on digital at the commercial side to enhance growth. So I still see a clear pathway. Now, again, we assume the world's going to grow at 3%, not 2%, and if the world grows at 3% and we can get a little share with these products, we can be in that 4% to 5% range as we move towards 2017, 2018. But, clearly, it's more of a challenge on the commercial side. At the same time, keep in mind, the urbanization trends continue. The growth of the middle class continues. All of those things favor the commercial products. People need air conditioners. People need elevators. So we're confident in the product mix and in the growth outlook.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Noah, one additional data point on the UTAS business, I think we've talked about this, the content per aircraft is significantly higher on the new platform than the platforms that are being replaced as we've talked about going from 2 million per chipset to 4 million per chipset. So, even if the production rate of the aircraft does not increase too much, just the change in the introduction of the new platforms is going to increase the UTAS sales in any case. So I think aerospace side, as Greg said, very high level of confidence. You don't have to go out and compete those every day again for the 2020 skyline, it's more the commercial businesses.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's helpful. And, Akhil, what's now in the 2016 guidance for euro, dollar?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's $1.10.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So no change. Or I'm sorry, you were at $1 before, correct?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right. And that's part of the reason why we have increased our bottom end and also the Otis guidance if you will. And because...", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "...the euro has been around $1.12 or so for the first six months and we're expecting $1.10 for the next six months.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Noah.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Banc.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I think you said that aftermarket's now mid single-digit growth that with Pratt in the plan which probably gives you north of $150 million of additional EBIT, but the segment came down $50 million. So $200 million of higher EBIT in there being absorbed I guess by E&D and ramp costs, is that how you'd characterize it?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So let's do the full year math on EBIT Pratt, EBIT, right (44:10).", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, please. Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So commercial aftermarket would give probably $125 million of good news versus what we expected.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That would be offset by $50 million more in E&D, $50 million lower from military business and the remaining $75 million from the fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments plus the additional ramp costs that we talked about. So three high level things offsetting the good news from commercial aftermarket.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got it. That's perfect. And then if you think about, Greg, you said the \u2013 this is a follow-up to the same question. When you said that the certification of the engines are all done this year, E&D, how quickly does that drop over the next couple of years? Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think the roadmap has us going down about $250 million over the next three years as we look at the R&D. Again, just because the engine's certified doesn't mean all the flight testing's done. So there still is significant cost out there and we're not going to stop investing in the technology either. We're not going to go to zero. But clearly, you can expect to see it probably in that 4% to 5% range as a percentage of sales going forward.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, David.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Greg, I wanted to touch on Otis' new equipment in North America. The orders were up this quarter, but I think the smallest kind of increase we've seen in quite a while. Could you just frame the North American new equipment market and do you think we've kind of peaked out there in terms of order rate? Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Just to be clear, the U.S. order rate was actually up I think about 6% in the quarter. Canada was down big. There were some big projects that didn't repeat year-over-year. But we still see growth in the backlog at Otis this quarter in North America. So has it peaked out? I don't know if it's peaked. It's clearly back to where it was in 2007 which is good news. It'll probably \u2013 we won't certainly see double-digit growth. We're not expecting double-digit growth over the next year or two.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In the back half, David, you're right. There were some very strong orders in Otis North America last year like the Hudson Yards. So we \u2013 in the back half, we saw almost 50% growth in North American orders last year, and that clearly is going to be tough compares to jump off of, so don't be surprised if the orders in North America are down year-over-year in the back half. Again, very robust economy, things still look pretty good. The good news is that the orders from what we have seen over the last several quarters are converting into sales now. So the new equipment sales are very strong in North America and we expect that to continue for a period of time.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks for the color.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "On Otis and CC&S, after a few years of cost focus, you've talked about the need to spend more on product development in each of those business areas. Could you give us a sense of where that spending is going to occur and is this something we should see over the next couple years? And then see a margin benefit subsequently? Could you give us a sense of what that trajectory would be for the two businesses?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. So we talked about Otis spending only about 1% of sales on E&D, and a very small part of that was on actual new product. Most of the E&D historically has been on cost production. We can see that doubling over the next couple of years. We saw E&D up this quarter at Otis. We'll continue to see it grow over the next couple of years. They're investing in a couple of different things.", "First of all, refreshing the aesthetics in the cab, very important. We're doing that across the globe, and that's done in each individual market. We're also investing in high rise newbuild technology and looking at ways to again enhance the offering on the service side. So investments in new equipment, investments in service technology, investments in service productivity tools. On CCS, they've already doubled E&D over the last four years or five years. It's right about 2% of sales. It should continue at that level. The focus there is really on the large commercial chillers where we had not had a competitive offering for a number of years. Reinvesting in that business, we continue the see big opportunities in the big chiller side. But it will take several years and some additional R&D expenditures to get the product line where we need it to be.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Are these levels that you expect to continue as sort of a natural level for investment in these businesses or would there be a margin benefit that we would expect in a couple years down the road?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know what, I think, Doug, you've got to continue at this kind of 2% level of sales. Think about $30 billion commercial business, 2% of sales is about $600 million a year. It's not an unreasonable amount of money. And I want to \u2013 these are long-term businesses. You have to continue to invest. So, if I'm looking for margin opportunities on the commercial businesses, it's going to come from improving productivity on the service side at Otis and it's going to come from cost reduction on the CCS side.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes, good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "R&D was up $30 million year-over-year, Greg, and you've talked about it being up at Pratt, Otis. Can you break out how much it was up in each of the sectors?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So I mean the number I quoted on Pratt, up $35 million, was excluding pension because that we took out in the math on the good side. So the numbers that you see in the $30 million include the benefit of pension. So the Pratt number was a little north of $20 million, about $25 million increase. Otis was another $10 million or $11 million increase, and then offset by slight decrease in UTAS and CCS was flat and corporate office was down slightly. So that's the net math of $30 million.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And then quickly, it looked like F-35 engine deliveries were less than the first quarter where I would have thought they'd be ramping. So can you just talk about what's going on there?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Some of it, George, was just simply the Q4 deliveries which got pushed into January. It drove up the Q1 more than what the original schedule was. So I think it was a little bit of catch up in Q1 that you saw. Q2 is more in line with what we expected, and I think you'll see some ramp up happening in the second half. But again, the profile was not very different, it was just that Q1 was higher than originally we had expected because of just the move from Q4 to Q1.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay, thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Hayes for any closing comments.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, thank you, Karen. Thanks to all for listening today. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for follow-ups after the call. And thanks very much and have a wonderful day. Take care.", "Operator", "Thank you.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there's a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-reoccurring and/or non-operational nature often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.

You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment. I never get tired of talking to good results, but I do get tired of discussing this challenging macro environment. The good news is that we have businesses that are built to deliver in good times as well as tough times.", "So Q3 2016 adjusted EPS was $1.76, that's up 5% year over year and $14.4 billion dollars of sales, and that includes 5% of organic sales growth. That's driven by the aerospace units. So year-to-date adjusted EPS is up 6% with 3% organic sales growth.", "With three strong quarters behind us, we're going to raise the bottom end of the 2016 EPS outlook range by $0.10, that's on top of the $0.15 we raised the bottom end last quarter. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.55 to $6.60. We're also raising the low end of our organic growth outlook, and we now expect organic growth to be 2% to 3% rather than the 1% to 3% previously. We continue to expect full year sales of about $57 billion to $58 billion.", "We'll end 2016 at the high end of the EPS range that we had originally provided in December with solid organic growth, and importantly, we remain on track to our 2020 goals.", "Once again, had solid cash flow in the quarter while continuing to invest in the aerospace ramp to support future growth. Overall free cash flow was 108% of net income, with strong cash generation at each of our business units.", "These results demonstrate the positive impact from our focus on the key priorities we laid out earlier this year: flawless execution, structural cost reduction, disciplined capital allocation, and of course, innovation. And there's no better example of innovation than our Geared Turbofan Engine. The GTF is performing exceptionally well on the field. We now have eight operators flying 22 GTF-powered aircraft across the globe.", "As of last week, the GTF engines have flown over 30,000 revenue hours and more than 20,000 takeoff and landings. The GTF is experiencing 99.9% dispatch reliability on the Airbus A320neo. That's extraordinary performance for a new engine that is meeting and, in some cases, exceeding all of its key performance targets.", "VivaAerobus, which a low-cost operator from Mexico, recently took delivery of their first GTF-powered aircraft. And the final leg on the delivery flight was over 9.5 hours, the longest flight by an A320 in history, which was made possible by an 18% reduction in fuel burn for the aircraft. That is truly remarkable performance.", "The good news, of course, is the customers are excited about the engine. Our order book now stands at over 8,400 engines, positioning us for top and bottom-line growth for years to come. The issue, of course, has been that our deliveries have been slower than what we had planned. The good news is we know how to fix this. We're aggressively adding capacity, we're improving yields and perfecting processes.", "We also continue to make good progress at Otis. Our China new equipment orders and units were up 2% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. This is in the face of an overall market, which is down more than 5%. I would remind you though, the pricing pressure remains intense, so despite unit orders being up, new equipment orders on a sales basis in China were actually down 10% in the quarter. A tough market right now, but we remain focused on increasing our installed base and converting those units into our service portfolio, which will deliver recurring revenue for decades to come.", "We're also starting to see the impact from the strategies that Philippe discussed in March. We're increasing our sales force, which is helping us on the new equipment side. We're addressing product gaps through higher engineering spend. And we're leveraging the scale of Otis to reduce cost and deliver better service to our customers. But as always, more to do with Otis and across UTC.", "We also continue to focus on cost control. Nowhere is this more evident than our overall SG&A rate, which at 9.7% of sales remains the lowest in the peer group. On the capital allocation front, we just completed the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we launched last November. We continue to believe UTX is trading significantly below its intrinsic value, and we're buying back shares beyond the ASR. It's an example of our disciplined capital deployment strategy. We remain on track to return $22 billion dollars in cash to shareowners from 2015 through 2017. While big acquisitions make headlines, we believe that our disciplined approach to capital redeployment will consistently grow shareowner value for the long term.", "Okay. Let's pivot to organic sales growth. This is on slide 2. Before I talk specifics, let me just briefly talk about how the world looks from our perspective. In summary, no major change in trends that we've seen from the second quarter and largely in line what we had planned for the year. While the U.S. economic indicators remain mixed, we continue to see strength in most of our U.S. end markets.", "In Europe, we have seen a slowdown in construction activity in the U.K., we think as a result of the Brexit vote, but the rest of Europe appears to be improving slowly, more than compensating for the slowdown in the U.K.", "Middle East projects remain under pressure as you would expect, but Asia excluding China continues to see robust growth.", "Our commercial businesses saw strong growth in the Americas driven by Otis, which was up 9%, which is consistent with first half performance. Sales at CCS were also up, and that was driven primarily by continued strength in the residential HVAC business. In Europe and the Middle East, sales were down slightly, largely from the commercial HVAC business in the Middle East, which was down almost 25%.", "For Asia, overall sales were down 3%, and of course, that was driven by Otis new equipment sales in China.", "Aerospace markets remain resilient. The airlines are now into their 6th consecutive year of profitability, and traffic growth remains ahead of long-term trends, and airframers continue to have years of backlog, particularly for the new, more fuel-efficient aircraft in the narrow-body space, where we have great content.", "In the third quarter, our aero OEM businesses, both commercial and military, saw very good growth, although that's partially due to an easier compare from the challenges we had last year with the new logistics center startup. At Pratt & Whitney, both military and commercial aftermarkets were strong in the quarter.", "With that, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the details.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Greg. Before I start, just a quick note. I'd like to welcome Carroll Lane as the new Head of Investor Relations at UTC. Carroll joins us from Pratt, where he was most recently a vice president at the large commercial engine aftermarket business. Paul Lundstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity as the CFO of a public company on the West Coast, and we thank him for his many years of service at UTC.", "Moving to slide 3, total reported sales of $14.4 billion were up 4% versus the prior year and included 5% organic growth, offset by 1 point of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up 5%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.74, up 8% and included $0.02 of restructuring and other significant items.", "As you have seen in our press release tables, included in the $0.02 is the provision for ongoing customer contract negotiations at Pratt, largely offset by a benefit from the conclusion of a tax settlement. As Greg mentioned, we had another strong quarter of free cash flow, which was 108% of net income. Year-to-date, free cash flow to net income is a solid 86%. As we have said before, due to continuing investments in the aero ramp, we will likely be towards the lower end of the 90% to 100% free cash flow to net income guidance range for the full year.", "We have high confidence in our increased EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.60. With three quarters of strong performance behind us, we have narrowed the earnings range for our business units. Collectively, Otis, CCS and UTC Aerospace Systems should generate around $40 million higher earnings at the new midpoint, and we expect an additional $20 million benefit from corporate expenses and eliminations from what we were thinking before. These high expectations will be offset by Pratt & Whitney, where we expect full-year earnings to be between $1.715 billion and a $1.775 billion. The reduction in Pratt expectations was largely driven by higher E&D spend and lower margins on legacy engine fleet management contracts. This was partially offset by contribution from higher commercial transaction aftermarket and lower net negative engine margin.", "We are still in the middle of our planning process for 2017 and will give specific guidance later. However, there are two points I'd like you to understand. First, even with some recent improvements at current discount rates, pension looks to be a headwind of around $200 million in 2017; about half of that at Pratt. Second, as we more than double the GTF deliveries in 2017, we anticipate negative engine margin to increase by over $300 million year-over-year from approximately $650 million in 2016. We anticipate an additional $100 million of negative engine margin headwind in 2018 and continue to expect negative engine margin to level off at roughly $1 billion level at Pratt large commercial engines.", "But this is all part of the near-term investment necessary to return Pratt & Whitney to a leadership position in the commercial engine narrow-body segment. The offsets to negative engine margins through 2020 are still intact. E&D will come down. Pratt Canada and military engine business will grow. And net commercial aftermarket will increase.", "However, these offsets are unlikely to be a significant factor in 2017. As a result, Pratt earnings will decline next year. We are actively looking to reduce our pension exposure. You saw earlier this month that we took a couple of measures to reduce our liabilities by approximately $2 billion or 6%. These moves will generate significant economic savings and reduce our exposure going forward. Due to these actions, however, we will take a noncash settlement charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million in the fourth quarter.", "We should also see the benefit of lower share count in 2017 net of higher interest expense and CCS should deliver solid earnings growth even in the face of slow macro environment and the absence of commodities tailwind. However, net-net, it is difficult to see earnings growth at UTC level in 2017.", "As we have consistently said, our aerospace units have captured significantly higher content on new platforms, which results in higher-than-normal E&D upfront and low to negative margins on original equipment deliveries. But we also know this content will generate very profitable aftermarket over time, and cost reduction will improve margins on new products sequentially year-after-year. In other words, this short-term pain will deliver very attractive returns over the long term.", "With that, let me go through the business unit results for a very solid third quarter. Turning to Otis on slide 4, I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there is an appendix on slide 12 with additional segment data as a reference. In the quarter, Otis sales were $3 billion, flat to prior year at constant currency. Profit at $594 million was down 9% at constant currency. Contributions from higher service volume, improved productivity and lower commodity costs were more than offset by continuing price pressure in China and EMEA, additional E&D investments, and the absence of prior-year favorable mark-to-market foreign exchange adjustments.", "Foreign exchange translation was a 1-point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales were down 2% driven by a 13% decline in China. We continue to see strong growth in North America with new corporate sales up 21%, and this is on top of over 40% growth in Q3 of 2015.", "Service sales were up 3%, with continued solid growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up slightly.", "New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter and up 8% outside of China. Orders in EMEA were up over 20% with broad-based growth. In Asia outside of China, new equipment orders were up double digits while orders in North America were up slightly, even off a very tough compare. Remember that last year in Q3, we had the Hudson Yards order, the largest private real estate development ever in the U.S. So, with three quarters behind us, we feel comfortable raising the bottom end of Otis profit guidance and now expect profit to be down $150 million to $175 million at actual FX, up from the already increased guidance of down $150 million to $200 million.", "On slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 4% at constant currency, all due to acquisitions. Profits were up 7% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter, primarily due to the continuing weakness in transport refrigeration. That was down 8% year over year. North America Residential HVAC, as Greg said, was up mid-single digit.", "CCS delivered solid profit growth from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. This quarter represented the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating profit growth at CCS.", "Total equipment orders at CCS were flat, an improvement from the trend we saw in the first half. The transport refrigeration equipment market continues to be under pressure from low freight rates and a declining North America truck trailer refrigeration market after several years of robust growth. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were down low single digit, driven by the Middle East, which was down about 40%. However, we saw strong growth in the Americas, where commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 10% on top of high-single-digit growth the prior year.", "Residential HVAC continued to be robust with equipment orders up 11%. For the full year, we now expect organic sales to be flat at CCS. However, we are increasing the bottom end of the profit range and expect to deliver operating profit growth of $125 million to $150 million, up from the $100 million to $150 million at actual FX previously.", "Turning to aerospace on slide 6, Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 13% organically. This was partially driven by a year-over-year increase in large engine deliveries. As you'll recall, we experienced delays in engine deliveries in Q3 of last year due to the startup challenges we experienced at the new logistic center.", "Throughout the third quarter, Pratt has delivered 76 GTF engines across all platforms. We continue to expect to deliver approximately 150 engines this year. Pratt also saw strong aftermarket growth in both commercial and military. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% despite a 5-point headwind from the absence of last year's favorable customer contract settlements. Military aftermarket saw growth across all the engine models.", "Pratt & Whitney operating profit at $414 million was down 6%. Pratt benefited from higher commercial and military aftermarket as well as favorable pension and FX. These tailwinds were more than offset by lower Pratt Canada OE drop-through, additional ramp-related costs, higher E&D expenses and a $0.04 headwind from the absence of last year's contract settlements. For the full year, based on the factors I described before, we now expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $150 million at Pratt & Whitney, revised from the prior guidance of down $50 million to $100 million.", "At Aerospace Systems, on slide 7, operating profit increased 4% on 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial original equipment which was up 17%, off of an easy compare and accelerating growth on next generation platforms. Commercial aftermarket volumes were up 2%. As you may recall, last year's sales included a customer contract closeout. Excluding that benefit, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%.", "The military business was down 6%. The low-teens decline in military aftermarket was driven by the completion of C-5 nacelle retrofit program that we have talked about before. This happened at the end of the first quarter. Military OE sales were impacted by lower legacy programs.", "Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost reduction progress, pension tailwind and approximately $0.02 from the gain of the sale of a non-core asset. This was partially offset by lower military volumes and the absence of prior year's contract adjustments and license agreements. With solid year-to-date execution, we have raised the low end of the Aerospace Systems' operating profit range. We now expect full-year operating profit to be flat to down $25 million from the prior expectations of flat to down $50 million.", "With that, let me turn it back to Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Akhil. So overall, very good performance in the quarter and a strong year so far. And while we're addressing some near-term challenges with the GTF production ramp up, our Pratt Canada and Pratt Military businesses continue to perform well.", "We've also seen solid performance out of our UTC Aerospace Systems business, Otis and CCS; all of these guys picking up the slack. In the end, balance still works at UTC. I'm very confident about our updated guidance of $6.55 to $6.60 as well as UTC's long-term outlook. We've got a growing aero backlog and we continue to invest in all of our businesses. And the entire organization remains focused on our four key priorities: flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation.", "We've got a great portfolio of four franchises with global scale and resilient business models. And all these businesses are supported by solid market fundamentals, growing revenue passenger miles, continued urbanization and a middle-class expansion globally. All of these things position UTC to deliver earnings growth well into the future and to create significant shareowner value.", "With that, let me go ahead and open up the call for questions. Karen?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question for today comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "The color on the OE losses at Pratt is very helpful. A topic comes up a lot with investors is the market is not doing a very good job of valuing these initial losses. The billion dollars is probably carrying a negative value right now. So, I know you've addressed this in the past, Greg, but how long are you prepared to carry this kind of multiple given that the market can't value the Pratt losses? It doesn't seem to do a very good job valuing its losses. I mean, how long are you prepared to suffer a discount before you think about maybe something structural on the portfolio?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, let's not go there quite so quickly, Nigel. Let me say, look, the negative engine margin is not a new issue with Pratt & Whitney. We've been talking about this kind of billion-dollar peak of negative engine margin in 2018. And clearly, next year will be the biggest challenge as production ramps up significantly, even from this year's level. So, as Akhil said, there's about $300 million of additional negative engine margin out there.", "I think once we start delivering at a regular cadence on the GTF, people will start to understand that the GTF really will deliver long-term value. And I think today, there's a lot of show-me out there, and quite frankly, we haven't performed this year as well as I would've liked to have seen in terms of deliveries, but it's going to get fixed and it's going to be fixed this quarter. It's going to get better next year and continue to get better.", "And so, I think, I'm not going to worry so much about the multiple. People will eventually understand that the GTF truly is game-changing technology. And if you talk to the customers, what you're going to see is they love this engine. They love the take-off power. They love the noise. And it's environmentally friendly. All the things that we set out to do with this engine are on track.", "As far as portfolio, look, we will always look at what's best for the shareowners over the long term. I would tell you right now, keeping the businesses together makes a lot of sense in terms of supporting some of these losses on the aerospace side with some of the \u2013 the goodness out of the commercial is certainly helpful. But portfolio is always something we look at. Right now, we're focused on continuing to buy back shares. It's the right thing to do. We're trading significantly below intrinsic value as I'm sure you guys know. So a little frustrating, but its okay. It's a long-term story here.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "We have $22 billion that we're returning to shareholders over three years, Nigel. I think that clearly says a lot about us putting our money where our mouth is and believing fully in the intrinsic value of the company. $16 billion of share buyback over three years, that's a lot for a company our size.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Absolutely. And the point I was trying to make was the \u2013 some of the parts' discounts is the widest that we see across our coverage. So, it's more of a friendly question than anything else.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "It just means a lots more opportunity for growth at UTX, right? That's what it says.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Absolutely.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "That sooner or later, the market catches up with reality.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Let's hope so. But the math you just gave, Akhil, and this is my last question, how does that change under IFRS 15, the new revenue accounting standards?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, I think the change \u2013 there will be a little bit of impact from that as we go through the adoption of the new revenue standard. The biggest impact would probably be in the form of \u2013 as you know, we are doing excess over average over a contract value of the engines, which means there is a little bit of the cost which is being put on the balance sheet, that will probably get flushed out on 1/1/18. Beyond that, we don't expect a huge amount of change because our accounting, as we have discussed before, on negative engine margin does not change under the new rules. We also have a little bit of adjustment from the POC adoption of the \u2013 the percentage of completion as opposed to completed contracts. We'll give you an update on all that as we go through the next year and come up with more precise numbers.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, there will be some E&D that might get capitalized as well. I would just say, there's generally \u2013 there's not going to be a big, big impact from the rev rec standard. Although there will be a lot of work to do, not a huge impact. And we'll lay all that out when we put the K out early next year.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Nigel.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "A quick clarification on something you said Akhil and a question. The first on the \u2013 I think you said lower margins on legacy fleet management contracts. Did you \u2013 do you lower the profit rates on a particular program due to experience on the overhaul costs or any of that? I just wanted to clarify that. And then I wondered if you could help us a little bit with the EBIT bridge at Pratt in terms of \u2013 it looks like there's probably $100 million, $150 million of kind of holistic GTF year-over-year headwind there. How much of that would you say is real negative engine margin versus maybe sort of extra cost that we might call one-time versus E&D? Any color you can give us there?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Sure. So two separate questions. On the second one first, the bridge for full-year guidance for Pratt is as follows: The changes that we made to the latest guidance had two elements of good news.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Oh, no, I was talking about the quarter.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Oh, just for the quarter? Okay. So there also, there is a couple of pieces, things moving. We had good news in the form of higher commercial aftermarket. So that was about $70 million year-over-year, which was offset partly about $50 million from the contract settlements that we had last year, so net benefit in commercial aftermarket of about $20 million. We had good news on pension and FX. That's about $60 million year-over-year, good news. So that's together, $80 million. And then on the negative side, E&D was up about $30 million, and then Pratt Canada and the GTF startup costs were about $80 million. So that's the net math, Carter, to explain the quarter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And on the booking rates on the legacy FMPs?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So on the FMPs, the change is essentially with regard to our V2500 engine program, and that's the good news that we are seeing on the transactional side. To some extent, its being driven by the service bulletin that had come out, which was on the hub deck we had talked about before. That unfortunately has a negative impact on our \u2013 on the engines under fleet management program. So it's just the other side of the good news that we are seeing on transaction spares, and that's basically what is being deflected in the full-year guidance.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So, slight reduction there. Not much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Doug.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "You're talking about delivering 350 to 400 of your Turbofans next year. Can you talk a little about the approach you're taking to improve the yield and speed the blade production process? And how do you expect the cadence of the deliveries to move as you address the fan blade production issues?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Doug, it's a great question, and it's probably the key to fourth quarter, as well as the key to next year, is to improve fan blade production. Let me just put it in perspective for you. At the beginning of the year, the total lead time on a fan blade was about 100 days to 105 days, that is from the time we would start it to the time we got it all the way through the test process, it was taking more than three months. And frankly, our first pass test yield, that is from the number of units or fan blades that were coming out of the end of the process that were acceptable, was about 30%. Today, that 100 days to 105 days is down to 55 days with lead time. So that has been a big, big benefit to us in terms of throughput in the factories.", "We've also seen first pass test yield going up to about 75%. We're continuing to automate. We're continuing to improve the processes out in Lansing. The team has done a great job. This is a brand new, as you guys know, it's a titanium aluminum fan blade, never been used before. We'll get there.", "I think two things to keep in mind is we're going to get significant additional capacity. One of our partners, IHI, will be coming online here in November with additional capacity. They'll start delivering fan blades at full rate production, we think, in January.", "We're also standing up a brand new factory about four miles away from the current factory in Lansing, which will be mostly automated processes. That will start in full rate production in April. So between the process improvements, the yield improvements, the lead time reductions and the additional capacity, you're going to see step changes in fan blade deliveries early through the first half of next year.", "And just, again, to put this in perspective, this is a \u2013 the first time that anyone has ever built one of these ti-aluminum blades, and it was a learning process more difficult than what we had anticipated. But if I go back to 1994, for those of you that have been following the company for a long time, you will remember we had the same issue when we built the hollow titanium fan blade for the PW4000. And we had the same yield issues. We had the same producibility issues. And today, it's not an issue at all. We stamp them out, I wouldn't say on a regular basis, but we still make them much more efficiently than we initially did, and it will be the same on this fan blade. So confident we're going to get there. We're on top of this. We're following production yields on a, I hate to say this, a daily basis, but we're following it. And I'm encouraged by the progress the Pratt team has made.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "And then earlier, about a month ago, you had said that you had five critical parts that you were concerned about in the supply chain. When you look at those, are those things that when the blade issue is resolved, would you expect those to have any additional impact on delivery timing?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "So we have line of sight to complete engine builds for this year, well beyond the 150. The pacing item this year is going to be fan blades. There is a couple of other critical parts that we continue to work with the suppliers on, where we have seen yields improving. We've seen added capacity, and we're out adding additional capacity to try and make up some of the slack. So I would think we have the right processes in place in the supply chain to ensure we've got all those parts. It's one of these things where as long as there's no surprises at a supplier, we're going to be just fine. But as you know, we've also put in place, a strategy where we have no single point of failure in the supply chain. So we've got two key suppliers for each of the key parts of the GTF.", "I also talked about we have added capacity. We're perfecting processes. We also brought back Shane Eddy, who'll be leading the operations at Pratt. Shane joins us from GE, but more recently, he was at Sikorsky as Head of Operations. So I think Shane and the whole team over at Pratt will get their arms around this, and we're highly confident in the outlook for next year.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.", "Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. I just wanted to ask what impact you guys are expecting from the recently passed Montreal Protocol amendment in relation to refrigerants. And, for example, like any products redesigns that could happen as a result of this and when they might go to market? Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, Andrew, I think it's \u2013 we have been obviously working with the regulatory authorities on the changes required by the Montreal Protocol. We are in the process of redesigning several of the systems. I think the good news is we're actually ahead of the curve on our commercial refrigeration systems, on our transport refrigeration systems. We actually offer a CO2 based coolant solution, which has got a zero-goal global warming potential. So we're on top of this.", "I think the one issue that you've got with this additional or some of these new refrigerants will be cost, which is always a challenge in terms of trying to pass that on. But from a design standpoint, from a market standpoint, I would say that the team \u2013 and we just completed a technology review with the Carrier folks a couple of weeks ago \u2013 they are on top of this from what needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint.", "Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Got it. Thank you. And just as my quick follow-up, do you \u2013 can you update on the contingency that's in the guidance? I think as of last quarter, you guys sized it at $75 million?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Now that we've raised the bottom end of the range by $0.10, Andrew, the contingency is about $25 million essentially because the business units' net-net are about the same.", "Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right. Great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much. So Akhil indicated the large uptick in Pratt's new engine loss next year and kind of reiterated \u2013 you've made this point, Greg, of the challenging EBIT outlook. But a two-part question, A, with the lower share count and other factors, do you foresee any EPS growth next year with those pluses offsetting the challenges to EBIT? And secondly, given it looks like you're going to have much less uptick in GTF losses in 2018, should we also anticipate a much stronger snap back in 2018?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Let me start, and I'll let Akhil bail me out at the end. Right now, as we look at Pratt, we want to be very specific. There's $300 million of additional negative engine margin on top of probably $100 million or half of that pension headwind that Akhil mentioned. So a $400 million headwind. It's just hard to see even with better after market next year and better military, hard to see how Pratt's going to grow earnings. So we actually expect them to be down.", "E&D, I think, is the other challenge at Pratt, where we had expected it to be down next year. With the timing of all these programs moving to the left a little bit, we're continuing to see pressure on E&D. So that's one of the offsets that we're just not going to see until probably 2018 and 2019 is E&D.", "As far as overall UTC, again, this is \u2013 we're not quite ready to give guidance. As you can imagine, we're still going through the detail of the plans from all of the units and there's a lot of moving pieces. Clearly, we're going to get a benefit from share buyback, but it's probably not going to offset the negative margin, the negative engine margin and the big pension headwind that we have. And I think that's why as we look at it today, it's hard to paint a picture where we can see earnings growth at UTC next year.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Right. And my comment, Cai, was about EPS, not so much just about segment EBIT, because obviously, with the pension of $200 million, the negative engine margin Greg talked about, keep in mind, the interest expense will be higher next year by about $100 million as well just based on the fact that we need to be in the market to borrow money to fund the share buyback. So even the share buyback will be a significant benefit year-over-year. In terms of lower share count, we will lose some of that through higher interest expense.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And then the second part of the question, 2018?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "My crystal ball gets really cloudy beyond about six months. I would tell you, Cai, we're on track for what we laid out for the 2020 goals, which would show profitability starting to improve in 2018 and 2019. And as you know, the first aftermarket or first big overhauls on the GTF around 2020. So this \u2013 we expect earnings growth to pick up in 2018. I'm not going to give you a number here, but clearly, with the Aerospace ramp continuing, there's going to be some challenges, negative engine margin and the mix at UTAS, but those things should be overcome by lower E&D and higher aftermarket, as well as growth on the commercial side.", "Keep in mind, on the Otis side, we're also going to be investing for the next couple of years. Philippe has laid out a plan to restore some growth to Otis' top-line growth. That's going to require some investment in the sales force. It's going to require some significant investment in E&D to refresh the product line. And from a systems standpoint, we need to spend money on these digital initiatives. So there is going to be headwind next year beyond just what we've laid out. All of those things would start to pay off in 2018 and 2019. So again, not trying to surprise anybody with a 2017 outlook, but we are on track to exactly what we talked about back in March about the 2020 outlook.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Cai.", "Operator", "Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "If I could throw a two-parter out there also. Just back to GTF, just a little bit of pause on my part, just thinking about only $100 million delta in the headwind in 2018 relative to 2017, given the further volume ramp that you have. So if you could address that, must be around learning curve and other things, but anything you could provide there? And I was also just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on working capital and cash flow into next year. It sounds look you might be building engines in front of fan blade deliveries, et cetera. Just wondering if that puts any inordinate pressure on the cash flows.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Great questions, Jeff. So on the first one, the math for 2018 is there is growth in the negative engine margin on GTFs, clearly, but that they will benefit from us coming down the cost curve. But the fact which you may not be thinking is that the CEO engines or the V2500s will be coming down significantly from 2017 to 2018, as will be the GP7000s. And both of those carry negative engine margin as well. So while GTF will grow, the others will come down. And that's not something that's happening in 2017 as much. So that's the other fact which will keep the incremental GTF negative engine \u2013 incremental negative engine margin at Pratt within the $100 million range.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "On the second question on working capital, again, I think we've been very clear about this. There is probably a year or two years more as we ramp up, as we take the engine productions up at Pratt net-net. There is going to be demand on inventories. We will continue to see some improvement as the supply chain stabilizes and inventory turns, but in absolute dollars, there will be some demand on that as there will be demand on CapEx for another year or two years, where we will probably spend significantly ahead of our depreciation. But after that, we start to feel we're back to the 100% of net income or more.", "The fundamental thing, Jeff, to keep in mind is that each and every one of our business units has the structure to deliver 100% or more free cash flow to net income. It's just this temporary phase of significant investment we are making to meet production requirements coming up, and that's keeping some pressure on it. Otherwise, we are in very good shape. I mean 90% are closed there about this year, about 100% last year in face of these investments is not a bad number.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "No, indeed. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much. I'll try the same two-part. One on North American Residential, you had very solid numbers. Could you talk about some of the characteristics and what you think you in terms of is driving the market and the sustainability of that demand?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "You had a second part too, Howard, or are we just...", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Oh, yeah, the second part \u2013 and the second part. Yeah, thanks. Greg, it's a little bit more structural cost reduction that you're talking about. And could you \u2013 you talked about it philosophically, could you provide some other examples of it and how you think about that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. Sure. Well, let me start out with the North American Residential, obviously, it was a good year. It's interesting, the weather was very hot throughout the summer, and yet, we really didn't see much traction in Residential until September when the dealers were forced to restock inventory. So it was a good quarter, but I think there's still some concern out there about the legs lefts in the housing market. As we look at it, household formation continues to be very, very strong at about 1.2 million a year. That's going to grow. If you think about 1.2 million housing starts, 20%, 25% of the Resi business is for new construction, and I think that should remain on track.", "I think more importantly, it's the aging of the installed business out there that is going to really drive growth. There's over 100 million split systems installed in the U.S., the average life is somewhere between 10 years and 15 years, depending upon where you live and how much you use the equipment. And that is, again, the big increases that we saw back in the early 2004/2005 when we were selling \u2013 the market was 7.5 million units a year. Those units are approaching the end of their useful life. So I think we should continue to see well above GDP growth in Resi for a couple of more years here. So I'm not at all discouraged there. I think it's just \u2013 it's a really \u2013 a very good place. We've got great products, very high efficiencies systems, and there is a big push, I think, to continue to gain share there.", "As far as the structural cost reduction, Howard, there's always things to do. I think Dave Gitlin and the team down at the Aerospace Systems business in Charlotte have been focused on it. Yeah, I'm reminded, since we acquired Goodrich back in 2012, four years ago, we've realized about 600 million of synergies. We've closed more than 30 factories. There are still more factory consolidations to come.", "I think there's also structural cost opportunities in the aftermarket down at the Aerospace Systems business. We have a very large number of overhaul repair shops around the world. I think Dave's working on opportunities there. So more to do at Aerospace Systems. Clearly, Bob McDonough and team are looking at ways to continue to reduce cost in the very competitive markets that we are. Probably no more big plank closings there, but still executing on what they've got out there already.", "And the same is true on Otis. There's \u2013 I think they consolidated their engineering footprint to three major engineering centers from over 15 today. That will help reduce structural costs. We're also focusing on trying to consolidate the service supply chain. We've got over 60,000 suppliers in Otis service network. And there's a huge opportunity there to reduce costs structurally.", "So the one place I'm not going to be reducing structure is probably Pratt over the next couple of years. They've done a heck of a job over the last six years or seven years taking overhead costs out. Their SG&A is like 5%. So right now, for Pratt, it's about probably adding capacity. But we're going to continue to look for ways to take costs out everywhere, from the corporate office, to the aftermarket, to the supply chain.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Noah.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Morning", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Could you guys provide a little bit more detail on what you saw in the aerospace aftermarket in the quarter? It seems like the discussion around airline inventory pulling and used parts sales that had been headwinds has kind of faded. Curious if that's actually faded in your business. And any ability to sort of speak to what the growth rates were excluding anything you'd consider to be kind of non-reoccurring, whether it's provisioning or year-over-year comps or anything like that?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Sure, Noah. So I think the reported numbers would say UTAS commercial aftermarket grew by about 2%. But we had the benefit of four points from last year's contract closeouts. So I think the trend rate would be about 6%, which seems more in line with the normal world. We have always said that the long-term growth rate for commercial aftermarket in the UTC Aerospace Systems business should be mid-single digit, and this quarter felt like that. There was some benefits in provisioning that we saw with some new programs coming in, but that's in the range of a point or so. So I think I would say a very normal type of a quarter. The trends seem reasonably okay and good. Obviously, for the full year, we are expecting low-single-digit growth at UTAS, and we still feel comfortable with that.", "On the Pratt side, a lot of the growth has been coming on the V2500 engine. As we have talked about before, there are two factors driving it, one is the service bulletin, but more importantly, it is about time now that the first overhauls for the V2500 select five engines start to come in. We have seen the average age of a V2500 at about eight years, and 50% of those engines had not come for overhaul, so they are starting to come into the shops now, which is helping on the commercial aftermarket there. I think overall, I would say it's sort of a normal, what you would expect kind of a trend in commercial aftermarket.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Noah.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Noah.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So it basically sounds like Pratt is essentially down $400 million kind of full stop. And I guess if that's the case, and you have a little bit of extra pension going against you, will you guys kind of do your normal contingency and stuff like that? I mean, why wouldn't the high end of \u2013 it's kind of \u2013 with that profile, it's kind of tough to get to even a high end of the range in EPS that's above flat. I'm just trying \u2013 it just seems like there's the magnitude of headwinds now is you know pretty dramatic to overcome even at the high end of range.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, let's start with Pratt, Steve. And again, not to be more specific than we already have been, there is $400 million of headwind, but there will be growth in some of the other parts of the business to offset some of that for \u2013 at Pratt specifically. So we're not just going to mail in Pratt and say they're going to be down $400 million to start. We've got work to do there, and we'll continue to work through the end of the year to make sure we've wrung out every penny we can in terms of their forecast for next year.", "The other headwind, the pension headwind is real, but it's real today. We'll have to see where rates are at the end of the year. It moves us around a lot, as you can imagine. Obviously, this pension transaction that we did earlier this quarter is just our way to start trying to reduce that big liability that we got out there. We've got $1.7 billion off the books. But as I say, there's more to come there. I think we're going to continue to look for ways to immunize the plan to try to avoid some of the pressure that the interest rates put on us.", "And interest rates is not just pension. It's all the other long-term liabilities also and costs. So we've got a long way to go on the plan. Clearly, we're going to see \u2013 we should see growth at CCS. We're pushing, obviously, the Aerospace Systems business to grow. They're going to have pension headwind though as well. And Otis, again, probably a tough year next year as we continue to invest in E&D and systems and all that, but we'll see. We're going to get benefits out of share count. We'll see. I think there's just a lot of moving pieces yet.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "And, Steve, we generally have this specific discussion later in the year, and we will still have that. We are in the middle of our planning process right now. So I won't necessarily make a comment on where the high end of the range would be, but I can tell you that definitely, we would like to have a contingency because I think that plays well for us. Bad things do happen in the year, and we just want to make sure we don't surprise the investors in any way.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "No, no. I think that's smart, too, obviously. I'm just kind of like adding up all these \u2013 you've kind of highlighted $700 million of \u2013 or $0.70 of kind of year-over-year headwinds, and it just doesn't seem like there's a lot of good guys out there. So just wanted to make sure that I was kind of not missing any kind of major good guy moving parts. What was the revenue adjustment at Pratt & Whitney in the quarter? Some contract \u2013 customer contract adjustments or something?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "It's also part of that ongoing customer contract negotiations, Steve. So that's pretty normal for us to see that, where the sales adjustment comes as part of the collaboration accounting that happens on the risk revenue sharing partners.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then one last question. Just what's the delivery forecast for GTF next year? Units?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "So, I won't give you a specific number. I will tell you that we expect more than double. So probably north of 300 units, 350 units.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, I was wondering if I could follow up on Pratt for a second. So the implied margin rebound in the fourth quarter, a couple hundred basis points plus given you'll be delivering more GTFs. Just kind of what's giving you confidence that you can get out of the 11s you've been putting up for the last few?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, I think you're right about the negative engine margin. I'm not sure how you are calculating the fourth quarter margin rate.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Down low-single digits \u2013 I'm sorry, up low-single digits for sales?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then fourth quarter implied, $470 million of EBIT?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Right. Right.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "There is \u2013 yeah, we can talk more offline, Myles, on that one, but I think there is \u2013 I mean, I \u2013 you know the factors which are going to impact Pratt in the fourth quarter. The negative engine margin is one. We don't see E&D coming down that much in the fourth quarter. There is obviously some benefit at Pratt Canada. We continue to see FX good news, pension good news. Net-net, the math would get you to the fourth quarter number, which is easy to calculate now.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "All right. And then the only other one, Akhil, a clarification on the pension. So $200 million of a headwind, is that a headwind net of the $150 million that pension was supposed to decline in 2017, so it's only a...", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Right. No, it is net, Myles. It was supposed to decline by $100 million, not $150 million. I think we talked about that before. So this is the net because just the discount rate change in U.K. and U.S. is pretty significant, as you know, right? It's not just U.S., the U.K. has seen significant reduction in discount rates as well, and we have a pretty significant pension liability in U.K. markets as well. So it's a combination of that. The $200 million is the net number based on discount rates today. As Greg said, that can change again depending on what happens with the Fed and what happens on December 31.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning, Akhil. I was looking for a bit of an update at Otis on the price actions you've taken, where you think we are, how more there is to go, and what impact, Greg, you think you've seen on market share as a result. Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So in terms of market share, the key thing, David, there is \u2013 the biggest market, as you know, is China. We see China has about 50% of the new equipment market still. In terms of units, it's even larger. And there \u2013 based on the data that we have talked about for the three quarters, our unit orders have been up 3%, where we firmly believe the market has been down 5% or more. So clearly, we're seeing some benefits in the market share on \u2013 in the China business.", "I would say even though the data is not quite there from industry overall, but given the strength we have been seeing in our orders in Americas, we have been doing extremely well there, and I would venture that we are gaining significant share in Americas. And then in Europe, the order rates of up 21% this quarter would suggest that, again, we are probably doing better than market. So net-net, the initiatives that Philippe has laid out, particularly on the new equipment side, are starting to show up this year.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "And just to follow up, in terms of further price actions, how much more do you think there is to go, I guess, thinking about 2017 relative to 2016?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, I think pricing has been very, very difficult for the last couple of years in China. We've been talking about that. We actually started to see some stability here in the third quarter on pricing as the market continues to be relatively robust, especially in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities.", "Pricing is an issue really across the Otis portfolio, but is obviously most acute in China. U.S., I think we get \u2013 we're doing a little bit better. Pricing in Europe continues to be tough, and I think we continue to lose a little bit of pricing on the service portfolio every quarter.", "So the key for us and for Otis to turn this around is to make sure we get that service stickiness so we see the cancellation rates come down, and we also improve the productivity of the field workforce. So there's a lot to do at Otis. It's not just about pricing. There are some structural things we need to do, but I think Philippe and team are on the right track.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "And keep in mind, David, that the China team for Otis particularly is very good at taking costs out from the supply chain as well. While we see pricing pressure every year, they've also been able to extract cost reductions from supply chain. So they will continue to do that. They continue to push productivity in the factories there, and they will offset at least part of the pricing pressure that we have seen.", "Q3 pricing was not any worse than what we had seen year-to-date, so it seems to be stabilizing a little bit. Still much higher than what we saw last year, but down 7% to 9% as opposed to the 4% to 5% that we used to see before.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks for the color.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks a lot for squeezing me in. I guess one of my questions would be around Aerospace Systems. You gave a lot of color obviously on Pratt, the commercial OE headwind there for next year. How are you thinking about Aero Systems, particularly around the nacelle side?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So I think great question, Julian. We've got \u2013 we've always said that for Aerospace Systems, the adverse mix would be the most \u2013 the biggest headwind in 2017. It starts to become better from 2018 onwards. But the UTAS team is also working very aggressively on cost reductions. You can see it from this year's performance, they're doing extremely well with regard to the plan that they briefly (58:37) laid out. They're very much on track with it. And I think the same thing will hold for next year.", "They will be offsetting a large part of this adverse mix issue that they have with the changeover from legacy platforms to the new generation aircraft with the sort of lower margin products replacing high margin legacy products. But we do expect UTAS to do very well in terms of being able to offset a large part of that mix in 2017.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thank you. And then just my last one as I know it's running late. It's just around Otis again. The implied guidance for Q4, you've got much less of a decline in EBIT than what you've seen so far this year. Is that just a result of the easy comp because the margin last Q4 was so weak? Or do you feel that you're getting sort of around the bulk of headwinds now on E&D and re-investment in that business?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "No. I think it's more of what you said first, which is easier comps in fourth quarter. If you remember, this quarter, we had the negative adverse impact of the FX mark-to-market adjustments. Last year in fourth quarter, it had gone the other way. So therefore, we get some easier compares, which are relatively easy to forecast, and that's why we feel comfortable with the Otis guidance for the year.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "And I think just to add just a bit of color there, Julian, the fact is these fixes that we're talking about at Otis, this is nothing you're going to see come through in the P&L right away. I mean even if we improve on the new equipment side, we will put those \u2013 it takes us 18 months to install the elevators. We give free service for a year. You're really talking two years to three years out before you really start to see big traction on the new equipment side.", "Service and productivity would be a little bit faster. But again, we're making more investments than we're seeing on the productivity side initially. So a little bit of patience on the Otis side I think, but on the right track.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "All right. I want to thank everybody for listening in today. I appreciate that. As always, Akhil and the Investor Relations team will be available all day to answer your calls. I'd ask that you go easy on our new guy, Caroll Lane, as he comes up to speed, but I'm sure he's looking forward to meeting with each and every one of you. So thank you very much, and have a wonderful day. Take care.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

LLC", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies first quarter 2017 conference call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations.", "This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature, often referred to by management \"as other significant items.\"", "The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations, and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risk and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thank you, Chelsea, and good morning, everyone. United Technologies is off to a good start in 2017. Today, as you saw, we reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $1.48 and, importantly, 3% organic sales growth. All four businesses saw organic sales growth in the quarter, and orders were up impressive across all four businesses. As a result, of course, we remain confident in our 2017 expectations with sales of $57.5 billion to $59 billion, and that includes 2% to 4% organic growth and adjusted EPS, as we said earlier, $6.30 to $6.60.", "So we continue to make progress on our four strategic priorities. Those are, of course, execution; structural cost reduction; disciplined capital allocation; and, the one I'm most excited about, innovation for growth. The investments we've made in the past few years and the investments we're making today is driving organic revenue growth, and not just growth this year; it'll be growth for years to come.", "Looking at each of the businesses in the quarter, at Climate, Controls & Security, the investments in new products, and the investment in additional feet on the street, are indeed paying off. We saw 2% organic sales growth, and new equipment orders in the quarter were up 7%.", "At Otis, we continue to feel good about our overall market share. Even in China, we saw new equipment orders grow 1% in units in a still very challenging market. We also continued to make progress with our service transformation at Otis. We're on track in 2017 to provide half of our 31,000 service technicians with the digital devices, applications, and training to significantly increase their productivity. This initiative is a critical step in providing better value and quality to our service customers around the world, which will in turn improve both top and bottom line.", "On the Aerospace side, at UTC Aerospace Systems our commitment to developing aircraft systems with greater data connectivity has yielded a couple of key wins. Recently, Lufthansa Technik underwent an extensive industrywide evaluation for an aircraft interface device and selected our offering based on our ability to connect multiple data sources from the aircraft into the cockpit, a key win.", "Pratt & Whitney. We have course remain focused on the geared turbofan engine ramp and entry into service for our customers around the world. The GTF has been in operation for more than a year now and has more than 150,000 hours of passenger service. The GTF is in service at 13 operators currently flying over 100 destinations on four continents daily, providing 60% better fuel burn, 50% lower emissions, and a 75% reduction in noise footprint.", "To be fair, of course, we have had a couple of issues that we need to fix in order to improve durability on the GTF. First, let me start off by saying that we know that we've been causing our customers pain with these issues. As I said in January, they're not happy and we're not happy. The good news today is that we're well on our way to solving these early entry-into-service issues. Two weeks ago, the European regulators certified the improvement package we developed for the carbon seal issue, and it's being incorporated into engines in the field as we speak. We plan on having most of the retrofits complete by the middle of May, and all new production engines being shipped today include these upgrades. On the second issue we discussed, we expect to see upgraded combustor liners to be available in engines starting in the fourth quarter. As we've said before, neither of these are flight safety issues, and we'll continue to support operators with additional spare engines while we upgrade the fleet. The good news is, as I said, 13 operators, a little over 100 engines in service today. It's a manageable problem.", "With regard to capital allocation, we've remained disciplined. During the first quarter, we spent over $930 million on share repurchases. That's well on our way to the $3.5 billion placeholder we have for the year. We also continue to have a $1 billion to $2 billion placeholder for opportunistic M&A. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business beyond typical research and development. We're focused on new materials and manufacturing processes, which include additive manufacturing technology along with a big push into digital. We recently launched a state-of-the-art digital accelerator in Brooklyn, New York. This is a $300 million investment over several years, and it's focused on leveraging software, analytics, and the Internet of Things across our businesses to develop enhanced customer experience and product innovation, as well as to drive continued productivity.", "Let me stop there and turn it over to Akhil and to Carroll to take you through the actual business unit results. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Thank you, Greg. I'm on slide 2. So reported sales of $13.8 billion were up 3% year over year. Organic sales were also up 3%, with stronger growth across the two aerospace segments. Acquisitions benefited us by a point, largely at CCS, and that was mostly offset by FX translation headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.48 was up 1%. Reported of $1.73 had the benefit of $0.29 from the sale of our stake in Watsco that we talked about in March, and there was a press release in February. That was offset partially by $0.04 of restructuring.", "Free cash flow to net income, 48% for the quarter, in line with our expectations and ahead of prior year, especially when you take into account the fact that the Watsco transaction increased our net income by about $250 million in the quarter, but the cash that came from that transaction of roughly $450 million was reported in the investing line, so causing obviously an adverse impact to the metric. On top of that, if you add the Canadian payment of about $250 million as well, for which the net income charge was taken in Q4 of 2015, it has a reduction in the ratio. Overall, cash was exactly what we expected, and we feel very good about being able to get to our full-year guidance of 90% to 100%, although because of the Watsco transaction probably more at the lower end now.", "For the full year, we remain confident in our expectations. Q1 EPS of $1.48 adjusted was a $0.10 beat roughly versus our expectations. I would say some of that was timing. For example, at UTAS, provisioning was really strong in the quarter; it was up almost 30%, largely driving the 12% aftermarket growth. Now, as you all know, provisioning can be lumpy. We do expect full year still to be flattish, so we got some good benefit in the first quarter. Also at Pratt, negative engine margin will pick up sequentially every quarter as we have delivery ramp of GTF. And finally I think our corporate expenses will be up in the back half, including in investments in the digital accelerator that Greg talked about. So we had a really good start with Q1, feel very good about that, but it is only the first quarter of the year.", "Looking at organic growth on slide 3, global environment remains mixed. Americas remains strong. We saw improvement in Europe, but there is continued pressure in China and Middle East.", "Looking at our commercial businesses, Americas, we saw Otis up 7% in the quarter, and that's on top of 9% Q1 2016. CCS was up 3%. Within EMEA, Europe excluding Middle East was strong. Both new equipment sales and orders at Otis were up substantially. And for the first time since Q2 of 2011, service in Europe excluding Middle East was up slightly. CCS was also up in Europe excluding Middle East, driven by commercial HVAC and commercial refrigeration businesses. Middle East remained under pressure. Commercial HVAC was down over 20% in the quarter and Otis new equipment sales were down just around 40%. Asia was down 2% with continued pressure from China new equipment at Otis and the container business at CCS. For the rest of Asia, we saw good growth at both Otis and commercial HVAC.", "Within the aerospace businesses, commercial aero is up 5%, largely on the back of strong commercial aftermarket at both Pratt and UTAS. Military business was up 1%, driven by Pratt aftermarket and development revenue. Pratt OE volumes and UTAS military business were down. Q1 orders felt really good, as Greg said, particularly the strength in CCS. It is the strongest quarter of orders in over two years. We saw growth throughout the business, and Otis new equipment orders excluding China were also up 11%. So pretty good growth there. And that strength in orders gives us high confidence in the organic top-line growth and earning expectations for the year.", "With that, let me hand it over to Carroll to walk through the business units.", "Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Akhil. I'm on slide 4. I'll be speaking of the segments in constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there's an appendix on slide 13 that has additional segment data as a reference.", "Otis sales were $2.8 billion in the quarter, up 3% organically. Operating profit was down 4%. Contribution from higher volume was more than offset by continued pricing pressure in China and strategic investments in service, IT and E&D. Foreign exchange translation was a 1 point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales were up 2%. High-teen growth in Europe and low-teen growth in North America were partially offset by continued pressure in China and the Middle East. As expected, new equipment sales in China saw high-single-digit declines.", "Service sales were up 6%, including the benefit of acquisitions, with strong growth in modernization and repair. Maintenance sales were up low-single digit. New equipment orders were up 4% in the quarter. As Akhil mentioned, orders excluding China grew 11%. Otis saw order growth of nearly 30% in North America. And recall, that was on top of 33% growth in Q1 of 2016. Europe was also up nearly 30% with broad-based strength, and this is partially offset by declines in China. China was down 10% in value and declines in the Middle East, which was down more than 40%. Full-year expectations remain unchanged. We continue to expect operating profit to be down $50 million to $100 million at constant currency, with higher investments in the remaining quarters and continued pressure in China.", "Turning to slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales grew 6% at constant currency in the quarter. Operating profit was down 3%, and that included an unfavorable contract adjustment of $25 million that was recorded on a large commercial project during the quarter. FX translation was a 2 point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were up 2% in Q1, driven by mid-single-digit growth in North America HVAC with strength in both residential and commercial. Commercial refrigeration saw a mid-teen sales increase. Fire and security sales were flat. Transport refrigeration continued to experience sales weakness and was down 8%. Within transport, container was down almost 40% and North America truck trailer was down 10%.", "Total equipment orders at CCS were strong, up 7% in the quarter. Transport refrigeration orders were up 30%. That was primarily driven by North America truck trailer. With 6% growth in commercial HVAC and 8% growth in commercial refrigeration, CCS saw its highest organic order growth in a quarter since Q4 2014. Operating profit gains from organic volume were offset by the contract adjustment I mentioned earlier. Absent that adjustment, profit at CCS was flat in the quarter, including FX. CCS saw margin pressure in the quarter from lower transport refrigeration sales and unfavorable mix within fire and security and commercial refrigeration. Based on the strength in equipment orders and productivity initiatives, we remain confident in full-year expectations for CCS of operating profit up $150 million to $200 million at constant currency on low-single-digit organic growth.", "Turning to Aerospace on slide 6. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. Aftermarket sales were strong, with commercial and military each up high-single digit. Despite a tough compare in the large commercial aftermarket, higher shop visits and content on V2500 more than offset declines in legacy models. Commercial OEM saw a 4% sales growth, while military OEM was flat. Geared Turbofan shipments increased in the quarter and totaled 70 engines, and that included 26 engines to be used as spares in support of customer fleets. With additional industrial capacity being added through the year, Pratt & Whitney remains on track to build 350 to 400 GTF engines in 2017, including spares.", "Pratt operating profit of $393 million was down 5%. Headwinds included higher negative engine margin and lower OEM shipments at Pratt Canada and military. Also recall that Q1 2016 benefited from a favorable contract settlement that contributed $0.03 to earnings last year. These headwinds are partially offset by margin contributions from commercial aftermarket and FX benefit. We continue to feel confident in Pratt & Whitney full-year operating expectations of down $150 million to $200 million, including the benefit of FX.", "Turning to slide 7. Aerospace Systems reported profit of $599 million, up 9%, on $3.6 billion of sales, and included 5% organic sales growth. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2016 does offer the year's easiest compare due to the transition to a new ERP system that was implemented last year. Commercial aftermarket was up 12%, with high single digit growth in both parts and repair and nearly 30% growth in provisioning. As Akhil mentioned, provisioning did include some one-time benefits in the quarter. If you exclude these items, provisioning was up 4%. Commercial OEM sales were up 2%, while military sales were down 2%, and that military sales was against a 2016 compare that included the delivery of the final units for the C-5 nacelle retrofit program.", "Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and continued cost reduction, as partially offset by unfavorable commercial OEM mix and higher E&D. With a solid start to 2017, Aerospace Systems continues to expect operating profit to be up $50 million to $100 million for the full year.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Carroll. So I think we've said it often enough: good start to the year, confident in the full year. I'd also tell you that we're encouraged by signs of momentum in the global economy. We've seen really good strength here in the U.S. We've seen recovery in Europe. Even in China, we saw good economic growth in the first quarter, although some of the markets that we operate in remain challenging from a pricing standpoint.", "Every CEO in corporate America talks about uncertainty. I'm not so worried. The fact of the matter is we all face the same headwinds, the same uncertainty. We're going to focus on what we control, and we're going to continue to invest for the long run. I'm confident that UTC is well-positioned for the long term because each of our businesses is supported by solid long-term market fundamentals. Those fundamentals, along with innovative new products, a relentless focus on cost reduction, and our commitment to providing the best possible value to our customers is going to drive both top and bottom line growth for years to come. We're confident in the outlook not just for this year but for 2020 and beyond.", "So with that, let's open up the call for questions. Chelsea?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities", "Hi. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Morning, Julian.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities", "Just a first question \u2013 well, the main question \u2013 on CC&S. Obviously, people are very sensitive to any sense of margins plateauing in that business. So maybe you could walk through how quickly some of those issues around the unfavorable mix and the Transicold volumes \u2013 how quickly they'll reverse over the balance of this year? Is that something that can come in Q2? Or it's really a second half issue?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So, Julian, I think the 140 basis points, just to do a quick math for you first, 140 basis point decline in margin obviously on the face of it looks shocking. Half of that is just on the basis of that contract adjustment that Carroll talked about, the $25 million. 40 basis points comes from acquisitions that we did. As you know, acquisitions in the early years don't necessarily come in at the same ROS level as the existing business, but over time that improves. So we got sales with little earnings on acquisitions. That was 40 basis points.", "The mix impact was a little bit \u2013 the rest of it, right? So to give you some examples of the mix, within Fire & Security we had growth in the installation business while service business declined. That will change as the year goes by. Similarly, in the commercial refrigeration business we saw growth coming largely from new products where costs in the first quarter were not at the levels at which they will be sequentially as we go through the year. So cost reduction efforts the rest of the year will drive margins higher on these new products that have been introduced in the commercial refrigeration business.", "So we think the mix gets better. We also think the transport refrigeration business gets better. Container business was down 39% in the first quarter. We know that the refrigerator trade is growing 3% to 4% every year, so that market is going to bounce back. Our expectations now are that the market will probably be seeing some recovery in the second half. It certainly won't be down 39% for the year, so I think the mix gets better as we move through Q2 and the rest of the year.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Julian, I'd also add just two points. One, we continue to invest in R&D. R&D was up about $10 million in the quarter there, so there's a little bit of headwind there. The other thing is, we've talked about this investment in feet on the streets and additional salespeople out there to try and drive additional top line growth. You guys should be assured we haven't lost our focus on cost at CCS. Bob McDonough is \u2013 he's gating all of these head count additions to make sure that he can meet his commitments for the year. He and we remain confident in his overall guidance for the year. So, look, it was a bad first quarter, but as Akhil said, there was a couple of very specific things that caused it. Bob's got his eye on the cost line. We'll get the margins back to where you expect.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks; good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Morning, Myles.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I was wondering if I could do the same litany I guess on Otis. So it looks like services sales were up nicely in the quarter. That should've helped mix, presumably. Can you talk about the margin driver and the pressure from China? And also, how much of the $75 million year-on-year growth in R&D dropped in 1Q?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So the easy question first. I think $17 million of the $75 million was in the first quarter. That's the strategic investments in totality, but there is also the pressure that you saw last year in our booking in terms of the China new equipment ultimately translated into the earnings, as you would have expected, right? The pricing pressure from China is where essentially a lot of the margin pressure at Otis is coming from.", "If you look in totality, Myles, the first quarter in Otis was not that far off from what you expect for the full year. We do expect margins at Otis to be down this year, around 100 basis points or so, a little more than 100 basis points. And first quarter was a little worse than that, but not that much. So I wouldn't say Otis was a reason for concern. I think it's just the pressure in pricing at China that is continuing through the P&L now and will continue for a while. The move towards the lower mix as well in China, but rest of the business is performing well.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And remind me the service expectation for the year versus the new equipment expectation for the year, in terms of total sales growth.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So service we expect to be low to mid-single digit growth, and new equipment is low single digit growth. Now, in service, keep in mind \u2013 I agree with you that 6% should have given greater drop-through, but part of the service growth came from acquisitions that we did in Japan last year. And again, same phenomena, right, when you have intangibles amortization associated with new acquisitions, the drop-through is not that great. So a little bit of impact from acquisition there in Otis Japan.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Fair enough. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Greg, I wondered if you could give us some color. It looks like you recently got the number 3 bearing fix certified. I wondered if you could give us some color on the path to getting all of those retrofits done and the cost there. And then, Akhil, I wondered just in light of all this cost growth \u2013 something I know we've talked about before, but I wondered if you could give us an update \u2013 when you look at the IRR of the program, the GTF, and incorporate some of this cost growth that you've seen, does that have a material drag versus what your initial business case may have planned? Any color there would be great. Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Is that all, Carter? So let's start, I think, on the thing that's on everybody's mind and, as I mentioned before, this is the carbon seal on the number 3 bearing on the geared turbofan. Obviously, as we said back in the first quarter, it was causing the customers pain, and there was some work that we needed to do to go out and verify the engineering fix. We completed that flight testing about a month or so ago. We had the European airworthiness authorities. They approved the fix about two weeks ago now. We have all the hardware for the fix pre-positioned out in the field. We've got about 25% of the engines retrofitted today. This is a four- to five-hour retrofit; they do it on the overnights. So we expect, as I said, most of these aircraft engines will be upgraded by the middle of May. There'll be a few stragglers, but most affected populations will have it all done by the middle of May. So that's the good news.", "Look, it seemed like it took a long time, and I always tell guys around here, when we have customer problems, we look at our watch and not our calendar when we're trying to solve these things. And I would tell you, Pratt's done a pretty good job within the constraints of all of the airworthiness authorities and getting the proper testing done. But to that end we're going to continue to do additional endurance testing, working with Airbus through the back half of the year. We'll spend another $40 million or $50 million doing that testing to ensure that there's not another problem out there. We've got 150,000 or so hours on the fleet. We haven't seen any other surprises or concerns so far, but just to be cautious and to be complete, we're going to continue to do endurance testing.", "So is the problem completely behind us? Obviously not. Some of these engines, you'll still see some removals, but I'd tell you the Pratt team has jumped on this just like the combustor issue that we talked about, and we have solutions. So the good news, Carter, if you think about it, is as I said, only about 100 engines out there in service. This is not a huge cost. The cost to do the retrofits, the cost in terms of helping the airlines through some of this, it's all in Pratt's numbers already for the year. Akhil can take you through the longer-term implications, but I would tell you, again, it's not material.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. I think just as Greg said, Carter, I think the IRR still above cost of capital clearly on the GTF. The higher volumes are certainly helping the business case there. The incremental costs are very early in the program. As Greg pointed out, it's only 100-odd engines at this point which need to be retrofitted. I'd rather see these problems being discovered now than when we have 1,000 engines out in the field. But the other more encouraging part is that with all the sensors that we have put in the GTF, compared to the old conventional engines, there is so much more data that we are getting, and taking benefit of that digital effort, we would be able to be much better at predictive maintenance and, therefore, reduce the cost of maintenance over the long term. So, I don't believe that has fully been factored into the business cases as well.", "So while, yes, there have been some negatives with regard to the cost early on, there is also a huge opportunity with the digital aspect of the GTF engine that can give us some improvements versus our long-term business case.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you very much, gents.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, gents. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. So just going back to Otis, China orders down 10%, I didn't hear how that's split between units and price. If I missed it, I'm sorry, but if you could just give that data point? And down 10% versus a big pickup in residential construction in China during 1Q, so I'm just wondering, if at all, when you expect to see that uptick in activity coming through on orders?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Sure, Nigel. So, I think 1% up in units. That's more in line with the China residential activity. Unfortunately, the value doesn't necessarily represent what's happening with the market. It's the units that you have to look at. And we believe we did better than the market. The market \u2013 again, exact data is not available, but the best estimate is that first quarter was probably flat to maybe slightly down in terms of units. In terms of value, the difference still remains the same. We are seeing continuing price pressure in Otis China. Roughly half of that disconnect of 11 points was pricing, and the rest was continuing move towards the mix of lower price, lower value units being sold or being asked for by the customers. So it's \u2013 units still decent, market share gains at Otis China continuing, and the pressure's unfortunately on the negative side on pricing and/or mix continuing as well.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. So price down 5% to 6% roughly, so that's in line with your full-year plan, I think.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "On the mix side, how does the margin on \u2013 in some of these lower-end residential units, how does the margin compare on those to obviously your typical margins on residential?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So margins as a percent is relatively close, Nigel, but as you can imagine, since these are lower value, lower price overall, it hurts the margin dollars. And that's one of the issues that we have to continue to face and deal with. We keep looking for more cost opportunities out of the product through reengineering, through using alternate materials, but the commodity price increases which have been happening not just in China, but globally, are not helping that very much. So, that definitely is a negative which we continue to watch at Otis.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then a quick one as well. Just on the OE side in North America and Europe, are we seeing OE margins rising with the volumes?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "The OE margins, I would say, are \u2013 on the new equipment side, are still okay. Some of the order strength still has to flow through the sales line. The book margins seem to be consistent; in fact, slightly better than what we have seen in the past. But I would say no perceptive \u2013 no material changes.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Well, thank you very much. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about UTAS and sort of efforts to reposition the business a little bit? By that I mean, using the example of the electronic controls in the interface with the customer and avoiding some of the commodity products in the past that have given you fits on pricing?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Fits on \u2013 we'll stay away from the pricing discussion, Howard. But look, I think as you think about the Aerospace Systems business, it's obviously one of the most complicated businesses that we have. As a result, it's complicated to do business with Aerospace Systems. We have over 300,000 separate parts that we sell. And the efforts underway today are to make those transactions with our customers much more seamless. And again, that's just where digital initiative comes into play. First of all, being able to predict when parts are going to fail, being able to communicate that, having the parts available, but also having a single interface for an airline technician who's out on the line to be able to diagnose and then order, and then reinstall a part seamlessly is all part of the long-term goal of where we're going with digital here.", "So it's not something we're going to finish this year or next. It's a longer-term journey, as you can imagine the complexity of this. But they've got a good start. We talked about this $300 million investment we're making in digital. Dave Gitlin's folks will be a big part of that initially. I think they've got a very good road map in terms of where they want to be. The technology clearly exists to do all this; we just have to put it all together. I think we've got the right channel partners to do that. We've got the right folks internally to help.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Sam.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Looking at the balance sheet, and looking at the inventory growth of $680 million, I know there's always a seasonality with regards to Carrier at this point in the year, but can you just kind of help us understand what's the normal growth, and what's really extra, or excessive, because of, say, the geared turbofan issue? I'm just trying to help size the opportunity for shrinking the inventory levels.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Sam, you hit on one of the hot-button issues that we have around here, and there's no bigger sinner from an inventory standpoint, of course, than Pratt & Whitney. They got almost $4 billion of inventory today. That's up over $1 billion in the last 18 months. The good news is the parts are flowing in, engines are being built, but I think Pratt, in order to protect schedule, in order to ensure that we have all the hardware we need, they have been more aggressive in bringing parts in than we probably needed, but it's okay. That stuff will work itself out. As you think about going from 160 engines last year to 350 to 400 this year, and then doubling again next year, the inventory turns will improve, and those inventory balances, while they seem large \u2013 they'll get more in line over the next 18 months or so. CCS, the U.S. res business, obviously it's all seasonal. Inventory's up a couple of hundred million there. The other piece, of course, is at Aerospace Systems. They have some opportunities on the inventory side as well, but certainly not at the same magnitude as the engine company.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Ron.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "We've seen a nice rebound in air freight, and given the engines that Pratt has out in the field, and their exposure to that, did we see a pickup in order activity at Pratt related to that, or just broadly speaking the level of air-traffic growth that we did see so far in the first quarter of the year?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Most of those, Ron, as you can imagine, are old PW4000 engines. We did not really see a pickup there. Most of the pickup that we did see at Pratt was on V's. We continue to see again a lot of hours on the V fleet, a lot of activity there in our shops on V, but I wouldn't say we saw anything abnormal in terms of growth. The good news is as air freight does improve, that means they're putting hours on those engines, so they will come back for their normal scheduled overhaul, but that's probably 18 to 24 months out.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "The normal phenomenon, Ron, is continuing. We saw a good, high shop visits and content at V2500, but the legacy spare parts and legacy aftermarket associated PW4000 and PW2000 was down, and those trends we expect to see continue in spite of some of the other macro things that you mentioned like air freight, et cetera.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, okay. And then, Akhil, one follow-up for you. You mentioned a 40 basis point hit to margins due to some acquisitions in CCS. Can you give us more color on it? Like, what did you guys buy that would give you that kind of headwind? Because that seems a little high.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, this was basically acquisitions we did last year, Ron. I think there was a company in Europe that we bought, which was in the commercial HVAC and heating space. If you look at the appendix, you'll see that CCS had 4% benefit in their reported sales from acquisitions, and that essentially is about $150 million or so, and that comes with very little earnings to begin with. Now, those acquisitions will give us earnings as we grow, as we continue to take costs out of those, but initial amortization of the intangibles, initial margins that come in always keep pressure on any acquired entity, and we fully expect those to improve. The acquisition CARs, or our business cases, are all in double-digit IRR, so good value-creating opportunities, but the initial economics is always tough from an accounting point of view.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Noah.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "In the aerospace aftermarket, I think you said the 12% reported in UTAS was 4% excluding provisioning. Did I hear that correctly? And then I also heard high single digit in parts and repair. What's the variance between the high single digit in parts and repair and the 4% ex provisioning? And then if you could maybe just speak a little bit more qualitatively, I guess, to what you saw in the quarter. Are airlines no longer delaying shop visits? Or are you seeing less third-party parting out? Or anything that changed in terms of the trends you're seeing in the business?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So first just the reconciliation on your UTAS math. So the 12% overall commercial aftermarket growth was made up of roughly 30% on provisioning and high single digit on repair and parts. The 4% number that was quoted was just provisioning by itself, excluding some of those one-offs: a large sale of A380 landing gear, for example, or new higher engine build units than we had anticipated to support the Pratt \u2013 the neo nacelles, which go into the lease pools. So it's special exceptional items like that that drove the really exceptional growth in provisioning, which is a lumpy business, as you know. So we wanted to give you the color of 4% to make sure that you guys don't start projecting 30% growth for every quarter going forward.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I see.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So what was UTAS commercial aftermarket ex provisioning?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So ex provisioning it will be about 7% to 8%. Somewhere in that range.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. Which was still pretty good.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah, yeah.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So we feel good about things there. It's an on-condition situation, which is not so much a number of shop visits, or other. So the more flight hours are translating into better parts requirements. So that's certainly very encouraging and good. Obviously, it's just one quarter. We've got to continue to see how that trends. Our internal dialogue with Mr. Gitlin is to try and see if he can do better on his commercial aftermarket than the guidance that he gave, but obviously we'll have to see how the next few quarters play out.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much. So the 70 deliveries of the PW1000s in the first quarter, how many of those went to customers? And how many were revenue deliveries? And how many were spare engines, spare engines just so that they could keep their planes going? And maybe walk us through the expected pattern of shipments over the year and the expected build in the engines that go out for spares? Thanks.", "Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. Cai, we had 44 deliveries to customers, and we had 26 spares, which, when you think about the mix spares to deliveries, we expect obviously to shift towards deliveries as the year progresses.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. For the full year, I think we expect, Cai, a little over 50 engines to go into the spares to support the customer fleet. So this was \u2013 in conjunction with Airbus, we agreed to pull forward some of the spare engines for the entire year into first quarter so we could support the customer fleet today for the issues which we're having. Given the improvement package that Greg described, we expect the need for spares to come down a little bit as we go through the rest of the year. And so for the full year, we still expect a little over 50 going into the spare pool.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "So the 139 large-engine deliveries for the full quarter includes the 44 PW1000s?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes, yes.", "Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.", "Right, yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So just on this provisioning and kind of the aftermarket growth there, will there be any comp dynamics through the rest of the year where the aftermarket there could actually go negative? I haven't gone back to check on how that provisioning growth was over the last three quarters of last year, but just from a quarterly progression perspective?", "Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. Steve, I mean, I think if you look at the comps going forward, obviously you get tougher comps in Q3. We still feel like provisioning is likely to be flat on the year. Akhil mentioned the A380 spare landing gear. That's a big-ticket item. Don't expect it to reoccur during the year. So, yeah, to get to flat on provisioning obviously from where we're starting from, we expect some tougher comps and some lower requirements.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. And I guess we can just use this quarter's kind of influence as a base for how it would influence the total reported number at UTAS for aftermarket?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, I think \u2013 yeah, our expectation for UTAS is still to do low to mid-single digit type of growth in commercial aftermarket. I think it was originally low. We are hopeful that maybe they do a little bit better than that given the strength in the first quarter, but again, we still have to watch. As you know, 2015, everybody was a little disappointed, including us, with the fall-off we saw in provisioning in the back half of 2015, and this year I'd rather have a good quarter to begin with as opposed to relying on a heavy back half.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So, if anything, this gives us more comfort about the full-year guidance.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then in CC&S, any update to your price-cost spread there?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So I think if you \u2013 again, you've got to look at it business by business. I think in the residential side, we feel still \u2013 you know the commodity prices have been going up, and so the benefit that we expected, or most of the industry got last year from commodities, is certainly not there this year. We were sort of flattish at CCS on pure commodity. Pricing in the residential space feels okay, although the season is ahead of us, so we've still got to see what exactly happens and how the industry behaves as the season comes around. On the commercial side, pricing remains a little bit of a pressure, right? So we're still seeing more competitive pricing environment in the commercial HVAC space, not just U.S. but globally, and so that is one thing we're watching.", "So I would say net-net in our provisional road map we had probably $25 million of tailwind from price commodity. I think that probably is looking more like flattish. On the other hand, we think to compensate that we'll probably see a little higher volume than we were expecting at the beginning of the year. So I think net-net, still feel good about the guidance for CCS, but maybe a little pressure on price commodity.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is now open.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thanks.

Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, Greg, just a quick one. When we were in Florence, there was discussion in Fire & Security about modeling the oil and gas market end market flat for 2017, and it was kind of a watch item on the CapEx front. What's the latest update there? And how are you bracketing that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. I would tell you first quarter was not a great quarter in the oil and gas. I think everybody is experiencing this still with the volatility in oil price. We had some hope when we saw oil up at $60 a barrel. But when it trades below $50, I think it puts a little bit of a challenge into the plan for the year. Again, it's not a huge driver at Climate, Controls & Security, but clearly it's one of those things that Bob's got on his watch list that we have to be looking at for the rest of the year.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And what was, I guess, the planned restructuring for CCS this year?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "The plan for restructuring across all businesses collectively is about $300 million. CCS is a portion of that. I would say the largest one is UTAS, where we continue to look for continuing benefit on the footprint side. They need the cost reductions to help offset some of the mix problem that we have talked about there with the new products coming in. So CCS has a portion of that. I wouldn't like to give out an exact number on that.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Nice quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Greg, in the prepared \u2013 good morning. In the prepared remarks you guys talked about Otis Europe's service improving I think for the first time in five, six years, something like that. Can you talk about how you feel about the sustainability of that? And then a second question on GTF, specifically on the A321neo, what's going on there? I think your engine certified before the LEAP, yet the LEAP had their first delivery on the A321neo. Just what's holding up things there? Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, David. On the service side, there was very good strength in Europe, as I think Carroll pointed out in the remarks. There was good news really in repair and modernization. Those are the pieces that drove big service growth. And repair and modernization has been a little lumpy. You recall there were some programs five years ago, required upgrades that drove modernization. We'd seen a very, very low uptake there for the last couple years. So, it's encouraging to get these repair and mod jobs back in line. But having said that, even what we call our O or our basic maintenance was up in Europe. And it's market by market a little bit different, but there was strength in most of the European countries, a little bit of growth in the O. We saw some pricing stability, I would tell you, on the service side.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "In some countries, not broadly.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "In some \u2013 yeah. Right. So there's still challenges out there, as my CFO will point out here. But broadly speaking, I think the trends are encouraging in service. And as you recall, the key for the O service growth or the basic maintenance is just to get a little bit of inflation in the system, and I think we're finally starting to see that. And as unemployments come down, as the economy gets better, and quite frankly as our service quality gets better, we're starting to see a little traction there, so I think it's all very encouraging.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Then on the 321 \u2013 yeah, thanks.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. On the 321neo, nothing really to mention specifically, David. I think it's just more a function of Airbus and the customers in terms of how they want to prioritize their requirements. But our engine again continue to work as per the customer requirements. I think the big news, the good news, as Greg pointed out, is that we have the improvement package in place now, which has been approved by the regulators. So as soon as that's in the new engines and retrofitted on the existing fleet, we should start to see significant confidence.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. David, I think the real question here is are we on track to our contractual commitments to Airbus for the year for the GTF? And the answer is yes. We continue to see a path, as we said, 350 to 400 engines for the year. We should hit the delivery requirements at Airbus. How they allocate those engines, it obviously changes month to month, quarter to quarter based upon customer input, customer needs, but there's not an issue with the A321 versus the A320 or the A319.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, Jason.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Just a quick question on Otis and the longer-term margin trajectory there. I think, again, as we were down in Florence, I think one of the keys to margin expansion at the time were going to be some of these productivity tools that you're rolling out into the service area. So, can you just quickly provide us an update on the further rollout of those productivity tools? And when we should expect, here from the outside, that rollout to have a material impact on margins at Otis? Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Sure, Jason. So I think as Philippe mentioned in March, we've started the rollout. The launch country was Hong Kong, and we are seeing some really good results there. The mechanics seemed to be very excited with the new tools and everything that's going on with the new apps and everything else that comes with it to improve their productivity, and also the customer experience, by the way. As Philippe said, we have plans to get roughly half, 16,000 of our 31,000 technicians, with the new tools, followed by the remaining half in 2018. So, the impact of that obviously we expect to start to see some returns on the investments this year coming into 2018. That'll only be, for part of it, to technicians that will have the tools with them. Certainly, 2019 will be the first full year with all technicians around the world having the tools, and as we have said many times, a 1-point improvement in the productivity of the technicians can yield $30 million of benefits. So I think you'll see the real benefits starting showing up in 2019 to a full extent, and then it should only get better after that.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "That's great.

So when you look at those two businesses, what are the things that you're expecting to see that will make you confident that you're going to see that upturn in growth? Is that some specific improvements in the market? Is it market share? What should we watch for to know that it's really going to be on track to have that growth?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. Doug, a couple of different things. Obviously the dynamics of each of the businesses are different. I think what you want to look at for Otis is really what's happening with order backlog on the new equipment and the translation of that new equipment into the service portfolio. We've been very encouraged. I mean, these last couple of years we've had very, very solid new equipment growth. And as you know, that will translate into new equipment sales between six and 36 months out. We've got some of these major things that we're doing like the Willis Tower in Chicago. That's a three-year project in backlog. So I think from an Otis perspective, the metric you want to be looking at is new equipment orders.", "The other thing, of course, on Otis is all about service conversion, and we track that, as you would imagine, on a monthly basis. And as the conversion rate continues at historical levels, that will translate into sales. So Otis is the easy one because it's, I think \u2013 Philippe talks about regaining a little bit of global market share. I think we've been doing that very effectively with some of these new products that they're going to be introducing, as well as, again, a more targeted sales and marketing effort.", "On the CCS side it is, as you would expect, more market driven, but we still expect a point or so of growth from market share gains, and that's going to come from continued investment in these new products. We had 130 new products go into production this year. The pipeline remains robust within the whole Climate, Controls & Security portfolio. We're always looking for ways to upgrade the products, improve value, improve efficiency. And so that's the market share gain. I think you really need to look at market share of all of the businesses within CCS. And the thing that you can't, of course, control \u2013 when you have a container business that's down 40% because the ship owners are having a difficult go. Those things are temporary. I think you want to look at the underlying markets like for refrigerated transport, which Akhil said grows at 3.5% or 4% a year. Those things all support that 3% to 5% organic sales growth that we were expecting for CCS.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. And I would just add that, as you know, the residential market in U.S. is seeing some good strength, some solid market fundamentals, both in terms of new housing starts as well as replacement market that comes in. A large part of the installed base was created in the early 2000s, and all that 100 million of split units and 50 million of furnaces and coils are going to be replaced over the next four or five years. So as we look at the market fundamentals, they are pretty solid, and in addition with the innovative new products, we should be able to gain some share. So that's the combination.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "But I just want to make sure I understand on Otis, which makes sense that it's the more predictable one. Given that a very large portion of your OE sales are in China \u2013 you've had the pricing pressure, you've had the mix shift to lower end products. When you look at that market, how do you get comfortable about the service conversion there? I know this has been something that has been improving over time, but it seems that that would be a very important part of your scenario for 2016 to 2018 for Otis.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Doug, you're exactly right. I think what you've seen over the last three years is about 20% compound growth in the service portfolio. We've got almost 200,000 units under service today. We expect that to continue to grow kind of 10% to 15% a year, each year. And part of that is conversion, but it's also there's a large number of elevators out there that do not currently have service contracts that were out. And the key for us there is, of course, hiring enough technicians to actually do the work. That's the challenge. But, yeah, service in China will be a big driver of growth in China, but still, if you think about it, it's less than 10% of the China market for elevators is in service. So there has to be a normalization of the OE market in China as well to support that 3% to 5% because, to your point, that's still the world's biggest elevator market.", "Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Greg Hayes for any closing remarks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Chelsea. I just want to thank everybody for listening in today. As always, Carroll and team are available to answer all of your questions. And appreciate the confidence in UTX. Take care.

LLC", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the United Technologies second quarter 2017 conference call. On the call today are: Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items.", "The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself in the queue as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay, thank you, Latoya, and good morning, everyone.", "As you saw from our press release this morning, UTC reported another solid quarter. And with the strong first half behind us, we're now raising the lower end of our adjusted EPS range for the year by $0.15, to a new range of $6.45 to $6.60. Importantly, we're also raising our sales outlook in that we now expect 2017 sales of $58.5 billion to $59.5 billion. That's up from our previous expectation of about $57.5 billion to $59 billion. And we now see organic growth of 3% to 4% versus 2% to 4% on an improving macroeconomic environment.", "So we reported Q2 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.85. That's an increase of 2% over the prior year. And sales in the quarter were $15.3 billion, and that included 3% of organic sales growth. That's consistent, of course, with our first quarter. Free cash flow was robust at 118% of net income, with all of the businesses generating strong cash performance while we continued to invest to support growth for the long term.", "Right now we're focused on executing on our strategic priorities, and we're pleased with the progress we've seen in the first half of 2017, and specifically our emphasis on creating innovative products and services, which is starting to generate solid organic sales growth.", "At CCS, where we've continued to invest in new products and sales resources, organic growth was 5% in the quarter, with organic growth in the North American residential business up double digits. CCS's equipment orders grew 11%, with all of its business segments contributing in the quarter, and that follows strong new equipment orders growth of 7% in Q1.", "At Otis China, we saw orders growth of 7% in units, while the China market continues to be challenging. We'll talk more about that.", "On the Aerospace side, Pratt & Whitney sales grew 6% organically in the quarter. And Pratt of course continues to focus on execution, including the Geared Turbofan [GTF]. As Bob Leduc mentioned at the Paris Air Show, a supplier quality issue impacted some of the GTF deliveries late in the second quarter. The issues have been addressed, and we remain confident in our commitment of 350 to 400 engines for the year. In Q2, our Aerospace Systems business has expanded their operating margins by 70 basis points versus the prior year, even as the portfolio transitions to the next generation of OEM products.", "And our capital allocation remains disciplined. We still expect to spend about $3.5 billion on share repurchases this year, completing our plan to return $22 billion to shareowners between 2015 and 2017.", "On the M&A front, acquisitions we've completed at CCS and Otis last year are contributing to our growth story this year, and we continue to have a placeholder at $1 billion to $2 billion for M&A this year. But as I said before, we will be opportunistic for the right deal.", "So a solid quarter, but our focus of course is on the long term. We feel good about UTC's performance and the improved 2017 outlook. We're executing on our commitments in growing the business with innovative products and focusing on cost reduction while also being efficient and disciplined in our capital allocation.", "I'll turn it over to Akhil and Carroll to take you through the individual business unit results. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Thank you, Greg. I'm on slide two.", "So Q2 was solid. Reported sales of $15.3 billion were up 3%, 3% organic growth. One point of net acquisition benefit was offset by one point of foreign exchange headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.85 was up 2%. Reported EPS of $1.80 included $0.05 of restructuring this quarter and was up 5% on a comparable basis.", "Cash generation was also very strong. Free cash flow was 118% of net income. For the first half, free cash flow was 84% of net income, including the adverse impact from the Watsco transaction and the payment of the Canadian royalty settlement. As we have said before, we continue to expect full-year free cash flow to net income towards the lower end of the 90% to 100% range.", "On slide 3, you see on the left the trends of our organic growth over the last five quarters, and on the right-hand side you see the breakdown of the Q2 organic performance. Looking at our commercial businesses geographically, Americas remained solid. Otis sales were up 8% on top of 10% growth in last year's second quarter in the Americas. Sales at CCS were up 7%. In EMEA, sales were flattish, with slight growth in Europe offset by continued weakness in the Middle East. Asia sales were flat as well in the quarter, driven by China, which was down 10% for Otis. For rest of Asia, Otis was up low single digit and CCS high single digit.", "On the Aerospace side, Commercial Aerospace sales were down 1% in the quarter, almost counterintuitive, right, as strong growth in the aftermarket businesses at both Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems was more than offset by a contraction in OEM sales. UTAS commercial OEM sales were down 8%, driven by 777 landing gear resourcing and legacy program rate reductions. Pratt Canada OE engine shipments were also down 19%, driven by the helicopter and general aviation end markets. Year to date, Commercial Aerospace sales were up 2%.", "Military sales were very strong, up 30% at Pratt & Whitney and 5% at Aerospace Systems.", "The continuing strength in orders at our commercial business units that Greg mentioned and solid aerospace backlog gives us confidence in increasing our organic growth expectation for 2017 and the low end of the EPS range. That said, unlike in prior years, EPS in the second half will be lower than the strong first half. Segment operating profits will be up $0.12 to $0.15 sequentially in spite of higher negative engine margin in the second half. However, higher interest and taxes will more than offset that. In addition, we will also see higher eliminations and increased investments in digital initiatives in the second half.", "Bottom line, we feel highly confident in our revised EPS range of $6.45 to $6.60, but we do not expect to deliver over $6.60, the high end of the range.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Carroll, who will take us through the business unit details.", "Carroll K. Lane - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Akhil. I'm on slide four, and I'll be speaking of the segments in constant currency, as we usually do. And as a reminder, there's an appendix on slide 12 with additional segment data as a reference.", "Otis sales were $3.1 billion in the quarter. That was up 1% organically. Excluding China, organic sales were up 4%. Operating profit was down 5% at constant currency. Contribution from higher service volume and productivity was more than offset by continued pricing and mix pressure in China and strategic investments in service and E&D. Foreign exchange translation was a 2 point headwind to sales and earnings.", "New equipment sales were up 1%. Mid-teen growth in North America and high single-digit growth in Europe were largely offset by a 12% decline in China, where the market environment remains very challenging. Service sales were up 5%, including the benefit of acquisitions. Otis saw solid growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up low single digit. New equipment orders were flat in the quarter, with 6% growth in North America offset by a decline of 14% in Europe on tough compares. In China, Otis saw 3% orders growth, with unit orders up 7%.", "Full-year expectations remain unchanged. We continue to expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $175 million at actual currency, with slightly higher than expected pricing and mix pressure but less FX headwind.", "Turning to slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales grew 7% at constant currency in the quarter. Operating profit declined 1% at constant currency, and FX translation was a 1 point headwind to sales and earnings.", "CCS sales grew 5% organically in the quarter, driven by strong North America residential HVAC sales of 11%. Global commercial HVAC was up 3%. And following a strong Q1, commercial refrigeration sales were up 12%. And after more than a year of declines, transport refrigeration saw 3% growth.", "Equipment orders at CCS were strong again in Q2, up 11% organically after 7% growth in Q1. And as Greg said, the orders growth was across all major product lines. Transport refrigeration orders were up 38%. North America residential HVAC was up 16%, and commercial refrigeration was up 9%. Commercial HVAC and fire & security products were up mid-single digits. In short, this was the best growth in CCS organic equipment orders since Q4 of 2014.", "Despite solid top line growth, operating profit declined 2% from the prior year, including the impact of FX. Consistent with Q1, we saw negative impact from mix at several CCS business units. Additionally, CCS added to the charge they took on a large commercial project in Q1. That charge was largely offset by positive one-time benefits, including the sale of a joint venture investment.", "Looking ahead, we expect improvement in the second half, driven by strength in equipment orders, productivity initiatives, and lower FX headwind. We continue to expect CCS operating profit to grow by $100 million to $150 million at actual FX in 2017, but likely closer to the low end of the range. We now expect that CCS will see low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth for the full year.", "Turning to Aerospace on slide 6, Pratt & Whitney sales were up 6% organically in the quarter. This was driven by 30% growth in the military engines business, which benefited from higher F135 deliveries, aftermarket strength, and development revenues. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 4%, with V2500 strength partially offset by lower sales at Pratt & Whitney Canada.", "Commercial OEM sales were down 10%, with increased Geared Turbofan deliveries offset by lower shipments of V2500, GP7000, and Pratt & Whitney Canada engines. The recent supplier quality escape discussed at the Paris Air Show, which was related to engines supporting the A320neo program, unfortunately impacted Airbus Q2 aircraft deliveries. Pratt & Whitney worked aggressively to mitigate the impact of this temporary disruption.", "Pratt delivered 134 GTF engines in the first half of the year, including customer deliveries and spares. We continue to expect a full-year total of 350 to 400 GTF engines, as Greg mentioned earlier.", "Operating profit of $408 million declined 10%. Drop-through from increased military sales, commercial aftermarket, and favorable FX and pension was more than offset by the absence of the prior year's contract settlements and sale of legacy hardware. Continued ramp-related investments and lower Pratt & Whitney Canada shipments were also headwinds in the quarter.", "Based on first half results and anticipated increases in negative engine margin in the second half, we still see Pratt & Whitney full-year operating profit being down $150 million to $200 million, but likely closer to the $200 million end of the range.", "Turning to slide 7, Aerospace Systems sales were down 1% organically. Operating profit of $603 million was up 2%. Commercial OEM sales were down 8%, driven by declines in legacy program volume that more than offset growth on new programs in the quarter. Of note, the end of the Boeing 777 landing gear production at Aerospace Systems impacted commercial OEM sales in the quarter by approximately 3 points. New program ales are expected to ramp more significantly in the back half of the year.", "Commercial aftermarket was up 7%, driven by 17% growth in provisioning. Parts were up 2% while repair was up 7%. Military sales growth resumed in Q2 and was up 5%, with growth in both OEM and aftermarket. Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and military sales, continued cost reductions, and favorable FX impact. These tailwinds were partially offset by unfavorable commercial OEM volume and mix. With solid first half results at Aerospace Systems, we continue to expect operating profit to be up $50 million to $100 million for the full year and likely toward the high end of the range.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay, thank you, Carroll.", "So a solid quarter and a solid start to the year, all of which gives us confidence in our full-year EPS guidance of $6.45 to $6.60. And this year is playing out just as we had expected, again, some puts, some takes, but still a lot to do. And I think that's probably the motto. We need to continue to focus on execution. We need to continue to focus on cost reduction, and we need to be disciplined with our investors' money.", "Having said that, UTC's portfolio is well positioned for growth in the future with the investments that we're making. We remain focused on the aerospace and commercial buildings market globally, and we think we've got the products and services that will allow us to continue to grow for years to come.", "With that, let me stop and open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The first question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, good morning, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So I just wanted to start off with Otis, plus 7% order growth in units and plus 3% overall in China. So just doing the math, that's 4 points maybe from price/mix. Is that the right arithmetic here, Akhil? And if that's the case, that sounds like good news, so maybe just comment on that.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Sure. So this is truly the best quarter we've seen in a while on that price/mix balance, Nigel, to your point. It's actually 5 points, and then we get a negative 5 points from price/mix. We get 1-point benefit from major projects. But still, negative 5 points versus negative 11 points that we saw in the last quarter, so pretty good \u2013 or negative 13 actually in the last quarter, so good progress there. But as you know, the data \u2013 the orders that we booked this quarter will actually show up in sales sometime probably second quarter next year, first and second quarter next year. So I think there's still a long way to go. It's one quarter, but it's encouraging.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Any reason to assume that wouldn't continue into the second half of the year?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "There is still over-capacity in the Chinese market, as you know, and we've just got to just see how it plays out. There is still 700,000 elevator unit capacity as against a demand of maybe 500,000 \u2013 525,000 units. So the pricing pressure will continue. The challenge we are seeing in China though is on the input side a little bit more than we had expected. The material productivity, which used to offset the pricing pressure, has not been forthcoming this year, just because commodity price increases and some of the others, that's keeping a little pressure on the margins in China. But certainly on the top line it's an encouraging sign to see the price/mix equation move in the right direction.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "So let me just add perhaps the more bullish view on China. It is still a growing market. The GDP there will grow more than 6.5%. Property prices remain strong. The long-term outlook is very good. Look, we're suffering this year through really the remnants of what were a tough two years where pricing was very, very difficult. But I think to Akhil's point, it's encouraging what we're seeing here in the quarter. And while we won't see these in actual results play out until early next year, it's still encouraging to see the Chinese market growing. And I think to Akhil's point, we did not get the benefits we thought out of commodities this year. As the dollar has weakened, commodity prices have gone up, not unexpectedly, and that's played out both at Otis and at the CCS business this year. So again, some good, some bad, but long term we remain bullish on China.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. And then a quick follow on just maybe market to market on how the U.S. dollar versus raw materials are looking right now versus plan. And maybe just touch on the contingency you have right now at the midpoint.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Just on the dollar versus commodity, we did not plan for copper to be at about $6,000 a ton today, which is about $3 a pound. That's up significantly for the year, but we've also, as you recall, planned for a euro closer to parity with the dollar.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "$1.05.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "$1.05, closer, versus where it is today. So what we're losing on commodities, steel and on copper, more than making up for that on the currency site. As far as the contingency...", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Nigel, as you know, the FX can move a lot. Last year we were looking at in the second quarter a euro at $1.12 on average, third quarter it was $1.13. And then it went down towards the $1.05 \u2013 $1.03 level. So yes, it feels good today.", "In regard to our forecast, what we assumed is in Q1 we saw a $1.06 euro, second quarter $1.09. We assumed it will be $1.11 for the rest of the year. And if that's what it stays at, we have about roughly a $50 million pickup in earnings from FX. That, as Greg said, we probably lose more than that on the commodity side for both Otis and CCS. So net-net contingencies still vary to us given the raise in our guidance at the bottom end. At the new midpoint, I would say the contingency is about $70 million. At the top end of the range, there is no contingency.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Nigel.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is open.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Jason.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Akhil of Greg, I just wonder if you could walk us through what we expect for the next four quarters on the Aerospace side of the business. We've got lots of moving parts obviously with Geared Turbofan ramp. You've got the line down on some of your work on the 777. Maybe you could just help us from the outside on how you see this playing out from a year-over-year perspective. Can you point to any particular quarter where things begin to align and growth resumes from a top line perspective? And if you do see that, can you talk a little bit about your assumptions around aftermarket growth? You've got lots of I guess what I'd describe as lumpiness given the initial sparing activity that's going on there. But when will we get the momentum going on a clean quarter without a lot of lumpiness and line-downs? Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes. Unfortunately, lumpiness is part of life in Aerospace to some extent. That's just how life plays out. But for UTC Aerospace Systems, Jason, I think we expect commercial OEs to be up in the second half a little bit. But overall for the full year, we expect flattish commercial OE. On the other hand, we do expect the commercial aftermarket business to be up mid-single digit as opposed to the low single digit we were thinking before. So a little more positive on the commercial aftermarket side, largely because of the strength we've seen in provisioning in the first half.", "Compares really get very difficult for provisioning for UTC Aerospace Systems in the fourth quarter, which was a very, very strong quarter last year, as you know. So I think there is some lumpiness which will come. But on the commercial OE side, which was a bit of a surprise in Q2, we do see the new programs pick up in their production rates in the second half. That will more than offset the bad news from the 777 resourcing and the cuts we have seen on the wide body market. So I think net-net, still feel overall good.", "With regard to Pratt. I think the outlook is pretty solid, consistent good growth both on the OE side as well on the aftermarket side. Again, compares get a little bit more challenging, but at least it's good growth every quarter onwards through 2020, I would say.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "And as you look out over the next couple of years and think about potential sun-setting programs, any come to the top of your mind? Maybe talk a little bit about any exposure that you might have on the A380 and just any other sun-setting programs that we all should be thinking about at this point. Thanks, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Jason, I think you probably hit on it with the A380. We didn't ship any engines, GP7000 engines this quarter, or just a couple I guess. But that program is essentially done for us now. That's the GP7000. That's our partnership with GE, and we don't foresee production on that resuming. You've also of course got the V2500 and the A320neo, which will be going out of production probably in 2019. We see that stepping down significantly again next year. Of course, the GTF, we'll build 350 to 400 of those this year. Next year you'll probably build north of 700 of those, so that should pick up the slack that you see on the sun-setting programs on the aerospace, or on the Pratt side.", "As far as Mr. [David] Gitlin's business, Aerospace Systems, I think the biggest pain has already been felt. That's the 777 landing gear, which as you know was re-sourced by Boeing to another company, and that business won't come back. Having said that though, we still are well positioned at both Boeing and Airbus on the aerospace systems and all the other new commercial aircraft, be it Embraer, be it the [Bombardier] C Series or anything emerging. All those things will pick up in production over the next several years. So a few negatives, but on the most part it's pretty positive in terms of where we see top line. Pratt will have 10% organic growth through 2020, and the Aerospace Systems guys probably in that 5% to 7% range, so all generally positive.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hi, good morning, just a question on CC&S. The profit trajectory, even at the low end, I think implies around 9%, 10% profit growth in the second half after down 2% in the second quarter. So maybe just if you could bridge how much really is coming from volume leverage, how much from extra productivity within that step up in year-on-year profits.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Let me start with that, Julian. First of all, if you look at Q2, some anomalies that actually drove margins down. First of all, of course, it's the acquisitions that we've made over the last year and a half or so. That accounted for about half of the margin degradation that we saw.", "But we also had some adverse mix, and most of that again, it's new products that we have been introducing both on the commercial refrigeration and the transport refrigeration side, where we are still coming down the learning curve, much like we are on the GTF. And so some of the products are not going out with normal margins. We're also seeing strength in Transicold in Eastern Europe, where the price is much more competitive than what we typically would see around the world. So there's some mix, there's some cost reduction.", "At the end of the day, though, the back half is going to be driven by top line growth. And I think when you see 11% orders growth in equipment here in the second quarter on top of 7% in the first, we've got a record backlog at CCS which will play out. So this is going to be a top line-driven recovery in the back half of the year. Still confident that when we called $100 million to $150 million of profit growth, probably towards the low end of that just given where commodities are and some of the other macro headwinds, but we still see positive momentum going into the back half of the year.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, Julian, I would just add that the mix story feels very real in terms of the changes. The one example that Greg mentioned, the transport refrigeration business, as you know, both the container and North America truck trailer businesses have been down or weak relative to their past experience, and those are highly profitable businesses. As we look at our backlog and the orders that we saw, both those businesses grew very nicely in terms of the orders and backlog, and that should convert into good earnings in the second half.", "Cost, product cost reductions in the commercial refrigeration space, also the mix shift between service and install business within the fire & security field side, which is what has hurt us in the first two quarters, is expected to change a little as the focus of the management team changes. And then Bob [McDonough] has several productivity initiatives that he has launched in addition to pricing actions that will help improve the back half. But yes, you're right, it still feels like a big hill to climb, but Bob has actions in place to help achieve at least to the low end of the range.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thanks, and then just one quick follow-up on Aerospace. Within Pratt & Whitney, the margins seem to be hanging in there quite well considering everything that's going on. Do you think you're within touching distance now of the floor on margins in that division? And I guess related to that, any change to that $350 million commercial OE mix headwind you had guided for this year?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Julian, I think first question first, I would say that it's natural to suggest that probably next year would be the low point of the margin at Pratt, right, because we have talked about peak negative engine margin coming in 2018. Sales will grow nicely in 2018, but I think the profit is still to be discussed and to be worked out. So I think there will be some margin pressure at Pratt in 2018.", "With regard to the current year, I mentioned this at our last event in Paris Air Show as well. I think for this year, negative engine margin is likely to be higher than the $350 million that we had. Exactly what, we will work through over the next few months and see where it all ends up. Just because of the extra costs we have been incurring associated with the ramp, some early issues that we've been dealing with, which have pushed out some of the cost reduction actions that were in place before, but that is being offset by a stronger commercial aftermarket. So we feel good about the Pratt guidance overall, but there are some puts and takes, as Greg said at the beginning of the call.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "If I remember last year, in the second quarter you had exceptionally strong V2500 aftermarket sales, so this Pratt & Whitney aftermarket is against a very difficult comp. How should we be thinking about Pratt aftermarket sales in Q3-Q4 in terms of the comparisons get a little bit easier?", "Carroll K. Lane - United Technologies Corp.", "Sam, overall the Pratt large engine aftermarket is doing pretty well. We're going to do more V2500 overhauls this year than we did last year. There's probably demand out there for better than 900 shop visits on a worldwide basis, so that's the good news. The content has also been pretty healthy there as well. But the overall trajectory hasn't really changed when you think about the fleet demographics. The 4000 continues to be in attrition mode. We'll see fewer shop visits year over year there. So overall, I think we're happy with how the aftermarket is trending this year. It looks like it's going to be pretty decent rounding out the balance of the year. But overall, no real change to the fundamental trajectory that we set coming into the year.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And can you talk a little bit about Otis Europe service? I know that there was improvement in the first quarter, and I was surprised to see EMEA look flat in the second quarter. I just thought that was starting to see more improvement.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "I think actually, Sam, I would say we're starting to finally see some traction in service in Europe, and there's still a little bit of pricing pressure on the regular maintenance. We still saw some good traction in repair and modernization. So I'd actually say Europe feels a lot better. You look at orders in Europe I think in the quarter were down 14% for new equipment, but that was off of 42% growth last year, so still really good activity on the top line.", "Now, again, part of the problem there is as we deliver all that new equipment, you're going to see margins in Europe contract a little bit because of the mix between new equipment and service. But we're starting to feel broadly better about Europe. I think the economy is picking up there, and we're starting to see some real traction.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Sam, I'd just add to that. As you know well, I think the first sign of improvement comes through the new equipment order book, and we are certainly seeing that. Otis new equipment orders were up 13% in Europe last year, up 28% in the first quarter this year, and down but off a very, very tough compare in the second quarter.", "On the service side, pricing has been improving but not at the pace \u2013 and we certainly didn't expect it to improve too much. So it's still down year over year, but at a much lower rate than we have seen over the last few years. So revenue per unit is improving. We still have investments we are making on the cost side, particularly with the digital tools. We now have about 10,000 of our worldwide technicians with the new digital tools. That adds a little bit to the cost initially as we are taking people off their work routine and putting them through training, but that will start to deliver results over time. So I think that equation still has to play out, but it's an encouraging sign.", "The other aspect I would say is for Europe service, inflation is starting to at least be talked a little bit, even though at very small levels. But for many years, there was no discussion of inflation at all. And now at least there is some talk about potentially a little bit of inflation coming through, which will ultimately show up in our pricing and will relieve some of the price pressure we have seen in Europe, but still a long way to go, I would say.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just back to CCS, if we could, you went through all the moving pieces there. You do have a lot of product launches going on across the portfolio. A), I wonder to what extent you're using price to elbow back into some of these markets. Or B), to what extent do you see a negative price response from your competitors as you work to seat these additional products in the marketplace?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Look, Jeff, you've got to look at this market by market and product by product. I would say broadly, there continues to be price pressure, especially in some of the emerging markets, and we see that in China. Commercial HVAC I think was up 4% in orders in China this quarter. It was on the back of new product introductions. We've actually got some higher efficiency, bigger chillers that we brought to market, but those of course will come at a lower margin just as you come down the learning curve on that. As I say, I think CCS this year will introduce 130 new products.", "If you think about commercial refrigeration, we have typically been in the stationary display cases, and we have been moving to some of the more smaller, more mobile display cases, again to try and grow the top line there, which we're doing. But it's coming at a lower margin. And so I think it's just the natural progression of the business. As you introduce new products, margins are going to be lower. We'll come down the cost curve. Pricing will get better over time, but emerging market pricing is always going to be tough. If you're in Eastern Europe, whether it's Russia or Poland or the Czech Republic, or in China, you're always going to see a lot of pricing pressure there. So I don't think it's anything unusual.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "The one place, Jeff, that seems to be holding up okay is the North America residential HVAC side, where pricing seems to be holding up okay. But most of the markets we are seeing the equation, the dynamics that Greg mentioned.", "If you recall, in the CCS roadmap, EBIT roadmap, we talked about $25 million tailwind from commodity price combination. We now think it's probably a $25 million headwind for the year just because of the pressures in most of the markets and no lift, no benefit from the commodity side. Now more than half of that or half of that will be offset by FX, as Greg alluded to earlier, but definitely that dynamic is not quite as we had expected.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "All right, thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, Ron.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Greg, if I may ask you a bigger strategic question, this year there's been a lot of talk, particularly at Paris. And I think tomorrow Boeing reports their first quarter where they break out a new aftermarket service segment. How do you think about that in light of your commercial aerospace businesses? How much pressure have you seen so far from the various OEs trying to get a bigger piece of the aftermarket? And then how do you think about that going forward? When are you going to make investments in that business in terms of your returns and so on and so forth?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Ron, that is one of the fundamental strategic issues I think that the aerospace industry has going forward. It's who gets to participate in the aftermarket. And the model has always been that the OEs take big risks and invest big dollars along with the first-tier suppliers to develop all these innovative products and solutions. If we're going to change that model where the OEs are going to take more of the aftermarket or demand more of the aftermarket, we're going to have to think about how we price our products to the OEs.", "If you think about it, we spent $10 billion on the GTF platform just getting it to market, and we're spending over or we'll spend $1 billion a year on negative engine margin. If all of a sudden I lose that aftermarket, I don't have a business going forward. And so I think we need to have these discussions, as we have started to do with the big OEs about partnership, risk/revenue sharing arrangements. But clearly, you can't continue on with the current business model if the OEs are going to demand a bigger and a much more significant chunk of the aftermarket.", "The good news is we've got great technology. And I think as long as we continue to innovate and stay ahead of the curve on the technology, we'll have an ability to have those discussions on a level playing field with the OEs, and I think that's very important as we go forward. But there's a lot of pressure out there. We've had various scope initiatives out of Airbus. We've had PFS 1 and now PFS 2 coming from the Boeing Company. Again, it's tough. We're always looking for cost reduction. It's a very competitive marketplace, and we just have to continue to invest and stay ahead from an innovation standpoint if we're going to continue with the business model that we've got. But it's a tough question.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Now just, if I may, follow up on that.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Sure.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Be it that you have a whole portfolio of businesses, if it really got tough enough, would you just start allocating capital someplace else?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "I think, again, the more difficult it gets from a pricing and aftermarket standpoint, I think what you'll do is you'll try and focus on those systems on the aircraft where you've got the best technology and the biggest competitive advantage. And so we have some product lines that are not as robust from a market standpoint as others. You may see us decide to allocate capital differently in that respect, as that we just don't invest in those things where we don't have a clear market leader or a clear technology lead. But again, those are all good questions I think at the individual portfolio. It's the same thing I would say across the business. If there are places where we're not making money as much as we'd like, we're not going to allocate capital there unless we know that we're going to get a return on it. So it's not lost to us, Ron. I think it's one of the things we think about all the time and talk about all the time internally here.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "What do you guys see from Otis second half? Is this a sustainable trend now in China for those guys from an OE perspective?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "It's difficult to say, Steve. As you know, the market kind of moves. So while the expectation is for this year we'll have flat, maybe 5% down in the new equipment order market, first half has been a little better than that, we believe, for the market, certainly better than that for us. So we hope that that trend continues. But also of all the markets that we play in, China is probably the one where it's most difficult to call in terms of exactly how it will play out. The government there has abilities to move the markets much more than other markets. And so my crystal ball is not that clear on Otis China.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And when it comes to the Pratt engine loss next year, so I think you said sales up, margins down a little bit. Is there any change to the year-over-year dynamics around \u2013 I think the engine loss is a little bigger this year, but any change to the year-over-year for 2018? And do you think you have any incremental risk ring fence at this stage of the game, or is it still too early to call?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "You're keep trying, Steve, and we keep saying we're not going to tell you, but let me just put it this way. We still believe 2018 is going to be the peak for negative engine margin at Pratt. Whether it's going to peak at exactly what we thought six months ago, I'm not sure. I'm looking at the learning curves on a monthly basis, and we're still coming down on 87% learning curve on the engine.", "Now we're a little bit behind in production. We'll catch up in the back half of the year. And still there are things that we need to do, engineering changes to drive some cost out of the engine. Some of those things are taking a little bit longer than what we expected. Certainly, some of the support costs for the supply chain has been a little bit more expensive than what we thought, so all that will play into product cost next year, maybe not from a material standpoint but certainly from an overhead standpoint. So Pratt's working through all that, and we'll have a much better view here in a couple of months.", "I would tell you, as we look out at the long term, by 2020, 2021 we are right on top of where we said we were going to be when we started the program. So Pratt's got \u2013 there's a lot of work to do. The suppliers move high cost to low cost. There's redesigns that have to happen to drive some cost out, but we're seeing the productivity both in our factories and in our suppliers that give us confidence we're going to hit that 2020 goal. So again, we'll see where we are.", "I would tell you, there's pressure on the negative engine margin next year. It's full stop. Now whether that's $10 million or more, I don't know. Akhil's like saying don't say anything, so I won't tell you, but we're working through it.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And maybe you won't answer this one either. Akhil, you gave great detail on the first half and second half, so much detail that I am not a math guy, so I have a lot of trouble putting all the numbers in my spreadsheet. Maybe you can help us out with the third quarter just number, the Street is at $1.72. You gave a ton of detail around the second half. Is that around the right number so that we can all be calibrated for second half?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Steve, saying you're not a math guy, really it's a little disingenuous, but okay. I've never known a better numbers guy than you. So I don't know, Akhil, you want to talk about third quarter?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "We typically don't talk specifically about a quarter. Steve, you know that the negative engine margin is going to be greater in the third quarter. We've had a good strong finish to the second quarter. None of that I expect is going to flow through for the full year. So it obviously has to balance out of Q3 and Q4. You guys make a pick. You're smart people, smarter than I am. You can make a pick on how much comes out of Q3 and how much comes out of Q4.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, now who's being disingenuous? Thanks a lot, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thank you, Steve.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks, good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, Doug.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I wanted to talk about the Geared Turbofan because Airbus only delivered six GTF-powered A320neos in Q2. They've got a lot of airplanes on the ground in Toulouse without engines on them. How do you see the 350 to 400 engines you plan to deliver? How do you operationally see that playing out this year?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, Doug, as we pointed out back in June at the Air Show that we did have a sub-tier quality escape that caused us to retest a number of engines late in the second quarter. And that obviously caused some issues on the production line and in Toulouse, which caused the small number of aircraft to be delivered.", "As I think about it, we built in the first half of the year about 145 GTF engines. We delivered a little bit less than 140. The back half of the year, if we do 205, that takes us to the 350. Clearly, we see line of sight to 350-plus. Whether we get all the way to 400, I don't know. But we've got a commitment to Airbus in terms of the number of engines that we have to get on dock. We did that through the end of the second quarter, albeit with a lot of pushing and shoving at the very end because of this retesting that we had to do with some of the engines. So hopefully, we'll get some of these kinks worked out here in the third and fourth quarter and make it a little bit more seamless for Airbus because it's causing them pain on the line out there.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "But what happens given that in October you should be delivering the new combustor? So the engines that you're building before then will be, I assume, with the previous design, which has the issues that we well know about. How do you see that going forward since you're going to have this mix delivered out to the customer community? And does this mean you're going to be ultimately doing a lot more retrofits later on?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, so what will happen, Doug, is because the life on the current combustor is not what we had expected, we'll have to manage that configuration. And our plans for the next couple of years will be to bring those engines in at probably an earlier overhaul interval than what we had expected. We factored all of that in, of course, in all of the contracts that we have already, because we know the timing of how long they'll last on wing. And hopefully by the time we get to this next generation of combustor, we call it the CSTAR (48:12) combustor, we'll have adequate life on it so that we won't have to worry about it. But it's just one of those configuration things that we'll have to manage with the airline operators.", "The good news about the combustor is we can actually schedule an overhaul. It doesn't result in canceled flights. It doesn't result in a lot of disruption to the operator. And so again, you can manage that through spares and planned overhauls because you can measure the deterioration of the combustor liner over time. So while it will be a little bit more expensive, we've factored it in. We're working with the airlines. They understand the product that they're getting is not of the quality that we had originally expected, but we've got a plan to get that fixed and we'll manage it with them.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "So presumably this is all in the margin outlook guidance you're giving us this year, next year.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes, keep in mind, these are 20-year aftermarket contracts. So while the first overhaul might happen a little earlier, we'll incorporate other things that should keep this engine on wing longer, which will ultimately benefit the margins over the long term on the program.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, I just want to make it clear that yes, it's all factored into 2017 the way we've made out our guidance, but we have not yet given guidance for 2018. So we've got \u2013 I know you guys are anxious to get to that, but there's a timeline we follow. We want to go through our planning process and make sure we understand fully and give you a number that we can live by.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you very much. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question will come from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, good morning. First one is just a clarification. How big was that second charge at CCS on the applied?", "And then in terms of going back to I think Ron's question on the aftermarket, just when you think about your business and the mode around your business, in spare parts you clearly get massive notes. But in your UTAS and particularly the MRO business you have, how big is MRO versus what you'd consider more of your spare parts closed off aftermarket in UTAS, where price is a determining or at least partial determining factor in retaining that business?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So first question, I think on the charge, it's about $0.03 in the second quarter. But as Greg said or as Carroll said in the script, it was almost entirely offset by positive one-timers. So I wouldn't say that the charge, while it was painful, was a reason for whatever performance you saw out of CCS in the current quarter on a one-timer basis.", "With regard to your second question, I think we have talked about the fact that UTAS commercial aftermarket is about $4.4 billion in totality. And the repair part, the MRO part of the business, is probably $1.5 billion to $2 billion of the $4.5 billion roughly give or take, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion or something in that range.", "The remaining on the spare parts and provisioning side, I would say one thing, Myles. It's not that easy. When we have the aftermarket, we have IP and we have the technology content on those spare parts. The onus is on us to make sure that we stay ahead from a technology point of view. There are no surplus or substitute parts available to displace it that easily because that's where the value is. That's what we invested in, and we have to get the returns on those. So I don't expect that to become a source of great contention in terms of pricing or whatever. We just have to make sure that we stay disciplined and keep that aftermarket to ourselves.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And then on E&D, I think it's up $60 million in the first half. But, Akhil, I think you mentioned it as a headwind in the second half. What is it supposed to be up for the full year?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Are you talking about E&D for?", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Overall the company, at the company level.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "I think some of it is, again, not that inconsistent. We do expect E&D to come down in the back half for UTAS and level off at Pratt as well. So I think overall, we're probably thinking $50 million to $75 million overall for the year. So whatever you've seen in the first half is probably just going to stay at that level, maybe a little bit higher at Otis and CCS, but not that much more on the aerospace side.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, and the next question is from Peter Arment of Baird. Your line is open.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thanks, good morning, Greg and Akhil. Greg, quickly on Pratt & Whitney Canada, shipments down 15% year to date. How should we think about that for I guess just overall for the year? And maybe, if you could, just give a little color on what you're seeing in general regarding the individual components? I assume the weakness is just all biz jets and civil helicopters, but just a little more on that.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "You got it exactly right, Peter. The fact is civil helicopter has been very weak. Part of that has to do, of course, with the oil and gas glut, if you will, which has caused demand for civil helicopter to shrink dramatically.", "The other issue of course, business jets, we still while we believe long term in biz jets and the marketplace, we still have not really seen a return and we're still significantly below peak levels of production on business jets, and those are really the two big drivers. The rest of it, as you know, the regional turboprops and all that, all pretty good. But really it's just those two markets that have been much softer than what we had expected going into the year.", "Carroll K. Lane - United Technologies Corp.", "Peter, we'll see year-over-year declines on those volumes in 2017 throughout the back half and maybe some sequential improvement. But as Greg just said, the long-term trend, it feels like it's yet to fully bottom. So about what we expected coming into the year, maybe some modest improvement sequentially on volumes, but no major change.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay, I appreciate that. I'll stick to one. Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thank you, Peter.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you, good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning.", "Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Switching back to Otis, do you expect 2017 to be the trough year for Otis margins? And maybe you could walk through just upside/downside drivers heading into next year for Otis margins.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Matt, we have a lot of time to talk about 2018 in great detail at a future time. I think the key thing to keep in mind is, look, our focus at Otis is about starting to grow earnings. It's not the story right now at least. We need to find a way to start growing earnings, operating margin dollars, not necessarily operating margin percent.", "What I can tell you with high confidence is that we do believe we will keep, maintain, and have industry-leading margins at Otis. And they will be significantly higher than the next competitor just because of the skill we have both on the OE side and the density benefit we get on the service side. We have nearly 2 million service units under maintenance as opposed to 1.4 million for the next leading player. So that 600,000 extra units gives density, which should allow for greater productivity for our technicians and should allow us to command a premium and therefore an operating margin percent advantage over the second and third players in the industry. But what that number is going to be, clearly at 900 basis points it was too high. But could it be 300, 400, 500 basis points higher? Absolutely. When we get there, I think the first step is to start growing earnings at Otis, and that itself right now is we're going through some challenging phase of investment and still dealing with the pressure that we are seeing in China, the biggest market. It will take a little time, but I'm not going to necessarily talk about 2018 today.", "Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. On the strategic investments specifically, could you remind us how that spending trends into next year?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So think about it this way. We've got about 16,000 of the 31,000 technicians will be equipped with the tools this year. The rest will follow next year. And additionally. we will also continue to see some increase in R&D investment a little bit next year as we try to get up to the 1.8% of sales level will that Greg and Philippe [Delpech] have talked about. We are at about 1.6% right now, so slight growth in R&D but not much. And then we should start to see some returns on the investments we are making this year. So net-net exactly how that plays out is the subject of our planning process, and we want to get through that before we really give you with any confidence on 2018.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Matt, I think the one question mark on Otis which is overhanging all these discussions is China. And as we have seen this quarter, we're getting a little bit of positive news in terms of what's happening with price/mix, but it's still down, and part of that will play into next year. And if the trends that we saw in second quarter continue in the third and fourth quarter, I think we'll feel a lot better about Otis next year. But again, I think that's the big question mark.", "Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the last question will come from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.", "Thank you very much. In the past, Greg, you've been able to identify restructuring opportunities that continue to position the business for positive momentum. You have only modest restructuring so far this year, and yet you talk a lot about pricing pressure and some other competitive challenges. Could you elaborate a little bit along your thinking at the moment as to where you are in terms of pushing the organization to find other opportunities to dig deep to find creative solutions?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Howard, that is a great question. And as we think about 2018, it's one of the things that we are focused on is structural cost reduction. One of the things that we're trying to do is look at organizational structure, trying to flatten things out. We've got great people throughout the organization. We want to free up the decision-makers that are closest to the business and remove some of the bureaucracy. So we're looking to do some structural things in the back half of the year with the organization to free people up to make those decisions more readily.", "So we're looking at doing some things here, really it's organization.", "At the same time, the need to continue to reduce factory footprint remains, I think Dave Gitlin has some things on his plate. I know Bob McDonough does as well, so we're going to continue to go by the playbook of taking out high-cost locations or low-cost locations where the markets are moving. But at the same time, we're going to look internally and see what we can do to the organizational structure to flatten it out and give ourselves some additional runway for the next couple of years.", "Howard A.

Baird & Co., Inc.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the United Technologies Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC's website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items.", "The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K Reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "In addition, in connection with the Rockwell Collins acquisition, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement that includes a preliminary prospectus of UTC and a preliminary proxy statement of Rockwell Collins which is not yet effective which contain important information about UTC, Rockwell Collins, this transaction and related matters.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself in the queue as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay, thank you, Latoya, and good morning everyone. You saw from our press release this morning Q3 was another strong quarter for UTC. We saw adjusted EPS of $1.73 and adjusted sales of $15.4 billion. That included organic sales growth of 6%. Our performance through three quarters and a clear line of sight to Q4 gives us confidence to raise our 2017 EPS expectations to a range of $6.58 to $6.63, and that's up of course from $6.45 to $6.60.", "Clearly, the investments we've been making in the business are translating now into sustained sales growth. The third quarter was UTC's best quarter for organic growth since 2011. And our year-to-date organic sales growth stands at 4%.", "Pratt & Whitney's organic growth in the quarter was 15%. Pratt shipped 120 Geared Turbofan engines which includes some of those that were allocated to our spares pool, but that 120 shipments nearly matches the output for the entire first half. So with 254 engines shipped year-to-date, Pratt remains well on track to the 350 to 400 engine target that we laid out earlier this year.", "Maybe just a quick update on the on the GTF durability issues. Pratt remains on track to certify a combustor upgrade to incorporate into new engines here in the fourth quarter. With regard to the number three seal issue, you'll recall that production engines began receiving upgraded hardware back in the second quarter of this year and then ongoing retrofits were completed out in the field.", "While we're still seeing some success with the actions we've taken to date, we're also looking at design alternatives that are expected to further improve durability in the engine. We'll continue to work closely with our customers to support their operations as future retrofits are completed.", "At CCS, we have introduced more than 200 new products over the last two years. And these investments in innovation are paying off with sales growth. In the quarter, we saw 4% organic sales growth with all the major businesses in CCS contributing. Year-to-date, CCS new equipment orders are up 7%.", "At Otis, as you know, we've increased our R&D investment over the last several years to accelerate the development of some innovative new products for our customers and to address some underserved segments. In 2017, Otis will launch twice as many product variances in 2015 and these innovations are helping to drive organic growth.", "In the quarter, Otis saw 2% organic growth. This is Otis' third quarter straight with organic sales growth in spite of the continuing pressure we see in China, which of course is the largest new equipment market for Otis.", "As you saw of course in the \u2013 we announced the appointment of Judy Marks as the new President of Otis recently. I'm confident that as you interact with her over the coming months, you'll be impressed with the leadership skills and the strong focus on the customer as she drives both strategic growth, innovation and earnings growth at Otis in the coming years. We're excited to have Judy on the team.", "So a good quarter for UTC, and we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and we're confident in the improved outlook for 2017.", "With that, let me turn it over to Akhil and Carroll to take you guys through the results. Thanks. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Thank you, Greg. So I'm on slide 2. The reported sales were $15.1 billion, up 5%. That included 6 points organic growth and 1 point of favorable foreign exchange. This was partially offset by 2 points from a non-recurring charge at Pratt & Whitney related to customer contract matters. This charge was driven by our decision to allocate more of the GTF engines produced towards spares to support the airline operators in the field who are dealing with the two durability issues that Greg mentioned and we have discussed throughout this year.", "Adjusted EPS of $1.73 was down 2% from the prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.67, down 4% and included $0.06 of restructuring. Non-recurring items included $196 million charge at Pratt. This was entirely offset by gains on sales of securities and a tax adjustment.", "Operating cash net of CapEx was an outflow of $472 million, driven by the $1.9 billion discretionary contribution we made to our domestic pension fund which we had announced last month. So, no surprises here. The quarterly cash when you adjust for this pension contribution was 88% of net income, in line with our expectations, and we remain confident in our full year free cash flow guidance of $3 billion to $3.5 billion.", "Turning to slide 3. You will see the drivers of our strong organic growth. The macroeconomic environment continues to improve and we feel particularly good about the end markets we serve. Commercial construction in Americas and Europe remains strong and global aviation traffic continues to grow at rates above long-term trends.", "So looking at our commercial businesses. In the Americas, sales were up 6% with solid growth in Otis new equipment and service businesses. CCS was up 6% with strong growth across all product lines. Within EMEA, sales were up 3% with low double digit growth in the Otis new equipment business and 2% growth at CCS. Also for the first time in over two years, we saw orders grow in the Middle East for both Otis and CCS in the same quarter. In Asia, sales were up 2%. Otis channel overall was down 7%, a slight improvement from Q2. The rest of Asia was up mid single digit for Otis and was flat at CCS.", "On the Aerospace side, commercial aerospace sales were up 7% in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% at both Pratt and Aerospace Systems. OEM sales at Pratt were also strong, with higher GTF volumes and higher spare engine sales on legacy programs. Consistent with the first half, commercial OEM sales at Aerospace Systems were down. Military sales were up 14% at Pratt & Whitney and down slightly at Aerospace Systems.", "Now before I hand it over to Carroll, a note on 2018. We are still in the planning process for the next year, but at this point, no change to the framework we provided last month. For the existing portfolio, we continue to expect EPS growth in 2018 with each of our four business units being flat to up in earnings next year. The areas we continue to watch carefully before finalizing the plan are of course FX and commodities, where we've seen some inflation coming through.", "Bottom line, we feel good about our increased EPS outlook of $6.58 to $6.63 for the year and our ability to grow EPS in 2018. Organic growth is happening now, and will continue, helping us to grow earnings and cash flow over the years to come.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Carroll for business unit details.", "Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on slide 4. I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there's an appendix on slide 12 with additional segment data you can use as a reference.", "Otis sales were $3.2 billion in the quarter, and that was up 2% organically. Operating profit was down 7% at constant currency. Contribution from higher volume and productivity was more than offset by continued pricing and mix pressure, predominantly in China as well as strategic investments in service and E&D. Foreign exchange translation was a 1 point tailwind to sales and earnings.", "New equipment sales were up 2%. Low-double digit growth in Europe and high-single digit growth in North America were largely offset by a 10% decline in China, where the market and environment remains challenging. Service sales were up 5%, including the benefit of acquisitions. Otis saw solid growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up low-single digits.", "New equipment orders were down 4% in the quarter. 25% growth in Europe was more than offset by a decline of 24% in North America, which had a tough compare, as well as declines in Asia excluding China. In China, orders were flat in dollar terms, with unit orders up 8%. Full-year expectations for Otis remain unchanged. We continue to expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $175 million at actual FX.", "Climate, Controls & Security grew sales 6% in the quarter. Operating profit grew 5%. FX translation was a 2 point tailwind to sales and a 1 point tailwind to earnings. CCS grew 4% organically in Q3, with growth in every major product segment. Commercial refrigeration was up 11% and transport refrigeration grew 8%. Residential HVAC was up mid-single digits, despite lower cooling degree days in the quarter. Global commercial HVAC was up 4%, with strength in the Americas and Europe more than offsetting weakness in Asia and the Middle East.", "Total equipment orders at CCS were up 2% in the quarter, primarily driven by 7% growth in global commercial HVAC. This is the first quarter of orders growth in the Middle East since Q3 of 2015. Commercial refrigeration orders grew high-single digits, offsetting a 10% decline in transport refrigeration. Residential HVAC orders were down 3% after seeing double-digit growth in the first half of the year. Global fire and security orders were up 2%.", "Organic volume contribution in the quarter was mostly offset by price and mix headwind. Productivity gains from restructuring and product cost reduction delivered 4% profit growth at constant currency. For the full year, we remain confident that CCS will deliver low to mid-single digit organic sales growth and that operating profit growth will be at the low end of the $100 million to $150 million range at actual FX.", "Turning to Aerospace on slide 6. Pratt & Whitney sales were strong, up 15% organically in the quarter. Total commercial OEM sales were up 31% and that was primarily due to higher Geared Turbofan deliveries and favorable mix on legacy programs.", "Pratt & Whitney Canada OEM shipments were down. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% on continuing V2500 strength. Sales at the military engines business were up 14%, benefiting from higher F135 and tanker deliveries, aftermarket strength and development revenues.", "Pratt & Whitney operating profit of $423 million was up 2%. Drop-through from the commercial aftermarket and higher military sales, as well as favorable FX and pension, was mostly offset by higher negative engine margin and ramp-related costs as well as the impact of lower Pratt & Whitney Canada shipments and a customer insolvency reserve.", "As Akhil mentioned, Pratt has increased the allocation of GTF production to the spare engine pool, which reduces total negative engine margin. This, along with the higher commercial aftermarket volume, leads us to expect full-year operating profit to be down $125 million to $175 million, but likely closer to the $125 million end of the range. And that's an improvement over prior expectations.", "So, before I move onto Aerospace Systems, just a note; the shift toward spare engines will also negatively impact corporate eliminations as UTAS inter-company profit on GTF completions is eliminated at the corporate level.", "Turning to slide 7. Aerospace Systems delivered 4% profit growth on flat organic sales. Commercial OEM sales were down 6%, driven by declines in legacy program volume that more than offset growth on new programs in the quarter. Of note, the end of the Boeing 777 landing gear production at Aerospace Systems impacted commercial OEM sales in the quarter by approximately 4 points. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% and was driven by nearly 30% growth in provisioning. Parts were up 2% while repair was up 8%.", "Military sales were down slightly in the quarter. Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost reduction and pension tailwind. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable OEM volume and mix. A favorable customer settlement in the quarter offset the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a non-core asset.", "With solid year-to-date results at Aerospace Systems, we continue to expect operating profit to be up $50 million to $100 million for the full year and likely toward the high end of the range on low single digit organic sales growth.", "And with that, I will hand it back to Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Okay thanks, Carroll. So again, good performance so far this year, and we feel good about our revised outlook for 2017. But more importantly, we remain confident in the business units' 2020 targets.", "We're also of course very excited about the Rockwell Collins deal and what it will bring to our Aerospace portfolio. Collins is the ideal complement to our Aerospace Systems business. We've been very impressed with the team at Collins and we look forward to bringing together two world class organizations. We're also confident the combination of Aerospace Systems and Collins will create significant value for our customers as we develop aircraft systems that are more electric, more intelligent, more integrated and more connected.", "We're also confident that the deal will be accretive to earnings at UTC in 2019, assuming we close by the middle of next year. This will create value for the shareowners in both the near term and for decades to come. As always, we remain focused on delivering our commitments to our customers and our strategic priorities which include focused execution and innovation for growth.", "And with that, let me open it up, the call for questions. Latoya?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The first question is from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC", "Hey, good morning gentlemen.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC", "I wondered if you could help me understand the Pratt performance a little bit better. Maybe bridge that 30% growth on, clearly you got 14% growth in large commercial engine deliveries. Presumably that's related to the spares deliveries year-over-year. Maybe help us bridge that. And with respect to the charge on the spare engine deliveries, how many engines did that relate to?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "I'm not going to tell you the exact number of engines, Carter. You're very good at math and that's something which is contractual, so I don't think we should try and talk about that. But it's safe to say that that charge takes care of an uncertain cloud that was hanging over our head to some extent and some of you had been commenting about some larger numbers that might be out there. So I think this takes care of that. It puts an uncertainty behind us.", "With regard to the sales, I think you hit it exactly right for Pratt. The 31% growth in commercial, large commercial engine business, OE side, was driven to a large extent by the mix of spare engines on the legacy side which had higher dollar per unit composition as always. And so that's what drove a 13% increase while the shipment increase was only 14%.", "Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC", "So is there a way to characterize how many fewer spares you delivered year-over-year in percentage terms?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Carter, let's think about it like this. So we had a commitment to Airbus and we had a commitment to Bombardier to deliver a certain number of engines this year to support their aircraft production plans. We made the decision early October or late September, I guess it was, that we were going to redirect a number of spares to our airline customers to make sure that they had enough assets to be able to fly their plane every day. And while the GTF has a dispatch reliability of like 99.8%, because of these two durability issues that we've been talking about, there were a number of aircraft that were on the ground for unacceptably long time periods. And so working with Airbus, working with Bombardier, we agreed to take production engines and divert it into the spares fleet.", "Now there was a charge associated, and that's what Akhil was talking about. It's both Airbus and it's Bombardier. But the fact is we had to do what was right for the customer here. And it gets us behind us. I think the important thing is to look at the number of actual engines that we built in the quarter, which is 120, and we're well on our way to hit that 350 to 400 next year and probably almost doubling that again next year.", "So I think Bob and the team have done yeoman's work over at Pratt to get the production issues behind us, to get the durability issues behind us, and the airlines love the engine. And so look, it was unfortunate that we couldn't meet our commitments to Airbus and Boeing, or Airbus and Bombardier, but they understood the need to keep the airline customers up flying and we've done I think the right thing for the business in the long term.", "Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC", "Great. Thanks for the color, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will come from of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hey. Greg, enjoyed reading the S4.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Me too.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And it's so many questions to ask, but I'll just make it one. It sounds like the overture started with the idea of some type of partnership arrangement. And I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit kind of what that might have looked like and what it would have actually implied for the UTC portfolio. It sounds like it was a quasi breakup of the portfolio is where I'm going.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "I wouldn't go quite that far, Jeff. But I think when I first started these conversations with Kelly earlier this year, it was really around a way to try to unlock the value of a combination of Rockwell and our Aerospace Systems business in the most, I'll say, shareowner-friendly basis that we could come up with.", "And so the original proposal that I went to Kelly with and our folks had come up with a structure where we would contribute our Aerospace Systems business, they would contribute their business into a joint venture. We would own about two thirds of it. Rockwell Collins shareowners would own about a third of it, and there's a very tax efficient way to do this and you get all the benefits of the synergies.", "After a lot of discussion with Kelly, I know Kelly and his board spent some time going through this, they really had some concerns about how the governance might work with Rockwell Collins only owning a third of the joint venture. And so they came back to us as it says in the S-4 and they suggested that we make an offer for the whole company, which we ultimately did.", "This wasn't an idea to break up the portfolio though. I think this was how do you maximize the value of the Aerospace Systems business, how do you get the synergies that you have with Rockwell in a manner that is as shareowner-friendly as you can do, so there's no tax leakage. There was no big fees to pay to anything. It was just a pretty simple transaction. But again, we were still going to control two thirds of the combined partnership and still have all the benefits that would have accrued back to UTC shareowners as a result.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Would this thing have traded, Greg, like the Baker Hughes/GE thing? Or would it just have been a private partnership between the two?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "No, it would have been a \u2013 well, so it would have been a private partnership, one third owned by, and again, the percentages are maybe a little off, may have been 35% or 38% or even 40% Rockwell Collins and then 66% to 60% UTC. But we would have owned it. The Rockwell Collins shares would have continued to trade publicly which would have been the proxy for at least a third of the value was of the joint venture.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you. Interesting stuff.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, yeah, good morning guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Ron.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "A couple questions for you. Specifically on Pratt, the $196 million charge I guess you took, you also took about $100 million last year. So why is that justifiably you take it out of the results? I mean isn't that just sort of an operating expense? I mean, I don't know. I mean, seems unfair to me to take it out.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, I'm not sure how fairness comes into the equation. The thought was we want to be able to show what the Pratt business is doing on a run rate basis. The fact is the non-recurring gain that we talked about, Akhil, the sale of some assets was also an investment that Pratt had made years ago. So the thought was pull everything out of the segment and keep it at the UTC level so as you can see what the underlying performance is of the business. However you guys want to model it have at it. We're going to be transparent about this thing. That's why we laid it out there, but we're not trying to hide anything. We're simply just trying to say, here's what the run rate business looks like at Pratt & Whitney.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes, and just for that reason, Ron, just to be clear, consistently what we do is we take larger charges out of any segment. It happened to be Pratt this time. But if it is something at CCS or something else which is non-operational in nature and doesn't happen frequently, I mean this one unfortunately has happened twice now in two years, but we hope this is the end of it and we won't see it again. So we wanted to give a sense of proper operational performance at Pratt. And as Greg said, gains also related to Pratt to some extent and those were pulled out of the segment as well.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, Great. And then maybe just changing gears real quick. Looks like Bombardier might have hit a lottery ticket here with Airbus taking over the C Series. A, question one, if you can say in aggregate, what is your content on the C Series, right? Because if you think about it from the engines and all the Goodrich stuff, the air monitoring equipment and the cells and then all the stuff Collins has on an airplane, you guys are all over that airplane. So just curious, if you can say what is your content in aggregate, because I know you probably can't break it out piece by piece.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then the second question is, if Airbus does sell 2,000 of these things, which they're talking about, what do you guys have to do to deliver on that? Because all of a sudden, this program might end up being a heck of a lot larger than anybody ever thought it would be.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. I'd say that would be really good news. Look, the combined UTAS, Pratt and Rockwell Collins content on the C Series is a little over, I think it's 34%, 35%. So we have a big chunk of the bill-of-material and therefore a big investment in this aircraft and a lot at stake in seeing that it's successful. I think talking to both Alain and to Tom Enders last week, I said it's a great deal for them. And I think long term it would be a good deal for UTC as well given the content that we have on the aircraft.", "Look, in my mind, it was a validation of the Geared Turbofan because the GTF, as you guys know, is the sole-source engine on the C Series. And despite all that's been written about the durability issues, blah, blah, blah, the fact is the engine works and Airbus has high confidence in it or they wouldn't have done this deal. And so to me it was really just validation of GTF works.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay, Ron.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you. So maybe switching to the commercial side of the house. In Otis, the adjusted profits were down more year-on-year in Q3 than they were in Q2 and your OE orders turned negative for the first time in a year. So maybe give a little bit of context around how quickly you think that slide can be reversed, particularly as the China pricing doesn't seem to be getting any better. So, I just wondered when you're looking ahead what you think can get that profit or that adjusted profit ex-currency back to a flattish trajectory?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes, Julian, great question. So first of all, on the price/mix side in China, this is now the second quarter where we have actually seen some improvement from the trends that we were seeing prior to that. Remember the disconnects used to be a lot higher between units and the order dollar value.", "This quarter, while the number is a 8 point disconnect, units grew 8% while dollar orders were flat. Half of that was just due to the function of absence of major projects. As you know, major projects will have higher dollars per unit. And fewer major projects orders booked in the third quarter this year resulted in about half of the disconnect. So, the price/mix was about 4 points, which is similar to what we saw in the second quarter, which was a lot less, less than half of what we saw in the first quarter. So I think there is some improvement happening there.", "There is also this pressure on the commodity side, what the Otis China team is feeling and the rest of the players are feeling as well, which is pushing a little bit better pricing discipline in China, and we are hopeful that we will see some of that result into better price/mix going forward. There's still a long way to go in China. I'm not saying that we are out of the woods there or the industry is. But certainly, there's gain in share that we're seeing in China and the detailed market segmentation our team has done is proving good in terms of at least the unit order volume growth.", "As regards to the overall earnings for Otis, the team is still working hard to make sure that we can be flattish to up in 2018. We're not done with the plans for next year. But clearly, some sign of stabilization in Europe. New equipment orders were up significantly. Our portfolio growth in service was up in a more normal manner in the current quarter. And I think the rate of decline in the service pricing in Europe has been lower in third quarter than it has been for the last several quarters, years. So, we've seen some sign of improvement, but still ways to go.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC", "It's Lucy on for Cai. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, Lucy.", "Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC", "A follow-up on the GTF. Can you help us quantify how much the spare engines have helped in alleviating the negative engine margins, and how do you think the mix of spares versus customer deliveries will look going forward?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So the first thing, Lucy, is that the big change you see is in terms of improvement in the aircraft on ground numbers. So, the big benefit that you've seen is by converting some of these engines to spare pool, we've alleviated the pressure and the pain that the airline operators were facing. That's step number one.", "In terms of the improvement in Pratt profit outlook, as you recall, we went from being down $200 million to down $125 million for this year. That $75 million essentially is all a function of lower negative engine margin due to this shift in allocation. So I think that's probably what it is.", "In my view, Lucy, this is essentially front-running some of the investment we would have had to make in spare pools in any case. Over the years, there is a certain ratio of spare pools to the number of engines that you have out in the field. All we are doing is doing that investment earlier than what would have happened over the next couple of years. I think we probably have one more year of similar level of investment in spare pools, but then that level of overall spares will help manage the growing fleet at GTF in 2019 and 2020. So, a little front-running of investment, but overall not a bad thing.", "Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Very helpful. I'll pass it on.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Akhil, just to follow up on that, if you did pull some of those expenses forward, or the shift in spares, you had talked about $1.1 billion worth of new engine margin losses next year. How does this change in accounting treatment affect that loss as we look into next year?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, it doesn't change the absolute number for the negative engine margin next year, Sam. So that's still $1.1 billion or so. What it does do is it creates a little bit more headwind for Pratt on a year-over-year basis, because negative engine margin this year has come down, next year stays the same. So, it puts a little bit more pressure on Pratt in terms of staying flat for next year in earnings. But they are working on it.", "Commercial aftermarket has been a little bit better. We do expect the GTF, the V2500-related shop visits to continue to grow next year. So, we are all in the middle of working through all those dynamics. Pratt Canada should be better. Joint Strike Fighter production is better next year. E&D should be flattish to maybe down. So, I think all those things are in the mix. While there is incremental negative engine margin year-over-year, the absolute number does not change from the $1.1 billion.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And then on the pension contribution. Can you talk about what that does to both the book and the cash taxes for this year and next? How should we think about that?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So, for this, the tax benefit is essentially all this year. There is no benefit to the book tax rate. But, certainly, from a cash point of view, we do see a reduction in our cash taxes as a result of the $1.9 billion contribution. And if you go back and look at the chart I had at the last webcast, which was middle of September, there was a reconciliation which took into account $1.9 billion going down to roughly $1.2 billion impact on cash flow for this year adjusted for the tax benefit that we got. So we took that into account when we gave the new guidance of the $3 billion to $3.5 billion. The cash benefit on taxes was offset against the $1.9 billion.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good. Thank you.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey guys. Just obviously CCS trends pretty robust across the board in terms of sales trends. Thinking about just the high single digit growth in non-resi and commercial construction, commercial HVAC in North America, would you say that that's ahead of the market, in line with the market? Do you think you're gaining share generally in commercial HVAC?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, I think it was up about 8% in the quarter which was the strongest quarter we've seen there in some time for commercial HVAC. I think what it really is, Nigel, is just the introduction of new products. We've been talking about the new big chillers that we've got out there, up to 3,000 tons. And this is just really the payoff from the investment that they've been making at the Carrier commercial HVAC business. It's coming through in markets. So I think we're probably gaining a little bit of share. We'll see when the final numbers come out here shortly, but I think we feel pretty good about where we are.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. So it sounds like it a little bit ahead of the market. And then how do you then describe the price/cost dynamic in CCS? Obviously, we're seeing commodity prices moving higher by the week. So how is that looking today? And how is it looking into 2018?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes, that's the several million dollar question for 2018 that we are still working through. Certainly, if you break down the markets, Nigel, I think North America residential business, probably seeing the best level of discipline in terms of passing some of the cost inflation through price increases. Other portions of CCS, not so much. I think commercial HVAC continues to see significant price competition as the fire and security business and the commercial refrigeration business. So I think it's more a phenomena where North America residential feels good in terms of the ability to pass some of the cost inflation. But the other places, probably the dynamic shifts adversely. Both in 2017, we have seen that and I think that pressure will continue in 2018.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Nigel.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, Greg, the hire you made of Judy over at Otis, it's the first outside leader of, if I can recall, for one of your operating segments in some time. So I'm just curious, can you talk about the desire to go outside the organization to look for a President. It's kind of been tougher to find a sticky President in that business for a few years. And also, does this equate to a fresh look for 2020 goals?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Well let me answer the second question first and the answer to that is no. The 2020 goals are the 2020 goals, and Judy and I have had some long conversations about that. I think we've got clear line of sight to the 2020 goals at Otis. I would say when Philippe decided to leave earlier this year, we had a robust slate of internal candidates and there were four or five people that I was confident internally could do a great job running Otis. But I also thought this is an opportunity to look outside to bring some additional talent into the organization. And so we conducted a search. We talked to a lot of folks out there.", "And I got to tell you, when we talked to Judy, I said this is absolutely the right person for the job. She's got a great background. She worked at IBM. She's worked at Lockheed and she's worked at Siemens. And so she's got big company experience. She knows international and I just thought she added a lot to the senior leadership team. And again, it's a unique situation.", "We typically have a very robust leadership development process here, again lots of folks that can do that job. But this is just a unique alignment of the stars, I would say, where we found someone really, really super that I thought would bring the focus on execution as well as a global perspective to Otis. The challenge at Otis, as you guys know, it's a decentralized organization. It's a little bit like herding cats. You've got to have strong process. You've got to have a strong focus on execution. And I think Judy brings all of those things to the table here.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. No, I think it's a good hire. And one follow-up, the size of the UTAS gain, is it $25 million or so, Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. In fact, a little less than that, yes, about (37:50).", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Just to follow up on Otis China. Good news that price pressure doesn't seem to be getting worse. But it's still been tough for a while and now there's probably raw material pressure on top of that. And I guess my question is whether you believe that's starting to impact some of your small competitors more. Do you think you're closer to a shake-out of some of the excess capacity? Are companies more willing to look to partner or get acquired or exit the market? Any market changes you're seeing in Otis China now?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Not to a great extent, Matt. That is our expectation. We are certainly seeing, if you look at the publicly disclosed results of the second-tier players, people underneath Otis, some of who supply to all of the elevator manufacturers in China, they've seen significant profit reductions over the last year, almost 25% or so. And so that situation cannot sustain itself for very long periods of time.", "We haven't quite seen a shakedown or a reduction in order capacity yet. That is what will happen over time, but certainly there is more resilience in the Chinese market. The profit expectations are probably much lower than what Western world would expect. And as a result, companies tend to stay longer than they would in some other markets. But I think that's again a situation which won't last forever. However, it is still continuing and keeping a little bit of pressure on the earnings in China.", "Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just switching gears a little bit on the aftermarket both at Pratt and UTAS, if you could talk about what drove some of the strength. How much was initial provisioning of the benefit, if you can elaborate on that?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Sure. So provisioning was pretty strong at UTAS and some of it is just as a result of the decision we took to reallocate the engines away from the airframe manufacturers, aircraft manufacturers to the spare pool. That is counted as provisioning in the UTAS sales. So that number was higher, to some extent driven by that decision. As Carroll said, that that number unfortunately creates a higher eliminations at UTC level as we have to eliminate the intercompany profit on those transactions.", "Aftermarket at Pratt was up, largely driven by the V2500. The strength there has been continuing. The number of shop visits going again, no surprise there. I think it's coming in a little faster than we had expected. That's why the aftermarket business for Pratt has been growing faster than our original guidance. Let Carroll give additional color on that.", "Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.", "Yes. Sheila, it's a product of both higher volumes and shop visits on the V2500, really good content there as well. The 4s and the 2s, the legacy models, they continue to be in attrition mode and the shop visits were down as we expected, but we saw a bit higher content on our legacy models than we had expected. Some higher life-limited part replacement by some operators that's driving that strength. And as we talked about earlier in the call, some of those going to pull through.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Peter Arment of Baird. Your line is open.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Greg. Greg, a quick one on just on Otis, just circling back. I know you've made a lot of investments in kind of the service transformation. I think you're supposed to have full deployment across all your mobility devices as we get out to 2018. How do we think about just the same profile regarding the E&D investments? I know that was stair stepping up. But should that continue or does it stabilize at some point?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "No, I think, Peter, it's a good question. As you think about first of all in the service deployments, we've got about 13,000 mobile devices out there through the end of the third quarter. As you know, we've got about 31,000 mechanics out there. So we've been rolling these things out, and change management is the key, obviously trying to train the mechanics to use the devices and to get the productivity. So we've been rolling it out quickly, but trying again to do it in a rational fashion. In fact, we probably won't do all 31,000. There will be some markets where it just doesn't make sense. It's not a big enough market to pay for the investment. But we're on track with that initiative.", "Similarly, on the R&D investment, we've stepped it up over these last couple of years. There's not going to be another big increment up in the coming years. I think there's plenty to do right now with the money that we've allocated for R&D. And I think in Otis, as we said, they've doubled the number of new product variations that they can offer and just in the last two years by this increase in R&D. You got to keep in mind that an average R&D program at Otis is somewhere between $1 million and $3 million as opposed to $1 billion and $3 billion on the Aerospace side. So it's obviously a different animal over there, but there's lots to do and I think we've adequately resourced the R&D function at this point.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "That's helpful color. Thanks, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Good morning. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, Doug.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "On UTAS, can you talk about the A320neo Nacelles? And Airbus is moving to take those in-house. And could you walk through what happened there and what you expect to be the impact on UTAS?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "So, okay. It's a great question, Doug, and as with all great questions, it's going to take a little bit of background to fully discuss it. But we have been the supplier of the A320 Nacelle for some period of time. And with the neo, we were selected for the Nacelle for the life of the program. As part of that contract, we were guaranteed all of the volume through the early 2020s, and then that kind of steps down through 2024, where I think we're guaranteed about 50% of the volume.", "Airbus came to us a couple of years ago us and said they were thinking about in-sourcing. They wanted to get pricing from us on the various components so that they could in-source the Nacelle. And we obviously talked a lot to them about that. They decided to go ahead in the mid-2020s to offer a different Nacelle to our customers. At the same time, we'll continue to offer our Nacelle to the customers through the life of the program, as is our right under the contract. And we think, again, we have a great Nacelle. We've got we think to be a competitive one from a cost standpoint and we'll unfortunately be competing with our customer in the offering of that Nacelle in the late 2020s.", "But I got to believe that the customers, once they have the Pratt GTF with the UTAS Nacelle, the switching costs will be somewhat significant. So, I think the prospects of us losing that business completely are pretty low. But we'll keep working with Airbus. And I think we've seen this play before where the aircraft manufacturers decide to in-source, and then after a while they recognize that some things they can do really well and some things not as well as some of their supplies. So we'll keep working with Airbus and we're going to keep our focus on delivering the best quality Nacelle to our customers.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "But you went through the situation with Boeing on the 777 landing gear, where they clearly were looking for a lower price. When you look across these situations, how pervasive do you see this in UTAS where you're getting this additional pressure from the OEMs?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "The focus from the OEMs to reduce cost is never ever ending. We saw it with PFS 1. We've been talking to Boeing about PFS 2. And the fact is, we recognize we have to continue to take cost out of our product if we want to be competitive, and we've told both Boeing and Airbus we'll continue to work with them to find ways to do that across all of the portfolio. But this is not going to end.", "The landing gear was a particularly difficult discussion. We've been making the 777 landing gear for a very, very long time. Boeing asked for a large price reduction, which we could not accommodate, which would have ended up us losing money on a product with no aftermarket. And so we declined and Boeing decided to re-source it, as is their right under the contract. So, we're going to do what's right for the business. I'm not going to start shipping my margin to the OEMs though without some way to recapture that over the long term.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "The other element, Doug, as you well know, on this whole equation is technology, right. So to the extent we can come up with differentiated products that can provide significant value to the customers, whether it's the airlines or the airframers, there should be no reason why we should worry about that. But to the extent we go down the path of offering just commoditized products or print-to-order type of business -", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Build-to-print.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Build-to-print type of business, which will be generally low margin, it's okay if we lose some of that. But it's not going to be just a sheer transfer of margin from our shareholders to somebody else's shareholders with no return for us.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "And if you think about it, the whole premise behind the Rockwell Collins acquisition is to find ways to be more innovative on the airframe, to take weight out, to take cost out and to offer innovative solutions to the airframers. And it's the scale that they bring to us gives us the opportunity to do things that we couldn't do on our own. And I think that's what you have to focus on with the Rockwell Collins, is there is a huge value proposition to our customers with this acquisition.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "But it seems like a tough environment. I would have thought the Goodrich acquisition would also have had that argument I would say even more strongly because there was more overlap.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, there was more overlap from a mechanical systems content standpoint. You're exactly right. But if you think about what's going to drive the next generation of airframe decisions, it's going to be about connected aircraft. It's going to be about communications systems. It's going to be about the ability to take digital across all of the systems on the airframe. And that's one of the benefits to us, is we've got all of these systems that we can now connect and that we can do diagnostics on that can really differentiate our offering and add real value to both the OEMs as well as to the airlines by providing real-time data, real-time diagnostics, real-time spare parts availability.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "All right, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Doug's question, Greg. Boeing will say that they've not seen any benefit from the merger, and that's their objection to Collins. So, if you look at the landing gear, you look at the Nacelle, what would you point to as benefits that they've gotten from the Goodrich acquisition?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, there is something called PFS 1, which was a significant concession on the part of our Aerospace Systems business to take cost out, to reduce the cost to Boeing on the 787. And it was a big bite at the apple, I would tell you. And we have been working, as you know, to try and cover some of those costs. The problem at UTAS today of course is, we don't make any money on any product that we sell to the Boeing Company. None. In fact, we lose money. And so, Dave Gitlin and his whole team are laser focused on how to take cost out to overcome the headwinds associated with all of these new OEM programs versus the old OEM programs.", "I would tell you, Boeing got a benefit from the acquisition. And look, we're six to nine to 12 months away from closing on the Rockwell Collins deal, so I can't comment specifically on where the savings will come from. But I know that Kelly Ortberg and Dave Gitlin have been working, thinking about from an innovation standpoint, what can we do together, where can we take cost out, where can we take weight out, where can we add value across the connected airplanes. So look, it's too early to say, to point specifically to where the benefits will come from. But it's one of the things that we're going to commit to the airlines and to the airframers is we will provide value to you guys because of this.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "And let me just get one follow-up probably for Akhil. To get a low single digit growth at Aero, we need a step-up of a couple of hundred million dollars in revenues in the fourth quarter. Can you just tell us where that may be coming from?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, so George, year-to-date, they're about 1% up. You're talking UTC Aerospace Systems organic growth. 1% is low single digit. And so all they need to do is fourth quarter of something similar. And I think where we see the change happening is their military business, which was down, slightly down in the third quarter, is expected to be up in a decent amount in the fourth quarter. That's based on the timing of some of the programs that shifted from third to fourth quarter. So we feel the ability for UTAS to get the 1% to 2% type of growth in fourth quarter is pretty real, and hopefully we get there.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Thank you, George.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Hayes for closing remarks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thank you, Latoya. So again, a really solid third quarter, good results year-to-date, high confidence in the year. I think that's reflected in the uptick that we gave in the full year guidance. Carroll Lane and the team will be here, along with Akhil, the rest of the day to answer any questions you might have. So I want to thank you all for listening, and have a great day.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC's website at www.utc.com.", "Please note, except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items.", "The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K Reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.", "In addition, in connection with the proposed Rockwell Collins acquisition, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement that includes a prospectus from the UTC and a proxy statement of Rockwell Collins, which is effective which contain important information about UTC, Rockwell Collins, the transaction and related matters.", "Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself in the queue as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay, thank you, Candice, and good early morning to everyone. Appreciate people dialing in a little morning to everyone. Appreciate people dialing in a little early this morning. I know it's a busy day out there.", "2017, a really good year for UTC. We did what we said we would do, and in many cases, we did even a little bit better than what we thought. Our financial results were above the high end of our expectations, and we grew adjusted earnings per share to $6.65, and of course, that's a small beat to the top end of our own expectations range.", "Our sales also topped our expectations and we saw organic sales grow 4%, our best year of organic growth since 2014. And importantly, each of our four business units saw organic growth with Pratt & Whitney leading the way at 9%. We generated stronger- than-expected free cash flow of $3.6 billion while still making substantial strategic investments, and importantly, fully funding our U.S. domestic pension plan.", "On Slide 2 on the webcast. Operationally, we continued to execute against our growing aerospace backlog. At Pratt & Whitney, we shipped 374 Geared Turbofan engines in 2017 and that's right in the middle of our 350 to 400 target and nearly triple our 2016 shipments. And of course, we successfully implemented the engine improvements that we promised to customers in 2017.", "In our commercial businesses where we continued to innovate for growth, our investments are producing results. We gained share and generated solid organic growth at both Otis and in the Carrier business. Otis delivered its best year of organic growth since 2014, and CCS generated 4% organic growth and launched over 100 new products in 2017.", "As you know, we announced the Rockwell Collins acquisition late in the third quarter. This deal will transform our Aerospace Systems business, positioning the United Technologies to enhance customer value in this high-growth end market. We also contributed nearly $2 billion to our domestic pension plan in the third quarter, and that plan is now fully funded. And this will significantly reduce our pension-related earnings volatility going forward.", "On Slide 3. We're clearly pleased with the results we have in 2017, and we get it, you're ready to focus on 2018 and well so are we. And I think, importantly, we're optimistic of the year ahead. Our priorities, though, remain clear and consistent. We're focused on growth through innovation. We'll continue to focus on reducing costs, executing on our commitments to customers and being disciplined in our capital allocation.", "We expect earnings growth in 2018 adjusted earnings growth of $6.85 to $7.10 and that includes the benefit of recently enacted tax reform. More importantly, we expect each of our four business units to grow operating profit in 2018.", "Akhil will come back and talk a lot more about the tax rate in the coming minutes here. Let me just focus on organic sales. Organic sales should accelerate for the fourth straight year with a range of 4% to 6%, supporting sales in the range of $62.5 billion to $64 billion excluding Rockwell Collins. Free cash flow should be in the range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion even as we invest over $4 billion in E&D and CapEx.", "Akhil will take you through the 2018 detail in a few slides, so let me just say that we feel good about the outlook. While there will be challenges to overcome, I think we have a very bright future. Now let me hand over to Carroll who will discuss the fourth quarter business unit results in a little more detail, and I'll come back and wrap it up and then we'll take some questions. Carroll.", "Carroll Lane", "Thanks Greg. I am on Slide 4. The fourth quarter was a good one for UTC, with reported sales of $15.7 billion, up 7%, including 5% organic growth and two points of foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.60 was up 3% from the prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.50 and included $0.07 of restructuring and $1.03 of other non-recurring items.", "Non-recurring items included $722 million for charges related to the recently enacted tax law changes, primarily in the U.S., and the $96 million charge for a product recall at CCS. Our Q4 adjusted effective tax rate was 29%, which brought the full year to 27.8%, now that's 80 basis points above our original expectations for 2017 and so that was an $0.08 headwind to our adjusted EPS results.", "Fourth quarter free cash flow was strong at $1.7 billion. That took our full year cash generation to $3.6 billion, above the high end of our expectations of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. So with that, I'll move on to the segment results and I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency, as we usually do. And just as a reminder, there's an appendix on Slide 19 with additional segment data as a reference.", "All right, starting with Otis. Otis sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, up 3% organically. Operating profit was down 11% at constant currency. Contribution from higher service volume and productivity was more than offset by continued pricing and mix pressure, largely in China, as well as strategic investments in service.", "Foreign exchange translation was a three-point tailwind to sales and a four-point tailwind to earnings. New equipment sales grew 3% mid-teens growth in North America and low double digit growth in Europe were partially offset by an 11% decline in China where the market remains challenging.", "Service sales were up 4%. Otis saw solid growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up low single digit. New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter and grew 5% excluding China.", "North America grew high teens and Europe was up mid-single digits while Asia, excluding China, was up high single digits. This is partially offset by China orders, which were down 7% in value, but up 1% in units with continued improvement in pricing and mix trends, but fewer major project orders. For the full year, Otis operating profit declined $135 million at actual FX on 2% higher organic sales.", "Climate Controls & Security sales grew 6% in the quarter. Operating profit grew 12%. FX translation was a three point tailwind to sales and added two points to earnings. Organic sales growth was 3% in Q4 including 5% growth in global commercial HVAC with gains in every region. Transport refrigeration saw 11% growth and that was primarily driven by a strong recovery in container. Residential HVAC was up low single digits in the quarter.", "Total CCS equipment orders were strong, up 9% in the quarter. That was driven by approximately 20% growth in both global commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. North American residential HVAC and fire and security orders were essentially flat.", "Organic volume contribution in the quarter was offset by pricing and mix headwinds. Productivity gains from restructuring and net favorable year-over-year impact from non-recurring items helped drive 10% profit growth at constant currency. For the full year, CCS operating profit grew $75 million at actual FX on 4% organic sales growth.", "Shifting to Aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales were strong, growing 11% organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket was up 25%. Now you'll recall, last year Q4 was down 6%. The military business saw a mid-teens growth. Commercial OEM sales declined 19% principally due to product mix and lower Pratt & Whitney Canada shipments.", "Geared Turbofan shipments totaled 120 engines in the quarter including those allocated to the spare engine pool. And as Greg mentioned, full year GTF shipments totaled 374 engines. Pratt & Whitney operating profit of $437 million was down $33 million Higher negative engine margin and ramp-related costs were largely offset by aftermarket volume, lower unfavorable contracts adjustments as well as favorable FX and pension.", "For the full year, FX and pension. For the full year, organic sales grew 9%, while operating profit was down $90 million. Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems delivered 3% profit growth on 5% organic sales. Commercial OEM sales were up 2% with growth on new programs more than offsetting declines in legacy program volumes in the quarter.", "Now of note, the end of the Boeing 777 landing gear production at Aerospace Systems impacted commercial OEM sales in the quarter by approximately four points. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 10%. Provisioning was up approximately 20% from growth in intercompany sales to Pratt & Whitney.", "Parts were up 10% and repair was up 2%. Military sales were up 5% in the quarter and that was driven by higher F-35 volumes. Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and military sales, continued product cost reduction and pension tailwind. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable OEM mix and higher SG&A associated with growth initiatives.", "For the full year, Aerospace Systems delivered $103 million of operating profit growth on 2% higher organic sales. So with that, let me hand it over to Akhil who's going to provide more detail on the 2018 outlook. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Carroll. Before I get into the details, a couple of points to note. First, our 2018 outlook includes the impact of revenue recognition changes adopted prospectively on January 1. Now as we have said previously, the impact is not expected to be significant at any of the business units. Second, the outlook is on a stand-alone basis for UTC. It does not include any impact from the proposed Rockwell Collins transaction.", "As you can see on Slide 10, the global macroeconomic environment is expected to remain robust in 2018. In the U.S., we are expecting modest acceleration with growth above 2.5%. Construction and housing trends still look relatively strong here. Conditions in Western Europe have been improving and we see that in our order rates. China reported strong fourth quarter GDP and will likely grow above 6% again in 2018. That said, construction-related end markets in China for us will remain under price pressure, although perhaps not quite as bad as we saw in 2016 and 2017.", "And we'll likely see a little tailwind from FX as the dollar has been weakening recently. Now in the box on the lower left of that slide, you can see some of the key FX rates we have assumed in our 2018 outlook. The macroeconomic environment and our solid backlog give us confidence in the 2018 organic sales growth outlook of 4% to 6%.", "As you can see on Slide 11, for the commercial businesses in the Americas, we expect 2% to 4% organic growth for both Otis and CCS, and that's on top of a solid high base that we have seen in the recent years.", "In EMEA, we anticipate 1% to 3% sales growth where we expect significant improvement in the commercial HVAC business for CCS. And both China and Asia outside of China should see better trends compared to 2017.", "On the aerospace side, we will continue to see solid growth in commercial aftermarket and military sales. Commercial OEM sales should grow 5% to 7% in 2018 largely driven by the higher GTF deliveries.", "So on Slide 12, before I get into specific segment expectations, let me talk about the impact from adoption of the new accounting standard for pension. As you know, this change will move all pension-related income and charges except for service costs below operating profit. Now there'll be no change to UTC's overall EPS, but segment numbers will change. The table on the left shows you the restated 2017 results and we just are providing this so you can update your models to account for this change.", "As we have said before, we expect sales and adjusted operating profit to grow in all four businesses. Detailed assumptions for the segments including the profit walks, as usual, are available in the appendix.", "But let me summarize these here. At Otis, we expect low to mid-single- digit sales growth in 2018. New equipment will be up low single digits and service up mid-single-digit. China new equipment will be down low single digit, an improvement compared to down 10% in 2017. Europe service business is expected to grow again slightly with improving trends in the more profitable maintenance business.", "On profits, we anticipate Otis to be flat to up $50 million at constant currency, driven by lower pricing headwind and the benefits from volume and productivity. Translation FX should provide about $25 million of tailwind. CCS sales will be up mid-single digits with growth in all business units. We will see continued strong performance in residential HVAC business, solid growth in the global commercial HVAC business, and better growth and mix in transport refrigeration.", "Operating profit will be up $125 million to $175 million at actual FX, with the improved volume mix and pricing more than offsetting commodities pressure and investments in E&D and sales force to support growth.", "At Pratt & Whitney, sales will be up low teens. GTF volumes will ramp again significantly and we expect to see higher shipments at Pratt Canada. Commercial aftermarket should grow around 10%, primarily driven by higher V2500 shop visits. The military business will also see benefits from higher Joint Strike Fighter engine shipments.", "On the profit side, the growth in GTF segments will result in additional negative engine margin headwind, as we have previously discussed. That will be more than offset by solid growth in commercial aftermarket and military. Overall, we expect Pratt operating profit to increase between $25 million to $75 million.", "Aerospace Systems will grow the top line low single digits with commercial OE up low single digits including one quarter of impact from the loss of the Boeing 777 landing gear business that we have talked about in 2017. The aftermarket and the military businesses will be up low to mid-single digits.", "On the profit side, lower commercial OEM mix headwind net of cost reductions, combined with solid conversion on commercial aftermarket and military sales, should result in strong operating profit growth of $150 million to $200 million. Collectively, the four segments will grow earnings between 4% to 6% over the pension-adjusted 2017 results, a positive change from the last couple of years.", "On Slide 13, you will see our EPS walk for 2018. The segments will contribute $0.39 at the midpoint of their outlook range. The new tax changes are expected to lower our effective tax rate to 25.5% versus the 27.8% in 2017. And I know that one of the key questions on your mind, so why 25.5%? Well, as you know, about 60% of our earnings come from overseas.", "With the U.S. federal tax rate at 35%, our blended global rate was about 30%. We used to get a couple of points of credits that got us down to the 28% effective tax rate that you've been seeing for the past few years. These credits go away under the new rules, so you're starting from a 30% blended rate. Now the benefit from recent U.S. tax law changes is a federal rate reduction of 14 points from 35 to 21. And that is on 40% of our earnings.", "So given no other changes, simple math would suggest our new rate should be 24.5%. However, under the new tax laws, there are some provisions that add another point for base broadening and that is how we get to 25.5%. As we all know new notifications and clarifications are still being written and we will continue to monitor these for any potential benefits that can help drive the ongoing tax rate lower.", "On the other hand, these notifications and other refinements in the calculations will likely increase the tax-related onetime charge that we took in fourth quarter over the next four quarters. Finally, the tax law changes will result in a net $1.5 billion estimated cumulative cash payment on previously earned foreign income. This amount will be paid through 2026. That's probably enough on taxes, right?", "Getting back to the rest of the EPS walk. Pension will be a $0.19 tailwind, mainly due to our 2017 voluntary contribution. On the other side, interest expense will be an $0.11 headwind due to the full year impact of Q2 2017 borrowings as well as higher interest rates. And again, as a reminder, we are not including any expense for Collins-related debt.", "In terms of other big items below the segment profit. Corporate expense, eliminations and others will be an $0.18 headwind. And on the slide, you can see the contributors such as change in the mark-to-market accounting that we have talked about, higher intercompany eliminations and some settlements and other credits we got in 2017.", "As usual, our EPS range of $6.85 to $7.10 includes contingency to account for the unexpected, it's $120 million at the midpoint. In summary, we feel good about EPS growth outlook with all four business units contributing. As in the prior years, our earnings growth will be weighted more towards the back half of the year as we get the benefit of cost reduction efforts. We expect Q1 EPS to be basically flat to 2017, primarily driven by the profile of the commercial businesses.", "With that, let me hand it back over to Greg.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I hope you guys got all that. The good news is, of course, Carroll and his team will be around later to help take you through all of the detail on taxes and pensions and all the other good stuff. But let me just say I feel good about the quarter that just ended, but I feel even better as we look forward into 2018 because those investments that we've been making, the strategic investments at Otis, the big R&D investments on the aerospace businesses, the new product development at CCS, all of that is actually paying off.", "And not only will they pay off in 2018, but they'll pay off well into the future. A year ago, I told you we were excited about where we were, that we were on the cusp of seeing returns on the investments. Well, those returns are happening in 2018 and we expect accelerating organic sales and earnings growth with strong cash flows.", "At Rockwell Collins, we continue to expect the transaction to close around the middle of the year. Of course, it's pending regulatory approvals. As you saw, Rockwell Collins shareholders overwhelmingly approved the deal a couple of weeks ago, and Dave Gitlin, Kelly Ortberg and the team are preparing to execute a successful integration that will create value not only for customers, but also for shareowners.", "Bottom line, though, on 2020 growth objectives is we remain confident. The business unit presidents will actually get a chance, in March we're going to have everybody stand up to take you back through their 2020 objectives, both the top and the bottom line at our annual Investor Day. I think it's important to remember that each of us at United Technologies is focused on a shared set of priorities and that's, first of all, delivering on our commitments, innovating for growth and driving to long long-term shareowner value.", "So with that, I'm mindful of the time, let's open up the call for questions, Candace. See what's on everybody's mind. Thanks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Steve Tusa", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Hey, Steve.", "Steve Tusa", "On CCS, yes, obviously, pretty good orders on the commercial front. I think you're guiding positive price costs in the bridge, if I'm right about that. Can you talk about what's happening on commodities and then pricing in commercial HVAC as well as residential HVAC?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure. So I think for next year, Steve, as you can \u2013 as we've talked about before, commodities is going to be a headwind, copper, steel, all those important inputs had been going up in price, and there's about a $50 million headwind at CCS next year. CCS has put through some price increases as some of the other players in the industry. Certainly, on the residential HVAC side in North America, we see a little better traction in terms of the prices being passed through to the consumers. Ultimately, we'll see how that all plays out when the season comes in on the cooling side, so that's still a bit of a wild card. But I think the discipline appears to be there and we feel good about that.", "Commercial HVAC is a little bit more challenging. We are expecting that trend to change and improve and the plan assumes a change in the trend there. Again, prices have been increased. The big markets where we have seen the pressure have been China and Middle East and we are seeing a little bit of moderation, but not much. I would say you're actually pushing on the right button here. The key assumption in CCS is our ability to get pricing next year. We have assumed a net $50 million benefit, but that, I would say, is the one watch item to still observe as the year progresses.", "Steve Tusa", "So are you assuming any price in commercial globally?", "Akhil Johri", "We are assuming some price increase in 2018, yes. A modest amount.", "Steve Tusa", "Yes, okay. Great, thanks a lot guys. Thanks for detailed visual.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks.", "Akhil Johri", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Matt McConnell", "Thank you, good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matt McConnell", "So on free cash flow, I'm calculating a conversion of something in the mid-80% range for 2018. First, does that sound right? And could you talk through some of the drivers? I know there might be more cash tax for foreign earnings. And are there other working capital requirements? Or was 2017 a CapEx peak? Just help us walk through some of those drivers.", "Akhil Johri", "Sure. I think the math you're doing, Matt, is based off the adjusted net income. I think what you need to look at is the reported net income because obviously you have \u2013 the cash number that we talked to you guys about is the reported cash number. It's not for adjusted. So then you take into account things like the restructuring cash expenses that will be there.", "Also even though we have not included anything for Rockwell post close, the first part of the year we have some expenses associated with the integration work of Rockwell that comes in with about a charge, which will again flow through our cash flow. Not included in our adjusted earnings, but flows through our cash flow. So when you adjust for all that, we have between 92% to 95% is [Audio Gap] $2 billion. Also, we have the \u2013 roughly $200 million to $250 million of payment to the Canadian government for the royalties that we had in Canada. The reality is with all that pressure, we feel pretty good about our cash performance. Actually, just for kicks, we did this math \u2013 I had the guys do this math for 2017. When you adjust all the noise out, pension, the Canadian royalty, et cetera, we actually ended up with 99% of adjusted free cash flow to net income.", "Not a bad performance given that our CapEx was $2 billion, which will not stay at that level forever and given that we are still investing in our inventory for \u2013 to support our high organic growth expectations. So that's \u2013 it's a pretty good performance in cash flow, same thing for 2018. And I do expect for the metrics to truly convert back to over 100% by 2020 when the CapEx starts to go down a little bit.", "Matt McConnell", "Okay, all right. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is now open.", "Carter Copeland", "Hi, good morning, gentlemen.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "Carter Copeland", "Just a quick elaboration question. I wondered, Akhil, if you could tell us \u2013 just elaborate on the lower unfavorable cume adjustments in Pratt that was in the release, just what that related to? And Greg, you hinted at still being optimistic about Collins. I wondered if you could just give us an update, obviously some moving things there in terms of potentially funding and costs, but as well as the more you get the chance to look at it, Dave and Kelly and the guys, how are you feeling about the synergy target and the accretion targets you guys laid out? And any update there that you can give us?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure. Carter, I'll do the easy one first and let Greg answer the Collins one. But I think the Pratt one is a simple thing. If you go back and look at our script from last year fourth quarter, there was a significant charge that \u2013 or adjustment that we had booked at Pratt for some unfavorable EACs and all we are talking about is the benefit this year that Pratt saw from lower negative adjustments this year. So it's just a favorable year-over-year compare. That's all.", "Carter Copeland", "Akhil, can you remind us what program that was on? Was that V2500?", "Akhil Johri", "It was PW4000 principally, but a little bit of V2500 as well, yes.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay, thanks.", "Greg Hayes", "Okay. Carter, on Rockwell, I think a couple of important points to make. We still do expect to close sometime here in midyear. We're working through the second request with the DOJ right now. And nothing has really come up from a regulatory standpoint that surprises us here, so we feel really good about getting this done. I think, importantly \u2013 or more importantly, though, is the cash aspect of the deal where we had originally expected to fund part of this through foreign cash, we're going to bring back about $1 billion a year to pay down the debt.", "We now see a line of sight to bring back at least $3 billion this year, maybe a tiny bit more and a lot more than $1 billion a year for the next couple of years. So I think we'll be able to pay off the Rockwell debt a lot faster. The deal obviously looks a lot better, too, from an NPV basis because of the lower tax rate. As you know, Rockwell is primarily U.S. domestic income and so at a 35% rate that we assumed in the model, that 21% rate looks pretty doggone good. So feel good about that. I spent some time two weeks ago with Kelly Ortberg and Dave Gitlin. I think we've got a line of sight to what the organization should look like post merger.", "But more importantly, I think the guys have a really good handle on the integration opportunities and the synergy opportunities. We're going to push for $500 million of net synergies. I know the list is a lot bigger, it'll shrink over time, but we are clearly on a path to get those synergies over the next few years. And this is going to be a great deal for customers as well as shareholders of this whole thing. It's done, so feel really good about it today.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay, thanks for the color, guys.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks Carter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Akhil Johri", "Hi Noah.", "Noah Poponak", "Hi, Akhil. Hey, Greg and Akhil, so you've got a 2016 to 2020 organic revenue CAGR outlook that, depending on exactly where you pick to land in the range of each business, and I guess exactly how you define 10%-plus at Pratt, looks like it averages kind of 6.5%, maybe even 7% organic revenue growth 2016 to 2020. And you just put up 4% for 2017. Your guidance for 2018 at the midpoint is 5%.", "So in order to get to that, just mathematically, 2019 and 2020 would need to average something in the zone of 8%. Is that what you're saying? Is that what you're standing by today? And if so, how much of that is the 10%-plus at Pratt just having a big year or two because of GTF versus how much of it is meaningful acceleration in the rest of the business?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. Noah, I think you're right on in terms of the Pratt when we point that 10%-plus. Obviously, Pratt, huge Q4 here, a great year in 2017 and growth will accelerate at Pratt this year. GTF deliveries were 374 last year and we'll almost double that again this year. So think about production going up quite a bit in 2018 and then it will go up again in 2019. And keep in mind, there's 8,000 engines in backlog. So the preponderance of the growth will come from Pratt & Whitney in terms of overall UTC.", "The Aerospace Systems guys, they've got a good shot, but probably towards the lower end of the range there in terms of organic growth that we laid out. Obviously, the loss of the 777 landing gear was important in 2017 that cost some four points of growth. But they see growth accelerating. They get the headwinds behind them. And importantly, I think they've got a lot of new programs that are coming online, which is going to help. In Pratt, keep in mind, too, it's not just GTF, it's also JSF.", "We also have the PW800 up at Pratt Canada, the new Gulfstream engine. So there is real growth out there. This is not just pie-in-the-sky on the aerospace side. And the Aerospace Systems guys benefit from all that Pratt growth as well because they have the engine controls and accessories on all their engines. On the commercial side, it'll be a little bit more challenging. I think, Otis, pretty good line of sight there, but it will depend on China. Yes, we're expecting China to stabilize. Clearly, we saw good growth throughout Asia last year x China, still strong growth in North America and a really strong recovery in Europe.", "So again, I think you'll see accelerating growth. Backlog is way up at Otis in new equipment. Service is coming back. So yes, I think we can get there. And then, CCS, again, I think the biggest question mark, and a little disappointed in fourth quarter performance at CCS. But importantly, they put 130 new products out in the field last year. They got another 100 coming this year. The E&D investments are starting to pay off and that's what, I know, Bob McDonough and team are banking on in terms of what's going to accelerate growth for them.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes. And even on CCS, Noah, keep in mind, I mean, their backlog is good. They've had great order growth on the equipment side, 9% organic order growth on the equipment side in fourth quarter, pretty strong, pretty solid. So I think we do feel the comment about Greg's disappointment with CCS on fourth quarter was more related to the drop-through, not so much the top line. I think we do feel very, very strong and very good about their ability to continue to get results from their investment in innovation and the new products that they're bringing to the marketplace. So things feel okay as well.", "Noah Poponak", "Great.", "Akhil Johri", "But you'll have a chance to ask the presidents these questions in detail when they stand up in March as well.", "Noah Poponak", "Yes, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Ron Epstein", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning, Ron.", "Ron Epstein", "Can you walk through Pratt in a little more color? It was a pleasant surprise to see the uplift in the underlying earnings at Pratt next year. And is that V2500, is that PW4000 because, for sure, we're seeing a pickup in the freighter markets and you guys have a lot of engines in that market. Or is that GTF related?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure, Ron. I think, yes, the big driver for the commercial aftermarket, which is probably what you are referring to, the 10% growth, right, I mean, the GTF and the military engine business not really surprising just given the outlook for the engine shipments that we have. On the commercial aftermarket side, clearly, it's V2500. They are entering into the sweet spot, as we have talked about for a few years now, right? I mean, a lot of them, the average age of the fleet is a little over \u2013 is about nine years or so. First overhauls are coming in for a lot of those engines. We expect worldwide shop visits to be around 10% growth in 2018.", "And that's what drives a lot of that commercial aftermarket assumption. On the OE side, I would tell you this. I think it's \u2013 Pratt is finally back in the large commercial engine \u2013 large engine business. If you look at overall production for next year, I think, finally, we will be over 1,000 large engines. This was last achieved by Pratt in the early 1980s. So it's a long time coming, but we are finally there and that number will only continue to grow as we look forward. So we feel really good about.", "And then the third element of Pratt is the Pratt Canada business. And not just because of the PW800 that Greg referred to, we expect to see engine shipments to start growing in the other small engine segments as well. The helicopter market is bottoming out and hopefully starts to improve. There is an improving sentiment about the business jet market. We'll see whether that turns around or not, but we certainly have a market share gain with the Gulfstream. So I think it's all feeling like it's coming together, and this is an often used phrase, but it feels like Pratt is firing on all cylinders.", "Ron Epstein", "And at Pratt, I mean, is this year going to be the peak in the headwind for the GTF? Is that how we should be thinking about it? And what will that headwind be?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, we've talked about the 2018 as the headwind \u2013 as the peak year for negative engine margin headwind on a year-over-year basis and in terms of absolute numbers and that number is going to be approximately $1.1 billion, as we have said before, right? So it will be the peak. In 2019, the volume increases will be there, but that'll be offset by the cost reduction benefits.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay, great. Thank you very much, Akhil.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Ron.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Hi, good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning, Sheila.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Just on the portfolio update. As you think about the Collins transaction nearing and tax reform changes, how do you think about the portfolio from here? Any divestments needed to delever? If you could give some color there?", "Greg Hayes", "Yes. We've talked about we'll look at the portfolio post Rockwell and our thinking really hasn't changed there. I would tell you, with tax reform, the ability to delever is significantly enhanced just with having access to our foreign cash without having to pay a second toll tax on it. So I wouldn't think there is anything out there that we have to divest as a part of our deleveraging scheme. At the same time, I would tell you we're continuing to look at the entire portfolio, things that makes sense, things that don't make sense and we'll continue to evaluate what we're going to do longer term. Right now, of course, the focus is on getting it closed, getting it financed and then we'll come back to you guys with, I think, a more detailed look at everything.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Great.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.", "Jeff Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Greg Hayes", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague", "Just a couple of quick things here for me. Just first on Otis, China, particularly. I guess it still isn't really clear if pricing has stabilized there. But can you give a little bit of color of how you see the year playing out, Otis China price specifically? And then I was also wondering, on CCS, it looks like there was a recall in the fourth quarter. What does that relate to? Is that some legacy products or something new? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.", "Akhil Johri", "So on the Otis part, Otis China, again, I think you are referring to the disconnect between the dollar value in orders of down 7% and units up one point. That's \u2013 the eight-point difference is very consistent with what we have reported the last couple of quarters. The difference, Jeff, this time was that when we look \u2013 when we typically break that gap between three pieces, price, mix and major projects, right, because major projects can have a significant impact. They come with higher dollar value with fewer units. This quarter, for the same time, major projects more than explained the entire eight-point disconnect.", "So price/mix was actually slightly positive for the first time in many, many quarters that we have seen that. That's a change in trend that we are hoping will continue. Now one quarter doesn't make a trend, you'll remind me, but it\u2019s the beginning, and we hope that continues. That's what the assumption is in the plan, that pricing stabilizes and becomes slightly positive as we go forward for China. Obviously, because of the negative price/mix in the backlog, the sales in 2018 will still have some negative impacts coming through as well the margins, which is why we have forecasted China to be down slightly low single-digit in the new equipment sales next year. But the order trends more encouraging in Q4 even in China than what we have seen historically.", "Greg Hayes", "On the CCS side, Jeff, that\u2019s the fire extinguisher, the Kidde U.S. fire extinguisher recall. You\u2019ll recall that we started talking about this. In the third quarter, we took a small charge at CCS for what we thought was the amount of the recall. But as the quarter progressed, what we saw was a much higher return rate than we have seen historically. A lot of these fire extinguishers are not just sold to consumers, but also to businesses and the businesses, be it the Coast Guard or the police, have a much higher return rate than what consumers typically do.", "And so as the quarter progressed and we saw the return rates spiking significantly, we took another look at the reserve for that and we booked what we think is the \u2013 is an adequate reserve we\u2019ll see over time here. But hopefully, this is behind us now in terms of the financial impact of this fire extinguisher recall. Remember, these go back 20-some years. So while it\u2019s a big number in the context of the business, over some 20 years of production, it\u2019s not that significant. It\u2019s still a very profitable business long term. And we did the right thing here in terms of the product recall with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We\u2019ve gone out, we\u2019ve advertised to get these things back and just trying to correct what was unfortunately a manufacturing error.", "Jeff Sprague", "Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good morning.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning, Sam.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Greg, you had talked a little bit about the Rockwell Collins transaction and the discussions with the regulators. When this was first announced, certainly the large OEMs were saying they didn\u2019t see a lot of benefit from it, which clearly was a negotiating tactic. They have been talking a lot about that, so can we read that as you\u2019ve come to some agreement in terms of concessions? And anything you can add about how the OEMs are viewing the transaction now?", "Greg Hayes", "Well, Sam, we have clearly been talking to both the OEMs as well as to the airlines about the benefits of the deal. It\u2019s no surprise, I think the big OEMs are skeptical just in terms of what they perceive to be market power of a combined Rockwell and the Aerospace Systems business. But our message has been clear since day 1, which was we think this will add value to the customers over the long term. We\u2019re working with the OEMs now to get this thing finalized and hopefully we\u2019re not going to see big objections. But in terms of sentiments and all that, I\u2019m not going to comment on that other than to say that we\u2019re talking to folks on a daily basis and we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to prevent this deal from getting done.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Your line is now open.", "Peter Arment", "Okay, thanks. Good morning, Greg and Akhil.", "Greg Hayes", "Good morning.", "Peter Arment", "Greg, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get a lot of details at GTF in March. But maybe you could just give us some additional color of how you\u2019re seeing the production going, the fixes that are being put in place and obviously thoughts on maybe spare engine volume in 2018. Thanks.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, it\u2019s good question and I\u2019m noting this is, I think, the ninth question and the first one on GTF, so that\u2019s a significant improvement as we\u2019ve seen in the field on the GTF, I might add. So just put it in context, we\u2019ve got about 500,000 hours today on the GTF. Dispatch reliability is 99.88%. That\u2019s all pretty good. And importantly, the number of AOGs or aircraft on ground waiting for spares is less than a handful. And in fact, we\u2019ve got more spares than we need today, which is fine because as we\u2019d talked before, we\u2019ll be retrofitting a number of these engines to incorporate the fixes for engines that were produced last year.", "Every engine that\u2019s going out the door today has the two big fixes in it, that is for the number three seal as well as for the improved combustor liner. And I think all of those are contributing to the success or the reliability that the airlines are seeing today. The challenge in 2018 is you will have to do a number of overhauls for those engines that are already shipped. That\u2019s in the plan. We think we\u2019ve got adequate capacity to do that and adequate spares. We had more than 40 extra spares \u2013 40 spares at the end of the year. We\u2019ll make more this year, but we certainly won\u2019t make them at the same ratio that we did last year as you double in production. You\u2019re going to see a huge ramp-up in \u2013 at Airbus as well as increase at Bombardier. So I feel pretty good about the GTF today.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes. And keep in mind, with the fuel burn benefit that GTF provides, which is substantial, I mean, the airlines are seeing significant benefit. And with the fuel prices rising, which is a concern that we keep reading about nowadays, I think that\u2019s \u2013 even makes it an even more attractive engine to have on the aircraft. So I think it\u2019s all helped.", "Greg Hayes", "Yes, I think the one word that I would say summarizes the success of the GTF is Delta. The fact is Delta showed high confidence in the Bob Leduc and the Pratt team in selecting the engine in December to power their A321 fleet. Delta is a very sophisticated customer with Delta TechOps. They wouldn\u2019t have selected it if they didn\u2019t think it was the right engine with all the attributes that we\u2019ve been talking about with fuel burn and noise and reliability.", "Peter Arment", "Appreciate the color. Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Winoker of UBS. Your line is now open.", "Steven Winoker", "Thanks. Good morning, Greg, Akhil, Carroll. Greg, love to get a sense for where service attachment rates are for Otis these days in China and where you see that trending. And then if you could also kind of clarify your comment or Akhil\u2019s comment that your disappointment on CCS in the drop-through, was that mostly the product recall related? Was it price raws time frame and lag or factory absorption? What were your concerns thereto?", "Akhil Johri", "So first one, Steve, on the China conversion rates, we saw some improvement there. The rate now \u2013 as you know, it, for a long time had been in the low 30s. We ended 2017 with a 39% conversion rate, which was encouraging. But that\u2019s, for the long time, we have said, look, it\u2019ll be a slow progress. It is not going to overnight go back to the Western phenomena of above 80% conversion. And what we mean by conversion is new equipments coming off warranty and getting into a service contract.", "So encouraging sign of progress, but it is going to be that level of progress every year as we continued to focus on more and more service in China. With regard to CCS, I think the comment Greg made, the disappointment, it was largely the mix factor that we didn\u2019t see can change that dramatically. There were also a couple of issues with our new products in the commercial refrigeration space where we were expecting cost reductions to come in at a faster rate, but unfortunately the factory performance was a little short of our expectations and we ended up having \u2013 not seeing the level of cost reduction that had been anticipated in that business. But it was more about that and a little less improvement in pricing, particularly on commercial HVAC. So I think those three factors are what ended up to the disappointment in the CCS numbers, as Greg referred to earlier.", "Steven Winoker", "And was that specifically Linde factories on the commercial refrigerator or was it someplace else? Or it was on the transport side, right?", "Greg Hayes", "No, it was primarily the old Linde business and it was just additional volume coming through the factories. We just couldn\u2019t get folks \u2013 not surprisingly, we moved the factories to Czech Republic a number of years ago and unemployment there is about 2%. We had a hard time getting people into the factories to build the product, and as a result, the costs were just higher than what we expected. On the container side, I think we had some adverse mix, but really it was the commercial refrigeration, the factory performance, that really wasn\u2019t up to expectations.", "Akhil Johri", "Right. And keep in mind, commercial refrigeration in Europe, the Linde business you talk about, Steve, is just about $1 billion of the total $17 billion, $18 billion that CCS has. So other factory performance, whether it\u2019s Mexico or Collierville or Indianapolis, all going extremely well. So it\u2019s not a systemic issue, it was just a lot of orders coming in and new products and that cost reduction not happening at the pace we expected or wanted.", "Steven Winoker", "Okay, sounds real and not a problem to have. Thanks, guys. Be in touch.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.", "Cai Von Rumohr", "Yes. Thank you very much. So Akhil, you did a great job of explaining the difference in the tax rate. Given that, presumably, you have to pay something for repatriation 8%, you get bonus depreciation, what is the all-in cash flow impact of the tax law change on 2018?", "Akhil Johri", "Not a huge number, Cai, for a variety of reasons, right, in 2018. For the entire period over through 2026, we will have a $1.5 billion net payment that we have talked about. But a small portion of that \u2013 as you know, there is a graded payment that the government has allowed. And net of any credits that we get, the impact in 2018 is not meaningful, not that significant.", "Cai Von Rumohr", "Got it. And then you said you were going to bring $3-plus billion back. I mean, given that you have $7.5 billion to $8 billion abroad, how come not bring back more so you can whack more of the Collins debt? And given that you are bringing some back and can do that, does this bring you closer to the point at which, I think you guys once said, you might consider breaking up the company?", "Akhil Johri", "Well, let me answer the first one. The $8 billion of cash that you referred to, keep in mind that lot of that is related to our partners that we have, particularly in China, that Otis and Carrier has. So not that entire amount of cash, even though it shows up on our balance sheet, is not our cash per se. There is minority partner share in that cash, which belongs to them obviously. Also, through the Pratt joint ventures or collaboration agreements that we have, there is a significant amount of cash that is due to our collaboration partners that is sitting overseas as well. And then there are constraints that we have to look at such as withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions, et cetera.", "So our tax and treasury guys work very closely together to try and optimize the most cost-effective way of bringing the cash back. At this point, we believe we can do $3 billion out of the $8 billion. Now we'll continue to push that and hopefully we can do more than that. But at this point, it's safe to assume $3 billion, at least that's the good news of the tax reform. The other point is that not only about the cash that is on the balance sheet today, but the access to cash as we generate going forward and being able to bring that back is what will help us delever faster than what we had originally anticipated.", "So we'll be able to access cash. We generate over $3 billion internationally every year and that \u2013 having the ability to bring some of that cash back would be very meaningful from that perspective. With regard to the portfolio question, look, nothing has changed with regard to our thinking that we have discussed with you guys periodically and often. We will continue to look at all the options. We'll continue to look at that. But the first priority is to close Rockwell, get the synergies, get the integration done and delever so we can get back to our A rating before we have any conversation of any meaning on portfolio.", "Cai Von Rumohr", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Doug Harned", "Thank you, good morning. I wanted to go back to the GTF, a second question on it. Now that you're getting the fixes in place and you look forward, obviously the incident has been \u2013 it\u2019s been a challenging start. When you think about the aftermarket going forward, can you talk about how you see the profitability of that aftermarket over the next couple of years relative to your expectations? And given that these are going to be heavily on fleet management programs, when should we start seeing a material positive cash impact coming off of the aftermarket for the GTF?", "Greg Hayes", "First of all, Doug, I think the GTF aftermarket, right, these engines will be out there for 20 or 25 years. Almost all of 80% of the engines today are going out under some type of an FMP of or management plan. A portion of those are actually paying cash on an hourly basis, the other at \u2013 for shop overhaul. But again, these first business that we're going to see this year, we won't see any additional cash for those because this is really under warranty as we put the fixes into the fleet.", "So realistically, you're talking 2020, 2021 when we really start to see the aftermarket from the GTF start to be a meaningful part of the Pratt story. The good news, of course, is, in the interim, you've got the V2500, which, as Akhil mentioned, probably over 1,000 shop visits this year and probably next and it still is in that kind of sweet spot. So our GTF is still a few years out, the V is exactly where we had expected it to be and the aftermarket is as strong as we could have hoped there. So I don't see any big changes there, it just takes time.", "Doug Harned", "So presumably, in a fleet management program, obviously you're making estimates on risks and costs and so forth and that's all in your pricing. So you haven't seen any changes to your expectations based on some of the early challenges the engines had in terms of what you expect that profitability to be?", "Greg Hayes", "No. I think, overall, it is about as we had expected. Obviously, we don't specifically plan for these two issues that we had. But given the nature of \u2013 the long-term nature of the contracts and the costs of the overhauls and the work because this is not a significant impact to the overall fleet profitability as you think about what is about 8,000 engines that we've sold so far, I think the best thing to think about that, Doug, going forward, there are still 3,000 Airbus aircraft out there that haven't had an engine selection on it yet. And I think given the success we had in the fourth quarter and what we're seeing from the operators today, we think we'll get our fair share of those. So hopefully, it'll be better even than what we're currently anticipating.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes. The good news, Doug, if any, is that in these problems, I mean, with every engine that we have out there, sometimes we do encounter problems which require costs to be incurred on the FMP programs, the good news is having caught the problems early, we have fewer engines to worry about with regard to that incremental cost, if any. And over the years, our experience has been that the engineering teams, along with the manufacturing teams, continue to work on improving the quality and the performance of the engines through cost reduction efforts and others, which will then help improve the projections that we might have at this point of time. It goes both ways, but overall I think we feel good about where things are.", "Doug Harned", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.", "George Shapiro", "Yes. A question on Pratt's margin. First, it seems like you must have shipped maybe another 30 or 40 spare GTFs in the quarter. I just want to know whether that was accurate statement and that's a big part of the reason you had the 25% sales growth in aftermarket. And the second is, which seemed to me, with the aftermarket up that high, that Pratt's margin should have been higher than what you reported. So I just wondered if you could provide some added color on that. Thanks.", "Akhil Johri", "George, first of all, the any spare engines sold don't go through the aftermarket numbers. That generally goes into our OE count itself if there are spare engines sold as part of the overall campaigns. Secondly, the conversion point, I think one of the things we have talked about \u2013 you and I talked about a little bit, is that the traditional old margin rates on aftermarket that we used to get on JT8Ds, JT9Ds or PW4000s was much higher than what we expect to get on V2500, first of all, because there is the payment to Rolls-Royce that we have for buying over their portion of the business, that comes with higher intangible amortization associated with that transaction and there is a significant amount of more engine services model that we have.", "So our net conversion or drop-through on commercial aftermarket under the new programs is a low \u2013 is a little lower than what was traditional old margin expectations that you've seen on the Pratt engine models. So both those things actually explain the conversion. The conversion we are seeing is not different than what we expected. The higher growth rate was from V2500.", "And some of it also comes from our \u2013 from the engine services we provide on some of the other engine models, which does not come through with great drop-through like we have for China Eastern. We have CFM engines that we service in our Shanghai engine center and that, as you can imagine, comes with very little conversion, right? So it's a combination of those factors is what explains the Pratt aftermarket.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And can you validate, Akhil, whether I'm at all in the ballpark in terms of the spare engines in the quarter?", "Akhil Johri", "No, I don't know \u2013 I don't think we have given that and we don't want to get into that, George.", "George Shapiro", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Akhil Johri", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Greg Hayes for closing remarks.", "Greg Hayes", "Thanks, Candace.

But Carroll and Nathan and Devin will be here all day to answer any questions you guys have, so feel free to give us a call. And have a great day. Thanks, all.
