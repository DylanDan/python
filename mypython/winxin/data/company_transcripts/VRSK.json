This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's EVP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen.", "Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.", "David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Teresa, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for discussion of our first quarter 2017 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities, the financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.", "The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures, which we'll reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail, in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks, David. Good morning, everybody. Yesterday, we reported an unusual quarter with a number of items that we don't expect to recur that affected us at a moment in time. We are comfortable that growth will be better the rest of the year and into 2018. For the full-year of 2017, we continue to expect combined insurance and financial services revenue to grow about in line within historical trend.", "Reported revenue grew 2% for the quarter. Organic constant-currency growth was 2.5%. Profitability remained strong, with total EBITDA margins around 49%. We chose to grow expenses at a measured pace in the quarter to support future growth. Diluted adjusted EPS declined about 1% as a result of unusual conditions influencing revenue growth. In spite of this, free cash flow in the quarter was up about 12%.", "Revenue growth was muted because of one-time true up revenue in Decision Analytics in 2016, several contract completions at Argus and the cycling through of WoodMac contracts that were signed in the depth of the oil commodity down cycle. Looking ahead, our confidence is based on new contracts and new solutions layered on top of the stability our subscription revenue provides.", "Specifically, we expect new sources of insurance revenue growth, several new Argus contracts where the signing slipped out of the first quarter and moderating effects of the commodity and currency headwinds as we move through 2017. We were pleased that in our resource businesses in the quarter, we saw a healthy and encouraging growth in contract signings for subscription products.", "Our teams are working hard on all the new solutions in which we are investing and long-term opportunities remain robust. We are focusing on both acquiring talent and shaping our workforce, so that it reflects the right mix of capabilities to run our business. We are also investing in our new solution opportunities, because we're confident in the near and the long-term revenue outlooks, continuing to invest in our people and innovation as the prudent course of action.", "We were pleased to continue repurchasing our shares through our long-standing program, an indication of our enduring confidence in our business. We bought 1.3 million shares for a total return of capital of $104 million in the quarter. At March 31, 2017, we had $532 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. With leverage below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity to make strategically relevant acquisitions as well as additional repurchases.", "During the quarter, we spent $76 million on acquisitions, bringing trailing four-quarter total acquisition spend to $150 million. Since last quarter's earnings call, we closed the acquisition of Fintellix, further extending Argus' international end markets and enhancing our capabilities and global bank regulatory compliance.", "The acquisition of Fintellix positions Argus to expand our data hosting and regulatory platforms and better address the increasingly complex needs of our clients. We will continue to focus on M&A that helps drive our strategy and embodies the Verisk distinctives.", "At Investor Day in December, we began telling you about 20 internal investment opportunities we are funding to drive valuable solutions for our customers and growth for our company. These are promising new solutions, some of which have the potential to contribute significantly over a five-year time horizon.", "These major initiatives have their own project champions, at least one anchor customer and dedicated teams. They involve machine learning, telematics, the Internet of Things, high-resolution imagery, predictive fraud modeling, claims automation, digital marketing and alternative energy analytics.", "While the revenues in most cases will be slower to ramp up, the investments are already underway. We have identified these opportunities, which cross all our key vertical end markets as likely to generate attractive returns over the five-year planning horizon. We intend to move with speed and focus on these compelling innovation opportunities.", "We're running our game plan of innovation driving organic revenue, which will result in the delivery of free cash flow growth. Our businesses are strongly aligned with the Verisk distinctives of: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. With these come network effects, scale economies and a large percentage of subscription revenue.", "From this enduring foundation of strength, we are highly confident in the ability of our people to execute our strategy and plans, which ultimately relate to serving and adding value for our customers. You should expect our results to ramp as we move through this year and we are even more encouraged as we look to 2018 and beyond.", "So with that, I'm going to turn the call over now to Mark for some additional comments.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses, we serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have several key themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. While the headline growth across our insurance businesses is a bit below trend during the quarter, both the underlying performance and outlook for the rest of the year and beyond is encouraging.", "First, growth in the quarter was reduced by last year's true up revenue, which did not recur in 2017. Second and most important, the pricing environment and the competitive landscape remain consistent with the past. Third, as we look at the core solutions in each of our businesses, they're growing well.", "For example, in our catastrophe modeling business, the dynamics in the reinsurance industry continue to be challenging. That has affected the cap on and consulting businesses. However, as we look at the majority of what we do there, extreme event modeling, we are growing in the high single digits as we continue to take market share. Big data message, integrated into our platform, are very compelling to the industry.", "Looking at our claims businesses, our two largest solutions related to repair cost estimate continue to grow in the mid to high single-digits. This is a good example of continuing industry automation. And of course, fraud is evergreen, helping our anti-fraud related solutions continue to grow nicely.", "As a final example, in our personal lines underwriting business, where our solutions are well-established, but still newer to the market than some of our competitors, we're making good progress in innovating and gaining market share. We're applying big data methods, which we expect will be a key differentiator even as we help our customers digitally engage more effectively with their customers.", "Finally, in our important heritage ISO business, our normal course price increases went into effect in January and we're pleased with the uptake of our newer solutions. While many of you may think of the ISO solutions business as a steady, stable grower, which it is, we're really excited with the addition of new people who are helping us push forward with innovative solutions.", "These are allowing us to address parts of the end market where we haven't historically served, but where we see a lot of opportunity to help our customers solve tough problems they face. As we look at some of the newer things we're doing, including expanding into international markets and with the recent acquisition, there's a lot which is very encouraging.", "With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Mark. In the first quarter, we grew revenue and EBITDA on a comparable basis to the prior year, while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Our growth in the quarter was below trend as several headwinds affected us at the same time, consistent with our comments on our fourth quarter call and in presentations earlier this year.", "Currency hurt revenue results in the quarter by about $7.5 million. As we move through the year, we're confident that revenues will improve. Revenue in the quarter grew 2%. Organic constant currency revenue grew 2.5% and 3.4%, excluding the prior year true up revenue.", "We have included a new table in the press release to help you see the acquisition and FX results for each of our revenue lines more clearly. As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. Total acquired revenue in the quarter was $5.3 million.", "Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 0.1%. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 1.5%. This quarter, insurance was the fastest growing vertical and also the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Underlying the results are the continued resilience in our insurance business and some timing in our financial services revenue growth.", "Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 4.1% in the quarter. Last year, had around $4 million of one-time true-up revenue. And adjusting for this, organic constant currency revenue growth was 6.5%. Growth was led by strong performance in underwriting solutions, claims analytics, loss qualification, and catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter.", "We've spoken about reinsurance having an impact in some areas in terms of growth, but we are pleased that those trends aren't worsening and that the underlying growth in our subscription solutions and cap modeling remains very good, as Mark mentioned.", "Customer retention remains very high and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. Energy and specialized markets category revenue declined 5.9% in the quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue declined 2.1%. While continued energy end market headwinds and the British pound impacted revenue in the quarter, as expected, both of those trends have started to improve.", "The benefits will be over time, given the multi-year subscription nature of the majority of that business. The WoodMac team continues to do a great job managing the business to outstanding relative performance. The category revenue growth was reduced also by a decline in environmental health and safety solutions due to lower demand following the late 2015 completion of GHS standard-related implementation.", "Financial services revenue declined 0.5% in the quarter. The recent acquisition of Fintellix closed on March 31 and is contributing to revenue in the second quarter. Strong growth in media effectiveness and good growth in core banking solutions were offset by a couple of long-term government customers and a non-core customer who concluded their contracts in the fourth quarter. Those combined contracts contributed about $11 million for the full year 2016.", "Additionally, we typically see a seasonal step-down after Q4, which did occur this year as well. We remain optimistic about delivering growth in 2017 and building on what is a great dataset and analytic capability.", "Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 4.2%. The stable growth demonstrates the value to our longstanding insurance customers as well as contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the recent acquisitions.", "Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.9%, reflecting our 2017 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as predictive models and Electronic Rating Content. While still early, we're encouraged by the strong efforts to drive new product development in this part of the business.", "Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.5% in the quarter. Growth was led by subscription revenues. We have some components of this line that are purchased transactionally, which is where we are seeing more variation.", "EBITDA decreased 1.1% in the quarter to $246 million. The reported decline was a result of timing of revenue related to operating expenses, legal and acquisition costs, and the prior year true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance that occurred in the quarter. The combined cost of revenue and SG&A increased 5.9% or $15 million in the quarter. The increase was just 3.3% on an organic basis as we continue to manage expenses.", "EBITDA margins as reported were 48.9%. Margins were reduced by about 80 basis points due to acquisitions and about 60 basis points due to legal and transaction fees in the quarter. Total acquired revenue \u2013 sorry \u2013 total acquired EBITDA in the quarter was break-even. Acquisitions we're doing are close to the core with well-defined paths to top-line growth and margin expansion.", "Margins were also impacted in the quarter by our decision to grow expenses to support a multi-year view of revenue expectations as well as investment opportunities we've been discussing with you. Margins by segment were affected by rebalancing of our technology resources to reflect internal priorities as our Decision Analytics businesses expand the data sources they own and that serve as the foundation for their solutions. Our data storage needs are growing.", "Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at March 31, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was 2.2 times, below our 2.5 times reference level. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.5%. Adjusted net income in Q1 decreased 1.6% to $125 million. The average diluted share count was 170.2 million in the quarter and we bought about 1.3 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $81.24.", "Our repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. On March 31, 2017, our diluted share count was 169.4 million shares.", "Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.74 in the quarter, a decrease of 1.3%. Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased because the quarter's unusually modest revenue growth was more than offset by a higher tax rate and currency effects.", "Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $318 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 12.8%. Capital expenditures increased 22.9% to $31 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.", "CapEx was 6.2% of revenue year-to-date. Free cash flow increased 11.8% to $287 million for the three-month period ended March 31. Free cash flow was 116.7% of EBITDA as we continue to collect more cash in our seasonally strong Q1.", "Growth in free cash flow was driven by strong working capital management, highlighting an important aspect of our business model. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value.", "As you think about your models for 2017, currency will continue to be a headwind in 2Q, moderating a bit as we move into the second half based on current exchange rates. To help you look at the FX impact, the following 2016 total revenues are restated at the March 31, 2017 rate. If rates were unchanged from March 31, 2017, these would be the base for the organic constant-currency revenue growth for the remainder of the year. Most of the FX impact falls within the energy and specialized revenue line items in Decision Analytics.", "For 2Q 2016, the revenue would have been $490 million versus the reported $498 million. For Q3 2016, it would have been $494 million versus the reported $498 million, and for Q4 2016, the revenue would have been $505 million versus the reported $506 million.", "You'll also recall that merit increases go into effect April 1, which typically creates a seasonal step-up in the expense base. So there's a natural step-down in margins from Q1 to Q2, all else being equal.", "The net of many of these factors is that we continue to expect growth to improve as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. In addition, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization of $130 million to $135 million, up from what we expected last quarter as we were able to move projects into service faster than we had planned and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million.", "Based on our current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to be around $113 million. This includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. And in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% for the tax effect on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect the diluted weighted average share count of about 171.2 million shares.", "We look forward to ramping results through 2017 and beyond. We're excited about the opportunities to invest as we work to drive long-term free cash flow. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long-term. We also continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow up.", "And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks. First I guess, just want to follow-up on Scott's comment that, I think you said for the full year you expect insurance and financial services to grow consistent with history. But I think you also \u2013 given the loss of those contracts, can you help us understand \u2013 I guess more specifically, what you mean by consistent with history? And I guess, can you see Argus get back to the growth rates? I mean, that implies a pretty significant growth rate, so any more color, I guess, on the recovery from here?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Right. Well, one of the things to know about Argus is that it is sort of, I would say, a constantly dynamic environment in the sense that we are able to and are reaching out to new customers consistently. And so the right way to think about the business is that the customer list grows.", "There were these rotations of the government customers that we noted for you. But it is a dynamic set of customers, as well as a dynamic set of offerings where the media effectiveness solutions are really finding their mark. And so it will be a combination of new names on the customer list and increased levels of spending with customers that are already on the customer list.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And I guess mathematically, I think in the past, insurance and financial services have combined to grow kind of 7% to 8% the last few years. Is that the number that you're thinking of?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, that's exactly what we're saying.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "And is that an organic or including some of the acquisitions?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Organic.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "On financial services, it seems like growth or revenues maybe more dependent on large projects than I previously appreciated. So just \u2013 how much \u2013 how many large projects or what's the exposure to large projects do you still have in the revenue base there? And I heard that some slipped out of Q1, but just what's the visibility into the pipeline? And then I guess more importantly, how do you think about the long-term growth rate for Argus?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. So let me start with sort of the second question first, Jeff. We remain very positive about Argus' intermediate and long-term growth. The strength of where we start from, which is a very unique insight into patterns of consumer spending, we are continuing to find very good ways to commercialize that. And we're also finding ways to take the platform and expand it overseas.", "And so those trends are going to continue, basically. And so we feel very good about the growth profile. There is \u2013 as companies become \u2013 I mean, our customers become more aware of and aligned to the opportunity that they have to make use of these newer kinds of data analytics that they haven't made use of before, there are moment in time effects where they kind of get into the new methods and so, you do tend to get a bit more lumpiness when that happens. It's really just the nature of the beast. And the rotations out by, for example, the government customers, I think are very, very specific to their situations and their conditions and really don't reflect the overall commercial potential of what's here. But there is that effect even inside of what end up looking like subscription revenues because there is sort of a moment in time at which customers get into the new methods and that will sort of create a lump of revenue at a moment in time.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then in terms of the moderating industry headwinds that you called out, I heard Eva's comment about reinsurance, I guess stabilizing, but could you just broadly characterize your view of the insurance end market right now? So I guess reinsurance stabilizing, but what are your thoughts on other areas of the insurance ecosystem headwinds getting better, worse, stable, et cetera?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Sure. This is Mark. Good question. So let me start with the reinsurance side of things. So clearly, it's a very soft market from a reinsurance perspective, which puts pressure on our customers. That remains. At the same time, what we have highlighted is there's a lot of industry consolidations. When industry consolidations happen that also commonly interacts with our contracts with what is now one as opposed to two entities. That headwind has kind of almost cycled through.", "So that's good news with regard to cycling through. We've addressed kind of those concerns and how we want to contract with customers going forward and what we're also seeing is some volumes back into what I'll refer to as the securitization market. We see customers kind of ramping up to continue to do business as they always have. And as they look to expand and as they look to basically grow their businesses, both on the insurance side as well as the reinsurance side. They're looking at new avenues, whether it's cyber as an example. How are they going to move their books to new, what I'll refer to, is casualty-type of extreme events.", "So that's a good, constructive approach for the industry and we're kind of on the cutting edge with a lot of that. So that's a positive. I would say to you that I don't see a lot of dramatic change inside the insurance industry, except for the ones I've highlighted in the past. There is a tremendous amount of technology \u2013 InsureTech that is happening. People are installing new systems. They're transitioning over. They're really looking to do the big data analytics thing. They're really looking to do digital engagement because people expect kind of better online engagement, like they would with an Amazon or when they're buying product on the web. All of that has created a nice opportunity for us to get involved in those \u2013 kind of those projects to redefine how they want to see the future. So, tough time, but good opportunities for us in light of the changes happening. So...", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thank you, both.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "My first question is, I guess in the past, you've given your expectations for insurance in that same 7% to 8% camp. And then financial or Argus in the mid-teens. And now, you're sort of grouping them together and giving that guidance and from the comments, it sounded like you already reiterated your confidence in Argus. And so is the missing piece here then the natural insurance slowdown until all your investable opportunities, whatever, start coming to fruition? Is that how we should think of it?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "No. Manav, it's Eva. Maybe I'll just take it up a level just \u2013 as \u2013 I know, we always try to have discussions at very detailed levels. But fundamentally, I think what we're trying to tie our confidence to in the statements that Scott made around insurance and financial combined and the growth targets we have there is, we've made comments in the past about our overall long-term growth targets organically for Verisk Analytics. And the statement that Scott made ties very closely to that.", "Obviously, at the current moment in time, energy's at a moment where it's not at those levels. I think we've talked about that. I think the team is doing a great job. So really, how we've dimensioned it, I would think about it that way because we're \u2013 as Wood Mackenzie works through the energy cycle and is doing a great job, putting in that overall bucket at the moment in time would not be appropriate. So that's really what we're trying to message when we're talking about those two on a combined basis.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, got it. And then Scott, of those 20 opportunities, you mentioned a bunch of the different, I guess, bigger headlights and what \u2013 the stuff you're working on there. I mean, I think we've heard of telematics and imagery before, but is there any hierarchy or any sort of opportunity that stands out more than the others? Because some of the stuff like you mentioned like machine learning and Internet of Things seem fairly broad.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, the way that we're going to provide for our growth near and long-term actually is to operate on a number of fronts. And you've got some themes like Internet of Things broadly, like cyber as a theme, where the use cases, the path to commercialization is still sort of emerging. But that doesn't mean that the ideas are anything other than very good ideas and ones that we feel like we have special contributions to make.", "But in the sort of intermediate term, two themes that are \u2013 the ones that you've heard us talk about a lot, actually, and we really do have a lot of enthusiasm for are the interpretation of remote imagery, which we think is a very important theme for any number of reasons, including remote imagery and the interpretation of it can apply across multiple verticals and actually, multiple geographies.", "And the other one that I would point to is, in fact, telematics and especially vehicle telematics, where we just \u2013 we are \u2013 we can see, in our own experience, sort of the rising volumes of data and the increasing attention to those datasets and those analytics among our existing customer base. So, you've heard us talk about those two a lot. But that doesn't mean that they're tired in any sense. In fact, we think we're kind of in the early stages of both of those being important inside of our business.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on the energy business, could you remind us what percent of your contracts are sort of multiyear? And do you see energy getting worse here or is that just primarily currency?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, so on the first question, I would say, it's roughly half that are multiyear. And I think we've talked about in the past how we pick moments in time where we're responsive to customers and also market conditions where we choose to pull those out or shorten those. And what I would say is just with regards to WoodMac, we do continue, just in the reported results, to see some lag effect from the customer management in previous periods. But as we look at the business signing today, we're really seeing good growth in renewal signings, cross-sell, we have existing products. We have new solutions added from acquisitions over the past year or so. So we like how the year is shaping up so far.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. And then just a question on capital allocation, leverage is pretty low. It doesn't seem like there's any significant scale deals outside of the current verticals that you're in. Maybe if you could just frame for us your appetite to put on a dividend here, given your highly reoccurring revenue base, and with regard to that, the $100 million buyback. Is that a run rate we should expect going forward?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. So, let me start with that. Eva might want to add a little something to this. But I want to go back to kind of the premise of your question. We actually have always seen the M&A program as being sort of the complement to our program of internal investment. One of the values that we believe that we bring to our investors that is unique is that we have hundreds of people walking the halls of our customers on a daily basis. And being in such close contact with our customers, we're able to see the solutions that are making a difference for them. First and foremost, our own, of course.", "But, we're actually able to see other third parties and knowing where we think value lies and what our strategy is about and having this intelligence in terms of what else is going on in the market, we will always lean into the program of M&A. And in fact, if anything, we've really redoubled our efforts to enlist everybody to be a part of the M&A team.", "And so, we don't see it as a world, a situation where there isn't opportunity. In fact, we think that there is opportunity. So I just needed to start with that because the way that we think about capital, we certainly care deeply about deploying capital effectively. The program of M&A has been highly productive for our investors and we believe that it will continue to be. We're very comfortable returning capital and we've done so and we've done so steadily.", "Whatever is the right way to deploy capital is what we're going to do on behalf of our shareholders. To-date, it has not occurred to us that a dividend was necessarily a part of that mix. We ask the question routinely. We'll continue to ask the question. But so far, I think you've seen in our behavior that we're not only comfortable returning capital in the form of buybacks, but we have done so and I think you should continue to expect us to do so. So there will be a balance there. There always has been a balance there and there always will be a balance there.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "And maybe just to answer your specific question about run rate, I think just tying into how Scott described our capital allocation, our first filter that we look for is buying interesting companies that meet our distinctives that add to growth, that add to customer solution. And then after that filter is put in place, the next filter is our stock repurchase program and that's going to be keyed off, as it always has been, the value of the stock at the moment in time and we are managing that not to accretion/dilution, but rather actually to the returns like our investors would as well.", "So when you ask about run rate, we don't actually design our program as a run rate program. It's going to be a function of that initial filter around M&A and obviously, I think, as you know, M&A isn't sort of quarter-by-quarter, you chunk it in. And so that repurchase rate will vary across the year depending upon what that filter and what that pipeline looks like.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Morning.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks for taking the question. As I think about Verisk and my experience with the company, I would describe the business, insurance business generally, as being relatively unexposed or underexposed, I guess, to insurance end market fundamentals. I wonder if you can comment, sort of qualitatively on whether or not you think (35:59) changed and accordingly would it \u2013 does it influence the type of products you're developing, the time to market, our expectations for return on the investments you've been making and so forth. So I appreciate the comment on the reacceleration of revenue growth. I just wonder if there's something that's sort of fundamentally changed in the relationship between Verisk's insurance business and the end markets it serves.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. No, we really don't think that and as you would imagine, we actually are very alert to that and would be quite sensitive if we thought there was something there. But, no, actually, I mean, if you look at industry structure, there \u2013 I mean there's like one larger merger that is sort of in the process of ratcheting through.", "And as we've discussed many times on these calls and in other forums, when something like that occurs, where those two companies are concerned, there may be a moment in time, adjustment. But, yes, I mean that's kind of normal course business from our perspective. And the regulatory environment really is not changing. It's not particularly dynamic. And so kind of from that perspective, the environment in which we do our business is more or less the same.", "When I talk to the chief executives of other insurance companies, as I do routinely, what they are really about is changing their methods and trying to find ways to grow their businesses. That's fundamentally what they're giving attention to. And we stand in that stream of activity for them.", "Do they have healthy amounts of self-respect and want to make sure that they're getting ultimate value from a partner like us and do they like to talk to us about the invoices that we send them, et cetera? Sure. And they always have. But I don't really think \u2013 if you go back 15 years, you could find moments when premiums went up pretty substantially year-over-year. That has not recurred for quite some time now.", "So our mission is the same as it's always been, which is to do a fantastic job of relating to our customers and bringing them new sources of value. I think they're as open to that as they've ever been. I think that we are more innovative than we've ever been. And that's really what's going to determine the outcome as we go forward. I will say, we definitely need to keep our feet moving. Their issues modify and change and we need to be right there as they do. So it's not a question of staying where we are. We have to be extremely energetic. But I don't think anything has changed in terms of our standing with them.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And if I play devil's advocate and say, okay, Verisk has been investing in a lot of these new solutions, which I think you enumerated, Scott, for a while, and you just had a tough quarter with some external pressure. Why is it now that all of a sudden, at least it feels that way from the outside looking in, some of these new solutions gain traction? Are there specific contracts or customers to which you can point that create sort of a coincidental inflection point in the growth from some of these new offerings?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, that is why we have the view that we have of the rest of 2017 and beyond. As we know specifically what is going on in the business, specific customers, specific contracts and so, yes, I mean that's \u2013 whenever we're reporting to you, whenever we make a forward-looking statement, it's on that basis. That's how we think about our business.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I'll give a little color, if it's helpful. One of the things that we try to always do is take a look at what's committed from the standpoint of contracts, what's implementing, when and I think what we've seen is two things. About 2/3 of our kind of need for revenue growth is committed in the form of kind of contracted price escalation, contracted new products, contracted new customers and what remains is kind of a new sale type of target that is reasonable in light of what we've done in the past and reasonable in light of what we have in our pipeline. So we continue to feel good about the full year.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Good morning.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So, I just wanted to get delve a little bit more into Mark's good feelings about the rest of the year. So if we ended up at about, let's see look, so (41:01) 2.5% organic growth in Q1, you adjust for the true up, it will probably be about 3.3%. So, I wanted to ask about the pace of acceleration towards that 7% to 8% target and the 7% to 8% target being the level at which all businesses are firing on all cylinders. And are we thinking you could get there at the end of 2017? Or maybe we're thinking more of the end of 2018? I'm just trying to get a sense for the pace of the acceleration.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. Just to reiterate, that was a 2017 comment. So just to say it again, the rate of organic growth for our combined insurance and financial services businesses we think will be on a historic trend, in that 7% to 8% range for the full year.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "And as it relates to insurance, I'll reiterate to the extent that we think of the incremental growth that we need, about 2/3 of it, we believe, are committed in the form of contract with 1/3 or so of this incremental being, let's go, get it and that's new sales.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "And just to wrap on, I think you're asking a question about ramp, I think you know the nature of our business where we have a large portion of subscription contracts which is a real positive for us, but that also means is a subscription starts July 1, that starts contributing then. So naturally, as you layer in subscriptions, that layers into the growth across the rest of the year.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask about the international expansion opportunity. You've talked in the past about an opportunity in banking, also an opportunity in insurance. I want to know if we could get an update on that and also maybe talk a little bit about how cloud receptivity by the client base is playing into that.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. So first of all, with respect to international, there are some \u2013 we're presenting differently internationally than we used to. WoodMac has always been international. But I'm \u2013 and actually, Argus has always had a strong dimension of that. But the \u2013 I just want to underline the Fintellix acquisition and the additional reach that that provides to the Argus franchise, which is a really good news.", "Over on the insurance side, we are presenting credentials and presenting solutions at a level and to a set of customers that we kind of haven't before, basically. I mean we were aware of them. They were aware of us, but we are now in a position to be able to make large proposals to name brand companies.", "We've always been able to do that in the reinsurance vertical. But now in the insurance vertical, we are increasingly positioned to be able to do that. It's really very exciting, actually. Nothing is going to occur overnight in vertical data analytic lands the way that we do things. But we are quite encouraged actually by what's going on there.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Scott, I was hoping if it's okay to look back to 2016. Looking back to early 2016, Verisk thought the insurance vertical, in total, would accelerate for full year 2016 and then later, contract starts seemed to slip and the insurance vertical didn't accelerate for full year 2016 and so what I want to know is the contract wins that you got from last year that you thought would ramp and then didn't ramp, are they ramping now?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. It's all a part of the overall view that we gave you. I mean, we've got thousands of customers. And it's depending upon which part of our company we're talking about.", "But so the effect, the overall effect in our business is the accumulation of a lot of different things that are going on. But fundamentally, the relationships with the existing customers are as strong as ever.", "We are pushing out internationally, which isn't yet an overwhelming effect but it's positive, it's constructive, and new solutions continue to find their way. And it's really at the intersection of all those things that our results occur.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.", "Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning. This is Patrick in for Toni. I wanted to go back to the stream of new products. How should we think about the relative commercial impact of the new products you're currently developing or rolling out across the insurance business, as compared to the classic products you developed and rolled out over the last three years? I'm wondering if there are just fewer home runs left to hit in that market.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "No. I don't feel that way at all. In fact, I think some of the newer solutions have probably above average potential. And it may \u2013 those of you who have sort of been with us for a while, if we keep saying the same things like remote imagery analytics and Telematics that may sound like there's nothing new there.", "In data analytic land, particularly in vertical market data analytic land, it takes a while to get to the inflection point. And then you get to the inflection point. And so, that's effectively the dynamic that work inside of our business. So, don't misunderstand us going back to the same themes and as you try to interpret our growth in any particular time period, you may be trying to sort of create sort of a 1:1 equivalence.", "Solutions, when they finally find their mark, actually have an unusual inflection relative to where they began. And so, as you would imagine, day-to-day, minute-to-minute, we're working on this absolutely as hard as we can to get established as well as feeding the pipeline with additional new solutions. I don't \u2013 it's not the case that the newer solutions have lesser potential than those that maybe we developed three to five years ago. I don't know if you want to add to that, Mark.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Only thing I was going to highlight, too, is I think we have a preference. I'd assume our colleague from the phone do that. We would prefer a subscription-type model. So as opposed to kind of going at it from a transactional perspective, we'd like to create longer-term contracts with customers and the revenue rec on that flow (47:57). So that is a way we feel that they'll use us for all of their transactions as opposed to selected ones, if you were to try to price it on a transaction. So maybe a little bit of a patient philosophy, but that's the way we typically worked up the side of the (48:14) solutions into our revenue mix.", "Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. And in the Investor Day in December, you talked about a $2 billion TAM for Argus. I'm wondering if there are opportunities for you to go after that market in a bigger way with incremental investments in sales and new product development or perhaps more transformative M&A.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Sort of reverse order on your question. The acquisition of Fintellix for example, we really do believe it puts us on a different foot in global markets. And there are other solutions other \u2013 I would call them kind of point solutions, data analytic point solutions that relate strongly to things that we already today that we are interested in thinking about. And that would be a combination of buy and build.", "But otherwise, the way that the Argus business advances is basically, we present credentials to companies that aren't customers. They find out the speed with which they can begin to commercialize the insight that we bring them from a data analytic perspective.", "So in a sense, I agree with the tone of your question in that the more that we can do to present credentials to an ever-expanding set of customers, the more of that we can do the better. That said, I think we've got a great team and I think we're doing a good job with that. But we're always leaning into how can we take this wonderful platform and leverage it?", "Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Appreciate the color.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the margin outlook. Have you adjusted the cost based on the slow start? And how much of the margin outlook is dependent on the growth this year?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. Well, thanks for the question. I think as I've mentioned, as we're talking through the quarter, we were modest in the growth in the quarter. Expenses grew about 3.3%. We are within that investing in the new solutions and also making sure that we've got the capacity as revenue ramps.", "So, I guess the way I would think about it is, we don't manage those expenses quarter-by-quarter because we are managing for the long-term growth. Certainly, as \u2013 if you see revenue ramp, that's helpful to margins as we go through the year. But what we want to make sure that we're not doing is that we're not being reactive to unusual, short-term events and disadvantaging ourselves for the long-term.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And then on the energy front, how much of the rebound is dependent on oil prices and CapEx versus selling the new solutions?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "It's a mix of both. But when we talk about pricing and we talk about the energy business, it's not the case that there's this one to one correspondence between what the price of the commodity does and our growth opportunity.", "It is true that there has been \u2013 the shape of the price curve over the course of the last couple of years is one that hasn't been seen for several decades. It's a very unusual moment. Actually, if you think about it, the WoodMac business, there were two once in a generation things that have happened in the course of the last two years.", "One is that, the shape of the price curve is extremely unusual. And the other is Britain exited the EU, and the effect that it's had on their currency. Those are two real big effects, both of which are relatively difficult to foresee.", "In spite of all that, actually, I think the strength of WoodMac is seen more than it has ever been. But back to your specific point, I think that what you need is \u2013 what we need is essentially where we're getting to, which is a stable environment, one where our resource company customers are making money and leaning into investments on the front foot, basically.", "And they got, understandably, very defensive beginning late in 2014 when several of them had to borrow money to pay their dividends. So, these very, very major macro effects. But as they wash out, one of the things about Verisk is we're in the business of growing faster than the underlying markets \u2013 vertical markets that we serve. And we've essentially always done that. We've been doing that, 2016, 2017 we will \u2013 I mean that's who we are, that's what we do.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Arash Soleimani of KBW.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. A couple questions. So first, I just wanted to ask, within energy and specialized, how much of the decline came from WoodMac versus environmental health and safety? And then just continuing on that question, how much of that was subscription versus transactional?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. So if you were to look in the segment, you're right. Those are the two key pieces within there. Obviously, WoodMac is a larger business than our environmental health and safety business. Although I would say that in the quarter, its performance was better than that smaller business. So there's sort of a balance between the two.", "As I said earlier, we still have some lag effects from previous periods in WoodMac. I mean, that's the nature of subscription businesses. And so that did contribute to a bit of the decline in the quarter. Also remember, you've got \u2013 we've got a lot of numbers in front of you. Now you've got three different growth rates per line, so if you're looking at the absolute reported, the currency effect from WoodMac would be the largest impact. And I think I talked about that $7.5 million in the quarter.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. And then I have a question that's probably very, very, very long-term in nature. But just as we look at technology that's making cars safer and that ultimately will even make cars drive themselves, which will increase safety even more, that could have a very negative impact on auto premiums longer term. I'm just curious how that impacts Verisk.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. Let me take that on. I mean clearly, that's on the minds of our personal lines of writers. The insurance industry as a whole, I think has a view that that's going to make for a safer long-term environment for people on the road. It can save a million or more lives per year. And I think there's some views out there, you can kind of do your own research that, now, the personal auto premium could be something that looks at maybe half of what it is today.", "I think those customers are looking to ways to kind of reimagine their business and I think a lot of it has to do with moving into what I'll call small commercial lines, so micro business owners work on the cyber side of things. That very much fits our model. That's very helpful. They want to try to move into what is kind of a personal lines flow, meaning just, do it in an expert way without people involved, and they want to move that concept, which is on the personal lines side, to commercial.", "So those fit well into what we're trying to help them do that. The other thing I think we should just remember as a whole, a large part of the risk throughout the world is either uninsured or underinsured. And I think that's the biggest opportunity for the industry as a whole. There's a need there and I think the industry needs to find ways to ensure what is a very, very large market opportunity with better analytics and ways to assess that risk. So longer-term, bigger picture, but (56:17).", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I would just add that one of the things that will always be the case is, almost regardless of the size of the segment, the participants will still need to understand where they stand relative to the overall marketplace and part of what we do is we really help get a handle on what's affecting that whole space and also the relativity \u2013 excuse me, the relativities between the players. That will be an enduring need. So it's not just the scale of the market. It's also the need to pick apart what's going on in the market.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you very much for the answers.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Sure.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hey, guys, morning. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Morning.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Hi, Henry.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to make sure I understand in terms of the trends in insurance and the Decision Analytics side. I understand there's a number of moving parts in terms of the revenue growth. Just from an earnings growth perspective, is that tracking sort of in line with the organic growth post \u2013 or excluding the true-up revenue. And as a follow-up to that, in terms of the ramp-up that you expect from the new products in insurance, is that also a ramp up that you expect in earnings as well? Thanks.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. So, there are a couple questions in there. So maybe just to start with, I think your first question is when you say profitability, I presume you're speaking on an EBITDA level. And what I would say is \u2013 I mean, what you see across the company is, we're managing expense growth to both fund the existing solutions as well as new ones and I would say that's the same within insurance. So I don't think you'd see dramatically different trends if you were to sort of parse apart the profitability by vertical because we are investing across all of the verticals. I would also note that in the acquisition front, there are a number of new acquisitions. In the quarter, those were essentially across all the acquisitions breakeven. Those are things that we're clicking into our existing business and we think that those margins will ramp. So you have those two effects within the margin.", "And then I think your second question was with regards to new products and the profitability of those as those sort of click in. Generally, similar to the rest of our solutions, the whole idea of build it once, sell it a lot of times. The more you put on the top-line, the greater the profitability expands. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything additional about any of the specific solutions we're working on there.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So I think we were trying to address this a little bit before. I think we are seeing uptake in some of the remote imagery. I think we're seeing some uptake in our customers with telematics. I think we have good growth and opportunities internationally the way we contracted around that will be probably more subscription that it is on the transactional perspective. So as that uptake is more of a second-half story, we would also see that as hopefully helping margins because what happens here is we've already invested in or investing in a solution. So it's just the overall dynamic of the nature of our business. Yes, there is a lot of costs that are there and they'll remain because we're investing and once we start the uptake in revenues, there's not a lot of variable incremental cost sales.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Anj Singh of Credit Suisse.", "Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you folks spoke to some of the contract signings slipping out of 1Q for your energy customers. Is that just timing randomness perhaps, or is this indicative of the end market that continues to stabilize? Just wondering if there's anything particular we should be taking away from that anecdote.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, the comment was about the financial services segment, not the energy segment. And no, there is \u2013 it really was just timing.", "Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay, got you. And then another question on the 20 opportunities, Scott, asked slightly differently. Realizing these are longer-term opportunities, would it be fair to say that the internal augmentation or development focus is also primarily on remote imagery and telematics? Perhaps, if you can offer any color on which ones you've made the most progress recently aside from their good market traction. Thanks.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, it really is remote imagery and telematics. Those are the places where they both represent very large opportunities and places where we're seeing commercial response to what it is we're doing. So we've talked about those a lot. We continue \u2013 we will continue for years to talk about those a lot because they're just that important. But there are a lot of things on the list of 20 that are very exciting across all the segments. And some of them are domestically-based. Some of them are globally-based.", "They all really rely on advanced data analytic methods and in many cases, are being founded on new kinds of contributory data, unique data that will help us to do things we think others won't be able to. So it's an exciting agenda basically. You get to a list like that by being close to your customers and understanding where their needs are going.", "Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Eva, kind of housekeeping one. Could \u2013 you were going kind of quick there when you were giving the adjusted Q2, Q3, Q4 2016 revenues. I was wondering if you could repeat that. (62:32) the $490 million, $505 million.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. Sorry if I was going too quick on that. So, just to repeat, if we look to 2Q 2016 and restated it to today's currency rates, that would have been $490 million. The reported number was $498 million. For Q3 2016, it would have been $494 million. The reported number was $498 million. And for Q4 2016, it would have been $505 million, and the reported number was $506 million.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. And can I just \u2013 did that also exclude the true-up \u2013 the true-up was in the Q1 of 2016, correct?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Correct.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. All right. That was my...", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "And that was just the reported number total translated at the currency rate.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yeah. That's really helpful.

This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary. I'll be quick. I guess, just the timing of the Argus contract, I guess, for the deals, have those been signed already in the quarter? And I guess, are those new contracts with existing customers or were they \u2013 some of those tied to some of the contracts that were completed in Q1?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. Those are existing customers. And as we do multiple things for our customers, there is a layering of that. But I think, as Scott said, it's a timing issue and we feel comfortable and confident with that work moving forward.", "Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess, with the energy and Wood Mackenzie, obviously, there is still some lag from some of your customers and the multi-year deals rolling over. I guess, can you kind of give us some more color on whether you're seeing greater demand or usage in various regions or some of the pricing terms? Are you guys looking to lock in into more longer-term deals? Or maybe just give us some more commentary on some of the improving trends you mentioned. Thanks.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, a couple of different things in there. One is the customer set continues to expand, as we've shared with you. The solution set continues to expand also where we're \u2013 you've sort of known us as the people that can describe the global supply curve, which is extremely valuable and very hard to do and a very, very nice sort of starting place \u2013 a strong place to stand. What we will get increasingly good at is and more of our business will be about is the underlying technical conditions and helping our customers sort of navigate those as well.", "With respect to pricing trends, we're always just \u2013 the WoodMac product set as all of our product sets, we're always stuffing more value in there. And that's one of the things that is productive where pricing is concerned. So you've got that effect. So, basically, new solutions, new customers and improving environment where pricing is concerned. That's basically going to be the WoodMac story going forward.", "The currency effects will wash out. And I do think that we'll see where this is the kind of thinking we're doing, but it may be that as the environment is improving, we may actually want to be a little lighter on our feet and actually sort of pull in the length of the contract so that we can \u2013 as things move, we can actually enjoy it more in real time.", "Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Makes sense. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. My first question on the energy revenue, I know we've asked a number on this already but as you mentioned that there were some contracts signed the depths (66:20) of the market and there's a lag nature to them. I guess, I wanted to specifically ask, are we therefore at the end of the worst of these lag contracts and you should actually see revenue growth improve? Or is that something will be playing through for the rest of the year and therefore, growth really shouldn't pick up until closer to 2018?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "We would expect improvement as the year progresses.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And I guess, one housekeeping question. Just on the M&A contribution from Fintellix, if you are sharing that as we build our models?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. Typically, for the smaller deals, we don't share that in advance. It will come in April 1. So you'll see the numbers as we report in 2Q.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.", "Eva F. Huston", "Thank you, Shirley. And good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "All numbers we discuss today, unless stated otherwise, will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx, our mortgage services business which we sold in March. Interthinx is classified as discontinued operations in this quarter and previous periods. In our 10-Q filing, revenue is reported from continuing operations only, but EBITDA is shown including Interthinx and the related gain on sale, per the SEC requirement. In our press release, we report EBITDA from continuing operations to assist you in your analysis. As you will recall, last quarter, we included in the back of our press release a reconciliation of continuing operations to the total, as well as the quarterly detail for 2012 and 2013 excluding Interthinx.", "The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.", "A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until May 29, 2014, on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you, Eva. And good morning, everybody.", "Our first quarter revenue growth was good, driven by very strong performance in our insurance units. Our innovation and analytic agenda is active in all of our verticals, and I'm very confident it will lead to new solutions for our customers and that these investments will deliver good returns over time. You can see some impacts of these investments in our margins this quarter, although our margins continue to place Verisk in an elite group of companies.", "We consider our organic growth rate to be the single best measure of our vitality as an organization. Over the course of the last couple of years, we have improved our mix of assets and supported continued organic growth. In particular, we divested our mortgage services assets and acquired Argus, shifting our focus from the challenged mortgage market to the expanding global payments market. In addition, we have added health care assets that align with the fundamental trend toward improved efficiency in health care spend in both the government and private markets.", "We remain focused on making sure our health care business delivers excellence. In February, we successfully concluded the Medicare Advantage review season. Ensuring we deliver the results our customers expected in the form of reimbursement from Medicare came with a cost to Verisk, which you see in the margins for the quarter. We did the right thing for our customers in the fourth and first quarters and believe our relationships with them are stronger for the effort. We continue to make progress in demand planning with our health care customers and we are reassured by these positive customer interactions, and continue to expect mid-teens revenue growth for the full year of 2014.", "On the inorganic side, we remain excited about the opportunity to add EagleView Technologies, or EVT, to our existing solution sets. We are also active in evaluating additional opportunities to align with our strategic vision and focus on strong organic growth over time.", "We continue to run the business with a long-term focus while remaining aware of the need to execute everyday. The data and analytic mindset informs our strategic thinking, as well as our approach to solving the immediate challenges our customers face. Our approach to managing the business is well aligned with our innovation agenda, as innovation works in long cycles. We will continue to invest prudently in order to drive both top line and free cash flow growth over time. Our twin goals of organic growth through innovation and operating with efficiency remain key focal points for the entire Verisk management team.", "As you know, on January 14, we announced the signing of an agreement to acquire EVT, who are a leader in imagery analytics and they offer solutions in the property and casualty, contractor, government and commercial spaces. On March 28, we received a request for additional information from the FTC. We are responding to the second request and currently expect to close our acquisition during the third quarter of 2014.", "As we've stated, our strategy is to allocate capital to the highest-return opportunities for shareholders, and EVT is one of those opportunities. The business has grown strongly, leveraging the foundation of the government and municipality business into new markets in insurance and other commercial sectors. And we have significant opportunity to continue to grow the business both in the United States and, over time, internationally.", "We continue to evaluate additional M&A opportunities, as we remain focused on our core principle of creating shareholder value through innovation, discipline and execution. We have capacity for additional acquisitions that meet our strategic agenda. We also have continued to repurchase our stock, a sign of our confidence in the future and in our capital capacity.", "We talked to you last quarter about the number of ideas coming forward from our business units for creating new solutions and enhancing existing ones. These initiatives are moving forward and we continue to maintain strong margins while doing so. We also continue to spend to ensure that our current solutions remain excellent, including re-platforming initiatives in areas such as catastrophe modeling, repair cost estimating, P&C underwriting and health care. We still expect margins to be flattish for the year, with strength building in the second half, as is typical.", "In the first quarter of 2014, we delivered good overall performance, with total organic revenue growth of about 9% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 6%. EBITDA margin from continuing operations was about 45% in the quarter.", "We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. As I mentioned earlier, we remain active in looking at M&A. We continue to focus on assets with a strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth. In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $89 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was about $77 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy, as previously outlined.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Thanks, Scott.", "In the first quarter, total revenue grew 8.7%.", "For the first quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 10.4% revenue growth. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in financial services and insurance. Our Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 11.8% in the first quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in loss quantification and catastrophe modeling solutions. Underwriting growth in the quarter was good, and claims solutions also contributed. Overall revenue growth was driven by increased adoption of the existing and new solutions.", "In financial services, we were pleased to see growth of 21.6% in the quarter. The growth outlook at Argus remains positive, including through international expansion, additional penetration of existing customers and partnering opportunities, in particular related to advertising effectiveness with traditional and new media companies. We continue to expect financial services to grow at least mid-teens in 2014.", "In the health care vertical, revenue in the first quarter grew 8.2%, an acceleration versus last quarter led by growth in Medicare Advantage-related solutions. As you know, there's some seasonality in the business relates -- which relates to the second-half review season for Medicare Advantage plans. So looking at half years when comparing to the prior year is generally more relevant than comparisons on a per-quarter basis. As we discussed with you last quarter and at Investor Day, the 2013 Medicare Advantage season ran through February of 2014, so some of the challenges we faced in late 2013 continued into the first quarter and impacted margins. We continue to work with our customers to jointly improve demand planning and expect an improvement in 2014. We still expect the category to see mid-teens revenue growth in the full year 2014.", "In the specialized markets category, revenue declined 1% in the first quarter. Good growth in the quarter in environmental health and safety and commercial weather and climate analytics were more than offset by lower activity related to government sector customers.", "Turning to Risk Assessment. For the first quarter, we reported revenue growth of 6.4%, indicating the value to our longstanding insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew revenue 6.3% in the quarter. This reflects our 2014 invoices which were effective January 1.", "In addition, we saw a contribution to growth from newly adopted solutions such as predictive modeling, electronic rating content and workers' comp solutions. We also had an above-average amount of transaction revenue in the quarter, which we would expect not to recur at the same level for the rest of the year.", "Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 6.5% in the quarter. This increase was in the form of new sales, including those resulting in higher committed volumes and contracts transitioning transactional revenue to higher, longer-term subscription-type commitments.", "EBITDA from continuing operations for the first quarter increased 3.5% to $182.8 million, and our EBITDA margin from continuing operations was 44.6%.", "There was some carryover spending in the first quarter related to Medicare Advantage busy season, which ran through mid-February. This is a continuation of the additional spending to deliver for our customers that we had discussed with you last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to work to execute on our demand-planning initiatives with our customers.", "The margins in Decision Analytics were 36.2% in the first quarter of 2014 versus 40.4% in the first quarter of 2013. The lower margin was primarily the result of increased costs in our health care business, as well as some investments to support our innovation agenda, partially offset by revenue growth in the segment. As Scott mentioned, costs in our health care segment allowed us to meet customer needs in the short term while building long-term relationship success as we work to scale our operations.", "In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 57.5% versus 56.4% in the first quarter of 2013. Our margins were advanced in the quarter by revenue growth, good expense management and lower pension costs.", "Our interest expense was down $2.7 million in the first quarter versus the respective period in 2013 due to lower debt balances as a result of repayments made in 2013. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate using our revolver and cash on hand, as well as proceeds from the sale of Interthinx, to fund the purchase of EVT.", "Reported effective tax rate was 35.7% for the quarter. The lower-than-expected tax rate was primarily due to a favorable state legislative change.", "Adjusted net income increased 3.6% to $93.3 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 5.8%. The average diluted share count was 170.4 million shares in the quarter. On March 31, 2014, our diluted share count was 169.8 million shares. In the quarter, we repurchased about 1.4 million shares for $88.7 million. At quarter end, we had about $76.5 million under our authorization left.", "Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of about 20%. For 2014, we continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution.", "Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $427.4 million as a result of our seasonally strong first quarter cash flow, as well as proceeds from the sale of our mortgage services business.", "Total debt, both short term and long term, was about $1.3 billion. Today, our incremental debt capacity is about $1 billion and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow.", "Our debt-to-pro forma EBITDA from continuing operations as of March 31 was 1.7x, below our steady-state target. With the acquisition of EVT and sale of Interthinx, we anticipate our leverage will rise to 2x at the close of the transaction.", "Free cash flow, adjusted for 2 items that I'll discuss in a moment, grew 6.8% compared with the prior period to $212.9 million. This represented over 100% of EBITDA from continuing operations in the first 3 months of 2014 due, in part, to the typical prepayment for some of our solutions. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. To facilitate comparability to the prior period, we adjusted free cash flow to the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013, and for the sale of our mortgage services business this year.", "Cash provided by operating activities, as reported, increased $41.6 million. This increase was the result of a $6.3 million increase generated by improved profitability of the business, a $2.7 million decrease in interest paid due to lower debt balances, a decrease of $33.7 million in taxes and $13.4 million from working capital and other balance sheet changes. This was partially offset by other outflows of about $14.5 million.", "Our capital expenditures were 8.6% of revenue year-to-date 2014. We continue to expect about $147 million in CapEx for the full year.", "A greater use of capitalized software related to new solutions will modestly raise the capital intensity of our business when compared to historic levels, although capital expenditures in 2014 are expected to be lower than 2013. We aim to grow free cash flow at or above the level of our EBITDA growth.", "As you think about your models for the full year 2014, we expect flattish margins for the full year, excluding Interthinx. You should expect to see that margin building in the second half of the year. As we remain focused on our innovation agenda, we are maintaining our longer-term view of margins in the 45% to 47% range. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be about $57 million, fixed asset amortization and depreciation of about $75 million to $80 million and an effective tax rate between 37.5% and 38%.", "We aim to keep share count flat through our share repurchase program. At our current level of debt, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Based upon the strength of our cash flow generation and the divestiture and the resulting cash balances, we anticipate borrowing $300 million or less for the acquisition of EVT, depending on timing of the close and other events. After the close of the EVT transaction, we will update you.", "Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We have a nice mix of growth across multiple verticals, and we continue to invest with discipline for the future to continue strong organic growth.", "I will turn the call back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.", "Eva F. Huston", "Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Suzi Stein from Morgan Stanley.", "Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Could you just help us understand how sustainable the acceleration of revenue growth in the insurance portion of Decision Analytics is? I mean how much of that is transaction versus subscription? And would you expect the level of growth, which had been quite a bit slower the last -- last 2 quarters, to stay at the double-digit rate that it's at this quarter?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Suzi, this is Mark. I think we feel pretty positive about the insurance segment. I'll call out a few things. First of all, there's pretty good stability inside the industry-standard programs. We did have a little bit of a transactional blip, not significant, but that would probably not recur in the second quarter and beyond. But to further your point, our repair cost estimating, loss quantification and the catastrophe models, those businesses are performing very nicely. We see good activity. And to kind of follow up on your question, these are subscription-type of businesses where people prepay for a year or more of service, so not a lot of transactional volume related to that. And that's about wins. That's about new products. It's reasonably strong across the board.", "Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you help us maybe with what you're doing with share repurchases? It looks like this year -- that at the pace you are going now, share repurchases will be finished, based on the authorization, maybe this quarter. But -- so does the EVT deal impact your view on how aggressive you'll be with that?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Not really. I mean, we have confidence -- this is Scott. We have confidence that we will complete the EVT transaction. And so we've already factored that into our thought process. And we continue to believe that the share repurchase program is a very reasonable use of capital. And we talked to you about what our authorizations are. We're always taking account of the facts on the ground, but no, I think we've -- we already know where we're at with respect to EVT. And we will continue to manage the share repurchase program with the same goal as we've always had, which is at least to limit dilution and opportunistically, to go beyond that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little more on the Medicare Advantage inside of health care? And you talked about demand planning. Can you get clients to do this earlier in the year? And I guess, what's been the holdback from them? I guess, just any more color on how you're going to change that process and, perhaps associated with that, automate any additional parts of the process to improve the efficiency.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Tim, it's Scott here. So to your basic question, yes. Actually, we do believe and we are engaged in exactly this, which is trying to be more -- for there to be more clarity and transparency in our relationship with our major customers on the Medicare Advantage side. And what helps us in that is that they actually have incentives to get to exactly the same place, because they have so much at stake in getting all of this right. They really want to know that they're important vendors. And I think that -- I know that we are an important vendor to an increasing number of players. They want to know that their important vendors are going to be there for delivery. And so as both Mark and I said earlier in our comments, one of the things that happened was we were really, really focused on making sure that delivery up to the moment that the process timed out on February 14 was really good so that our customers got the results that they wanted, and they did. And as a result of that, inside of these relationships, I think it's fair to say there is even more of a sense of confidence and mutual confidence. And I think that, that encourages the -- our customers to be more planful with us basically. It's good for all of us, them and us. So I think that we're in a situation where it makes sense, and our customers know that it makes sense.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And is this a -- you talked about margins still being flat for the year but building in the second half. I guess, is this the -- there's obviously a lot of factors, but how important is convincing clients to do this and to you actually achieving that and those better margins in the second half of the year? It would appear like this is one of the big swing factors to getting margins back.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, I think you may be tying together 2 things there a little too tightly, Tim. So first of all, yes, I mean we're focused on growing the business and working very hard at that. And obviously, there's a relationship between top line growth and the bottom line. But as it relates to sort of the ebb and flow of our margins, if you look at us through time, we've typically been a back-half kind of a company for quite a few reasons. Some of it relates to seasonality. Some of it relates to the fact that we take a little bit of a step up, usually in the second quarter, with respect to our people costs. And so there's actually a lot of factors in there. And I actually -- it sounded like what you were trying to do was sort of tightly link those 2 observations. I think that's a little too tight. There's a lot of things that go on that describe our margin profile.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So just on the health care side, real quickly, the additional costs this quarter in health care, was that more than what you had initially expected? I know you talked about it last quarter. I was just curious if that came in more than maybe what you had initially planned. And is basically the lack of that investment a big driver in terms of the second-half margin improvement?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I would not describe us as surprised by what happened. I mean there's a process that we're working through with our customers that plays out over a long period of time. And the fourth quarter of 2013 -- the fourth quarter of any year and the first quarter of the following year are both sort of peak moments inside of this [indiscernible]. We were executing in the fourth quarter and we knew where things were. And so no, I would not describe it as a surprise.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess, just on the margin front, like is that -- is basically the lack of an investment a big driver in terms of -- a big component at least in terms of the margin improvement you're expecting in the second half?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, same answer that I just gave Tim, which is there is the -- there is some seasonality inside of health care, and that is a contributing factor. But there are a -- I mean we in general have seen higher margins in the back half of the year for a whole variety of reasons.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Again, can you give any color on that request by the FTC on EVT? I know you said you responded, but anything else you can add there?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "No. We're at work.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I guess I want to ask the health care question a little bit differently, Scott. I mean recognizing that every Medicare Advantage season seems a little different and you guys are kind of learning as you go along here in this business, what gives you confidence that you can ultimately scale those customer costs? Are we looking at something that's structural, recognizing there's seasonality? Or is this -- do you get better every year, you go through the process? Do you get more efficient? What -- how do we think about that longer-term in terms of being able to scale what is still a really big piece of your health care business?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes, so there's really 2 parts to it. One is the synchronization of our capacity with our customer's actual demand. And I'll just highlight that it's a little hard for them to know sometimes also, actually, so -- but we do have opportunities to do a better job of that in close collaboration with our customers. And we've already spoken about that. Secondly, there are opportunities to try to automate certain elements of the process overall. And we're certainly at work at those as well. So it will really be a combination of both of those.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And switching gears a little bit to Argus. Mark, one of the things I think you called out when you were going through the drivers is international expansion. How much of that business is rest of world now? And what are the relative growth rates when you look at the 20%-plus organic you put up this quarter?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So the Argus business, I think we've always described a couple different ways they grow. And part of it, they do what are kind of like industry-standard study inside of either the card space or the debit card space. And we've talked about taking that platform and extending it into other geographies. About 30% of the business is that international flavor. And we think we can kind of move out into a couple other regions, and we see promise there. With that industry-standard study, I'll refer to it as that, there's been solutions in specialized products that come with that because people want to dig deeper. So that's the second act inside of a kind of a new country or a new set of customers in a different geography. Separately, as we talk about growth, we've talked about things that have been very positive around kind of advertising effectiveness. And with partners, we've started to make some nice progress there to kind of work on the side of kind of more traditional advertising and then kind of the newer-way media. So those have been kind of ways we've grown. And I think we've talked about at least mid-teens growth there. And that's a promising kind of third act inside of what we think is a very, very great business model that Argus has.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.", "Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "On the DA margins, can you just help give us order of magnitude of how much of the year-over-year contraction is due to the Medicare Advantage side of things and how much of it's due to the investments in the innovation agenda?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So I would -- let me try to parse it a little bit. I think Scott has kind of given a lot of this in broad terms. But some of the margin erosion that you're seeing from year to year, I would say more than half is health care related. And then I would say the other half is kind of that innovation agenda and scaling up so that we are able to continue to satisfy and grow our businesses more broadly across that DA segment. So a little more than half on health care, a little less than half on kind of that innovation and re-platforming agenda that we're on.", "Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then with the website relaunch, couldn't help but notice that it seems like you're featuring retail as a market more prominently. Can you just talk about the go-to-market there, how tailored the solutions are and if it's repurposing existing capabilities and data assets or if at some point you may need to do something from the acquisition standpoint to move more aggressively into that market?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, maybe your -- taking your question back to front. We do think there are some interesting assets out there with respect to retail. And maybe just a word on why retail, why interest in retail. Our method, the kind of what we do works best when we are inside of large markets that have a relatively large number of players that are relatively homogeneous with respect to the way they operate and the problems they confront. And all of those statements apply to retail. So that's the fundamental basis for interest. We're already in the retail business. We already serve retailers. And most of the -- sort of the energy that you're picking up from us is our interest in trying to find a way to essentially deepen the analytics that retailers make use of as they try to run their businesses, to move from something which is more sort of kind of elegant reporting about what's going on to something that we're really making kind of more forward-looking statements. And that's really the Verisk way. That's what we do, is we capture more data, we deepen the analytics and we move towards forward-looking statements for our customers. And that's -- and we're just on the march in that way inside of retail. So that's the energy that you're picking up from us on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So back in March, CoreLogic acquired Marshall Swift/Boeckh. And I wanted to ask whether that changes the competitive landscape for that piece of the business. With MSB with about 80% of underwriting and Xactware with about 80% of claims, what happens next?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "So yes, thanks for the question, Bill. First of all, I just -- without getting highly specific, I think the way that you sort of laid it out there on sort of the relativities on claims and underwriting, not really quite where we see it, first of all, just you so you know. I'll also just say kind of at a high level and then I'll kind of get a little bit more specific. At a high level, that we actually think the privileged position in all of this work is actually being deeply into the claims process because that's the -- there, you observe the literal facts of loss. And having a genuine understanding of loss is very, very important to making statements about potential future loss, which is part of the underwriting process. So we just have a view of the integration of those 2 businesses, the way they work together, and a view of kind of where's the highest and driest and strongest place to stand in order to create value for customers. So that, by way of context. We really think that our case in this category is -- it's really on us. In other words, we feel like we have great relationships with our customers and all the scope in the world to bring more value to them. And we feel like we have their full attention. And basically, therefore, it's up to us to be innovative and to be meeting their every need as they try to apply our tools. But we don't walk around feeling like the sort of the cap or the constraint on our growth opportunity is a competitive one. It's really on us and it's really a function of how well we execute our innovation agenda.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then is international expansion an opportunity that you think about for that business line?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Very definitely. And back to the earlier comments, especially in the whole area of estimatics, replacement and repair cost estimating, amplified by aerial imagery and all of the analytics around that, which fundamentally have the effect of creating more automation inside of all of that. That whole combination feels to us like a business which has as much global potential as any that we've got inside of the company.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Mark, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the RA industry standards growth rate and getting it influenced by above-average transactional revenues. I still would guess that even when you take that out, this would be a year of acceleration for RA industry-standard growth. And the thinking there would be while it's not a one-to-one relationship, I do assume that the 2012 acceleration that -- within premiums does inform 2014 RA growth rates. Is that still a fair way to think about it when you take out the above-average transactional revenue growth that you were trying to call out for the first quarter?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Thanks for the question, Bill...", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Andrew...", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Andrew. I apologize. I just want to quickly just draw a distinction. I think we've always talked about kind of the value our customers see in the overall invoice. So certainly, premiums factor into it. I don't think 2014, which relates to 2012 premiums, was the foundation for kind of a more substantial increase. I think we've kind of tried to keep this consistent with the value our customers see. So the process, the approach remains unchanged. What I will kind of draw upon is I think the innovation agenda that we've been discussing here is not just a Decision Analytics agenda. It's also inside of Risk Assessment. So what we try to call out is the predictive modeling solutions that we've now kind of extended beyond personal auto, into homeowners, even the commercial lines, we're starting to gain some traction. We've tried to take some of our rating content and we have created what is a completely automated approach for insurers to bring that content through electronic rating content into their solutions. That has been meaningful. And finally, even inside of some of the workers' comp solutions that we're starting to put out on the market, we're finding traction. And that is contributing to that industry-standard program growth for the year. So some small but good signs of innovation on the Risk Assessment side, as well as Decision Analytics.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I didn't quite -- how much should we think of the kind of growth rate without the element that you tried to call out, the above-average transactional revenues in the first quarter?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yes, Andrew, we're not going to get into that level of detail, I apologize. But I hope you appreciate that we feel that, short of that transactional type of onetimer in the first quarter, we would expect a kind of a continuation into the remainder of the year, as you see Risk Assessment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.", "Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Anj Singh dialing-in for Hamza. I was wondering if we could get an update on your M&A pipeline. Do you view the near- and mid-term pipeline as having more tuck-in acquisitions? Or is there a probability of larger ones like EagleView?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, maybe I can go back to sort of the principle that we're working on, which is that it all sort of flows from our strategy. So what we start with is a view of the verticals that we're serving and the mix of solutions that our customers are looking for. And fundamentally, the reason we engage in M&A is that if there are great solutions out there which we feel we can amplify by tying them into what we already do, and if they're -- and if that's positive for our customers, that's really why we're on the M&A agenda. So we're proceeding from really a market-driven, customer-driven view of what's needed and wanted and then how does our current portfolio stack up against that. So inside of that, we don't really start by filtering on size. I mean, even yesterday, we had a very deep session looking at a very large number of companies that are in our pipeline. And the filtering mechanism does not begin with size. It begins with relevance. And so there's an openness to what it is that makes sense. Having said that, one of the things that we have to give attention to is the integration of anything that we acquire. And so I would say that, all else equal, something which is a little bit smaller is a little bit easier to integrate. And so that's always running in the back of our minds, but again, the point of departure is where are we strategically in the market, what do our customers need. And really, size is -- size obviously gets consideration as we think about our capital structure and where we're at, at any given moment, but it's down the road in terms of the thought process.", "Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up, are you still comfortable with the July closing that you'd outlined for EagleView?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, earlier in my comments, I said third quarter, and that's still where we are.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman from SIG.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I'll just ask a couple upfront, if I could. The first one is, was there any weather, Scott, that you might call out in the first quarter results? The second one is, Mark, you had articulated some of the costs that seasonally recur in the second quarter. Maybe if you could refresh us on that. And then third, to go back to the health care question, Scott, did the first quarter results come in -- first of all, congratulations on the acceleration in health care. But I wanted to ask, did the first quarter results on the revenue come in consistent with your previously articulated expectation of mid-teens growth on the top line. So I know it's a lot upfront, but the first, on weather; the second, on costs; the third, on health.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "All right. I'll take the first and the third, and then if Mark can remember your second question, he'll address that one. So weather sort of is always in the mix of things that we're doing, but I would not call out weather as a -- as having particular explanatory power in terms of the first quarter, meaning there are always weather events, always. And sometimes, they fall in the first quarter, and sometimes, in the third quarter; some years, a little bit more, some years a little bit less. At any given moment, you can actually almost trace a line between events and claims volumes and how that relates to some of the things that we do by way of estimating. But overall, I would not call weather as something that really has much explanatory power as it relates to the quarter. And just more generally, there's just sort of the long sweep of kind of what the weather is doing. Actually, if you want to understand the impact of weather on the insurance business, for example, you actually have to look at 2 things. One is the nature of damage caused by weather, which to some extent -- meaning the intensity of the weather event itself, the intensity and frequency of the weather event itself. And there has been some trend towards increase. But what's actually even more important is the amount of insurable property and its proximity to where weather-driven events tend to occur. Then it's actually -- that actually has greater explanatory power. So for example, Americans' desire to live on the coast of Florida has a lot to do with the increase in hurricane losses through time, as well as what's happening with respect to hurricanes. So I hope that's clear. With respect to the health care question, no. I mean we feel very comfortable observing the first quarter and reaffirming we're expecting mid-teens. So Mark, maybe you want to take on the second question.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure. Thanks. So second quarter, if you recall the way we manage our compensation at Verisk, second quarter is kind of the introduction of salary increases. So we kind of have across-the-enterprise performance reviews. And salary increases are effective with the beginning of 2Q. So that's an uptick from 1Q. What we also do kind of on April 1 is we provide and grant equity. That's both in the combination of options as well as restricted stock for our senior team, and that amount would also hit second quarter. Obviously, 4 years ago, grant would come off. There's a little bit of kind of ebbs and flows based upon an approach we have with PRH62 [ph]. You accelerate vest, but usually, that number is generally up a little bit, trends up. And the other thing that affects quarters is the nature of the health care business does have some seasonality, right? The second half is a little stronger than the first half. There's the Medicare Advantage plans kind of go through that review process we described. That runs through kind of Valentine's Day. So second quarter is a little bit of a trough, and there are some variable costs associated with that. So as a result, you would think of the costs being generally down or in line with kind of that top line. So those are the 3 things that kind of ebb and flow with regard to expenses in 2Q relative to 1Q.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi from Janney Capital Markets.", "Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "This is Jeff Rossetti on for Joe. Just if I could ask a question back on health care. I just wanted to see, as you target mid-teens growth, how do you expect some of the acceleration for revenue and quality versus population and payments?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "We need the whole suite to be performing in order to achieve our goals. And we -- if you -- when you look at the way that our performance builds, and we've had a chance to share this with folks in forums like Investor Day, the cross-selling of our full suite is a big, big focal point for us. And it goes in all directions, so an RQID customer adopting Payment Accuracy solutions or Payment Accuracy customers adopting Enterprise Analytics solutions, et cetera. All those connections are meaningful to us. And it's not that we focus on some and deemphasize others. They all matter.", "Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just maybe a bit going back to you mentioned at the analyst day just those drivers. I think you'd called out coverage expansion. I just wanted to see if there was any updates on signings and the update on the product that was launched recently for ACOs with respect to your quality suite.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I'm not quite sure I understand what you meant when you said coverage, but with respect to the ACO suite, we continue to make progress on that front. That's a very exciting part of our business. Those of you who are familiar with health care know that, that is a very sort of nascent and emergent part of the health care mix. But we -- one of the leading indicators to us, our relevance in the space, is our ability to do work with emerging ACOs. And we have a good team working on that. And so that's meaningful to us.", "Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I was just referring to -- on the other question on the exchanges, insurance exchanges, like meaning expansion of a potential...", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Oh, I understand. Yes, we consider -- yes, so we consider exchanges as essentially another segment of customers. And we're on that, as we are on the other segments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.", "Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Sorry to go back to health care, but your guidance for mid-teen growth in the unit implies some sizable acceleration from the 8-plus-percent growth you saw in the first quarter. Is that something we should expect to gradually see through the year? Or do you think you'll finish the year at much higher than the mid-teens rate in order to get there?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Let me just come back to, I think, what we were trying to describe. I think we feel that from a capacity planning perspective, we're making good progress, and Scott highlighted this. But even with the way we think of our suites and our solutions, we are trending more towards focusing on the customer needs and what solutions plug in. We were running the business a little bit more around the various product sets. And now we're working more closely with what does the customer need. So it's a focus that is, I think, more directly attributable to customer, as opposed to product. Inside that, kind of across the board, the seasonal aspect of it is still that Medicare Advantage. So that does ramp the overall volumes towards the second half of the year. So just remember, it's a first half versus second half as we always described, the second half being more on the 60% and maybe 40% on the front. I would tell you, though, that the mean -- the quarters, from a growth perspective, I don't see them as meaningful. I think we are looking for, yes, a growth in the ramp from what is 8% up to mid-teens, and that should kind of be across the quarters.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "All right, just for absolute clarity, ramping in a way that the average for the whole year is mid-teens. So you're -- you've done the math correctly.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yes.", "Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then just going back to the EVT acquisition, can you remind us what milestones are needed before closing? Are these things that you're going to be discussing publicly?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Sorry, ma'am, we just wanted to -- we wanted to answer that question. So the -- so EVT -- pardon me?", "Unknown Executive", "[indiscernible]", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. Principally, we -- what we're in is in the FTC review process. And we commented on the fact that we got the second request. And we're in that -- in the process of working through the second request right now, and that's pretty much it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.", "Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "It's Adrienne calling in for Paul Ginocchio. I was wondering if you could comment on what the impact of the U.S. government's pending approval of allowing the sale of high-resolution satellite images would have on the EagleView acquisition, and also any expected changes that would have on the competitive landscape.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Right. Thank you for the question. No impact. There remains a distinction between what can be gleaned from an image captured from the sky versus an image captured from a satellite. And without sort of belaboring the technology: It's a different sensing mode on a satellite than it is a camera in the belly of an airplane. And the satellite is looking through the atmosphere in a way that the camera in the plane is not. And so you sort of start with that and you have different properties in the image, and then beyond that, a lot of what applies as well is the ability to get a number of orthogonal and oblique images of the same structure. And aerial imagery is advantaged in doing that in a way that satellite imagery is not. Satellite imagery has advantages, for sure, but as it relates to what we're trying to do, it's the kind of precision that one can get from an aerial image. And what are called the radiometric properties of the image are very significant in what we're looking to do, so really no impact. But I will say also, however, those of you who are going to be following our company through time, as we try to mine aerial images, there may be different modalities in which they're gathered. So for example, all the discussion about drones is interesting to us. And fundamentally, if there's a way to get the precise images that we're looking at in a more efficient way, a la a drone, that's actually a good thing for us. We would be open to that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "This is Rayna Kumar, for David Togut. Could you please quantify your price increase this year in Risk Assessment?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "We don't actually think of it that way. That's not even how we work on it, really. I think that maybe there are some folks out there who are aware of our pricing algorithm, which has in it a -- one of the terms in the algorithm is to reference industry premium volumes. And that, I can certainly understand where that would create an impression, which is effectively there's just sort of a ratchet in the invoices that we're sending out year-over-year, but that's actually not the way that it works. What we do is we take account of the amount of value that we've added in the suite. And so there's actually a great deal of work that goes on every year to have as much relevant and timely information inside of the underwriting rules, inside of the loss costs that we publish, and that is part of the work that we do each year. I will go back to what Mark said also, that inside of Risk Assessment, there are new categories of solutions. And the growth there is really a function of adoption. But back to the industry-standard programs that we talked about in the past, it's not really about price. It's about value. It's about what did we do to improve the product.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Do you expect margin improvement in 2014 to occur in both your Decision Analytics business and your Risk Assessment business during the second half?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So this is Mark. I think what we tried to describe is the fact that we would say flattish for the full year 2014. That's an enterprise-wide view. I think what you've also heard is that we did spend a little bit more inside health care satisfying some customers. So there's probably a little bit more expansion in the DA side of things than the RA side of things. RA is obviously pretty special with regard to margins today.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "And again, we've said that we're a back-half company as it relates to margins generally.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I apologize in advance if this question was asked in some form, as I'm jumping on a bit late here. But I'm sure -- I heard there were a number of health care questions asked. I was wondering if there was any specific color you can provide on how the individual businesses are doing, what the trends have been, even if it's just, say, a range, as opposed to a specific percentage. I know there's a focus on cross-selling and selling at the needs of the customer, but it'd be helpful to understand if there is a material difference between, say, Payment Accuracy and RQI.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "We haven't really sort of broken it out in that way, but -- and I'm not sure if you heard the comment before, but we really are very focused on all parts of the suite performing, both because of the growth that can be contributed by the different elements of the suite, but as well, we believe that we actually become a more compelling partner to our customers the more that they actually make use of our full suite. And you all know that we have been at work for some time to make sure that we have commonality operating underneath the product platforms with respect to data definition and rules, warehousing. And that remains our view, that it's sort of the -- that we really are greater than simply the sum of our parts explicitly. And that is very much our view of the business and what matters and where we're at and where we're going.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, even understanding that you're going to market as a cohesive suite, are you guys seeing more requests or responsiveness to certain parts of the suite? Or is that just not something you're willing to get into?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I think the measure for us is whether or not we can get into a deep dialogue with the leaders in the business and have something relevant to say across essentially all of their decisioning needs. And that is our focus. And we work very hard to make sure that we can go out and have conversations which are very broad with our customers. And I think that we're encouraged by that. And I think that we feel we see the fruit of that in terms of our enhanced standing with the name-brand companies in the health care space.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the back -- call back over to the -- our presenters for any closing remarks.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you. We would just like to thank everyone for your interest and for joining us on our first quarter earnings call today. And we look forward to talking to you again in the near future.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Eva Huston, you may begin.", "Eva Huston", "Thank you, Latoya, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our second quarter 2011 financial results.", "With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following some comments by Frank, Scott and Mark highlighting key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions.", "The earnings release referenced on the call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investor section of our website at verisk.com.

Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "And, with that, I will turn the call over to Frank Coyne.", "Frank Coyne", "", "Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In second quarter 2011, we delivered strong performance at 16.2% revenue growth and 24.2% adjusted diluted EPS growth. We performed well in many of our businesses and our recent acquisitions contributed as well. We were pleased to see Risk Assessment growth at 4.6% for the quarter and 4.5% year-to-date, as our continued value to customers is reflected in our revenue growth. Our insurance-facing solutions in Decision Analytics grew over 20% and 14% organically. Our healthcare solutions continued to show growth and we are working hard to implement our sold solutions for clients which will allow recognition of contracted revenue. Supply chain remains an area of focus and promise for us.", "Overall, our organic growth was 8.8%, a meaningful improvement versus first quarter 2011. We improved Decision Analytics organic growth in Q2 to almost 13%, driven by both improved growth from insurance-facing solutions as well as a return to positive growth for our mortgage solutions. The mortgage market continues to represent a challenge for us as well as other companies. Mortgage insurers continue to confront difficulties achieving sufficient capital requirements, resulting in a major insurer recently announcing its potential inability to write new business without receiving an extension of a capital waiver. It is unclear at the moment how that may affect the broader mortgage market.", "We are clearly focused on our mortgage business and managing it through the volatile macro environment. But even with the uncertainties in the mortgage marketplace, we believe the strength and diversity of our solutions across multiple verticals will lead to strong overall performance.", "I said on our first quarter call that we expected to see improvement in total organic growth for full-year 2011 compared to first quarter results and we delivered improvement in the second quarter. Additionally, we continued to have strong conviction around our margin and overall profitability.", "Excluding the recent acquisitions, our EBITDA margins in Q2 were almost 46%. Speaking of our acquisitions, we were excited to integrate both Bloodhound Technologies and Healthcare Partners into our various health solutions. We were making client calls with all these tools in hand and receiving good response.", "In the quarter, we were also able to continue to drive what I believe is most important to delivering shareholder returns, EBITDA and free cash flow. We grew our total EBITDA by almost 16% and converted a large portion to free cash flow. In the quarter, we grew our diluted adjusted EPS by about 24%. As always, we\u2019ve remained focus on delivering shareholder returns through growth in our businesses, disciplined acquisitions and our share repurchase program.", "In the quarter, we invested a $141 million in new healthcare assets and purchased over a $140 million worth of shares, while also adding a new $150 million authorization. This level of repurchase was higher than in previous quarters as we saw opportunity to buy shares at an attractive price, bringing ourselves closer to our target capital structure. We believe our repurchase program has been successful and liked the flexibility it provides to ensure we can deploy our capital when prices are appropriate.", "For the rest of 2011, we will remain focus on executing on the plan I laid out at our last call, namely growing insurance revenues through new solutions and cross-selling, further penetration in the healthcare space, managing our mortgage business in the face of a challenging macro environment, and creating shareholder value.", "Scott has been spending a lot of time with our new partners Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners, who we call HRP. So I\u2019ll ask him to share some perspectives on our newest addition HRP as well as our acquisition program and other corporate initiatives.", "Scott Stephenson", "", "Thank you, Frank. As you all are aware we\u2019ve been busy on the M&A front, we\u2019re very excited to add Bloodhound Technologies and HRP to our suite of healthcare analytic solutions. I spoke about Bloodhound on our last call and we continued to see the value in its real-time claims editing solution as well as the benchmarking tools and the end-process ROI available to their customers.", "In June, we added another healthcare asset, Heath Risk Partners, who provide solutions that optimize revenue, ensure compliance and improve quality of care for Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans. Recent data states that the United States will spend about $4.6 trillion on healthcare by 2020 and about 50% of that will be paid by the United States Government. By expanding our footprint to include more payment integrity solutions and tools that help health plans operate profitably, we are positioning to help with these daunting numbers which are obviously a challenge for our nation.", "We have aspirations to continue to grow HRP at a nice pace from the base of around $15 million to $20 million of 2010 revenue. Although the margins are lower than the Verisk enterprise, we expect to drive higher margins in the future due to the operating leverage which is inherent in that business.", "Talking more broadly about our acquisition program, we\u2019re pleased to see good opportunities across multiple verticals and at a variety of sizes. We are open to transactions in all the verticals as well as the supply chain domain.", "We\u2019ve just spent a few days with all of our business leaders and innovation was a very strong topic of conversation and remains right at the top of mind for all of us. We continue to focus on making sure our investment dollars are being spent effectively and that we are aiming at transformational innovation for our customers as well as important incremental innovation to keep our products at the leading edge.", "Let me turn it over now to Mark to talk about our financial results.", "Mark Anquillare", "", "Thank you, Scott. As Frank noted, in the second quarter, we delivered 16.2% revenue growth and 8.8% organic growth.", "For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue continued to lead with", "26.7% growth. Decision Analytics organic revenue growth, which was 12.5% in the quarter, excludes the acquisition of Crowe Paradis, 3E, Bloodhound, and HRP.", "Within Decision Analytics, our loss quantification solutions continue to stand out in this quarter with 34.7% revenue growth, all organic. We continued to benefit from our 2010 new contracts on the claims side. Also all the storms you read about helped our Xactware revenue as many customers submitted higher than usual claim volumes. We continued to see growth in underwriting tools and numerous solutions such as content estimation within loss quantification.", "The revenue growth in fraud identification and detection was 17.5% for the second quarter and 7% organic. We continued to see solid performance in our insurance fraud and related solutions in the quarter and Crowe Paradis contributed. Our healthcare fraud assets continued to perform and their growth was bolstered by the addition of Bloodhound in the quarter. We remained focus on implementing signed contracts in our healthcare fraud tools.", "The mortgage business delivered about 8% growth in the second quarter; a distinct improvement from the first quarter. Forensic audit revenues grew in the quarter based upon increased volumes from certain customers as we told you we expected last quarter. We continue to be in constant conversation with our forensic customers and prospects about their needs for the rest of 2011.", "Underwriting solutions revenue declined in the quarter as mortgage originations in the market declined about 20% versus the second quarter of 2010. Year-to-date our total growth in mortgage was approximately 2%. Meaning, it will be a challenge for us to reach the 10% plus growth rate for 2011 we discussed last quarter. Uncertainty continues in the mortgage market with the latest news of certain mortgage insurers potentially being unable to write new business, because they do not meet minimum capital requirements. However, as Frank stated upfront, we are comfortable with other parts of our business will perform in 2011, leaving us optimistic about our overall business growth and profitability. We also continue to manage the expense side of our business closely.", "In loss prediction, total growth was 39.3% for the second quarter and 7.7% organic. Our catastrophe modeling solutions continued to perform extremely well in the quarter and revenue from climate risk analytic solutions continued to grow nicely.", "In healthcare, we had continued growth in the second quarter and we are seeing a positive response from customers under new solutions from HRP. We remain focused on generating new sales in healthcare. In 2011, we will benefit from the addition of 3E and HRP in the grouping.", "As we discuss Decision Analytics, we have attempted to be responsive to investor questions that seemed focused on the vertical markets we serve. We currently show our Decision Analytics revenue in three themes, fraud identification, loss prediction, and loss quantification. In the future we are considering ways to provide even greater visibility into our vertical related groupings of insurance, mortgage and financial services, healthcare and specialized markets. We believe this will help our investors better understand the markets and how our customers profit from our information.", "Turning to Risk Assessment, we grew revenue 4.6% in the quarter, a continuation of the growth we saw in the first quarter. About 84% of our revenue in Risk Assessment is based on subscriptions and long-term contracts, where our renewal rates are 99% recurring in fairly predictable revenue.", "Our industry standard programs grew 5.7% in the quarter, a continued reflection of the value based price increases from January, and the moderation of premium declines at our customers, as well as customers expanding their use of industry standard programs in ancillary solutions.

EBITDA increased 15.7% for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was at 43.9%. Our EBITDA includes a $3.4 million benefit from the reduction and earn-out liability for two of our acquisitions, Strategic Analytics and D2Hawkeye. The way we structure our announce is that they are paid for performance significantly above and beyond our internal forecast for those businesses at the time of the acquisitions. While the acquisitions both performed well, we do not believe they will exceed our 2011 earn-out targets to qualify for incremental payouts to sellers. While the year now has caused some unusual accounting beginning with acquisitions closed in 2009, we continue to believe that benefits out waive the negatives. The structure provides a bridge between our internal expectation for a business versus those of the seller, while helping align the goals of our new management team with the Verisk corporate objectives.", "Our consolidated EBITDA margin was lower in the second quarter as we told it would be during our first quarter call. This is in large part due to our annual salary increases and higher stock option expenses resulting primarily from accelerate investing at age 62. Salary increases are an annual event, but I were to adjust for the increase in the option expense, the recent acquisitions and the reduced earn-out liability, the margin would have exceeded 45%. While the salary increases are obviously ongoing we will recruit some of the stock option expense later in the year as the accelerate investing means that we don\u2019t have to expense those later.", "In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were at 48.5% versus 49.3% in second quarter of 2010, and 52.8% in the first quarter. As we discussed in first quarter, we had incremental cost related to our annual salary increases beginning in second quarter as well as some accelerated stock option expense related to employees who attained age 62. Absent those items, the margin would have been over 52%. And margin in Decision Analytics has improved to 40.4% in the second quarter. The benefit of the earn-out liability adjustment which was all reflected in Decision Analytics was offset by increased salaries and option expense. Additionally, the margin was adversely impacted by 2.8% by the new acquisition in the second quarter.", "Our healthcare, loss quantification and weather analytics businesses led to improvement in the underlying margin in the quarter.", "Our interest expense was up a little more than $6 million versus 2010, as we increased our borrowings to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Also, in the quarter, we closed on a new 10-year $450 million bond offering, which was at a fixed rate of 5.8%. We used the proceeds from the bond to pay down the full $295 million outstanding on our revolving bank debt, which remains available for re-borrowing, and the remaining cash of approximately $150 million was used to fund the Bloodhound acquisition, and we pay a maturing private placement. We\u2019re very pleased to have tapped the market for long-term capital at historically low rates.

(Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Jim Kissane of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "", "Thanks and good job, guys. Was the improvement in mortgage primarily a function of resolving the bottleneck or do you see some of the stepped up volume from the GSEs and benefits of new contracts? And, maybe, just following on that, what\u2019s a reasonable target for growth in mortgage this year? It sounds like you\u2019re stepping off the 10% which very reasonable given what\u2019s going on. But what\u2019s the reasonable target?", "Frank Coyne", "Scott will take the first half of that and I\u2019ll take the second.", "Scott Stephenson", "", "It was really two \u2013 well, you kind of answered your own question, Jim. The GSEs have been stepping their demand for our services and the bottleneck issue associated with the mortgage insurers also subsided, and that was the effect that we\u2019re reciting as you know kind of fourth quarter last year, first quarter this year. So those are really the two things that principally explained where we came out in the second quarter.", "Frank Coyne", "", "Yes. And we\u2019re obviously pleased with the second quarter 8% growth in the mortgage business, that\u2019s a nice turnaround from the first quarter. But it is a 2% year-to-date, so it required an extraordinary performance in the second half to get to 10% for the year. The only thing I can say about mortgage at this time with certainty is that the uncertainty has increased as opposed to decrease since last we had spoke. But the value of our products is being demonstrated to our current customers and to new customers, so we like our business. But it would be I think a disservice to all of our stakeholders to try to predict what our growth is going to be for the rest of the year.", "Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "And then what kind of exposure do you have to these insurers to have some capital issues, is it material?", "Frank Coyne", "", "Jim, I think in the short run \u2013 in the short-term, the impact of the mortgage insurers\u2019 inability to write new business if it comes about could be a positive to us as opposed to a negative. And, over time, I think all \u2013 the policymakers believe that mortgage insurance is important to a healthy real estate market and we know a housing market and we know that\u2019s important to our economy. So it\u2019s hard to predict where that\u2019s going to turnout, but we don\u2019t expect an immediate impact.", "Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "And, Frank, in the press release, you sounded a positive tone around P&C premiums.", "Frank Coyne", "Right.", "Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "Can you take a stab of where you think growth in P&C premiums can trend over the cycle?", "Frank Coyne", "", "Well I think Jim; I think it\u2019s a continuation of what I observed last time. I think I said that we \u2013 at a minimum we had bottomed out. And I think what we\u2019re seeing now is, is that by a line those that are in negative territory are less negative and there is more positive. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to see the trends that we\u2019re seeing in P&C which is positive for us.", "Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. If you don\u2019t mind if I can get one last one. Just on D2 \u2013 D2Hawkeye and Strategic Analytics, it sounds like you have pretty aggressive earn-out targets, but would you say that those two companies are achieving your, let\u2019s say, target for a 15% organic growth as I think about Decision Analytics?", "Frank Coyne", "", "What we\u2019re seeing in those companies is they\u2019re achieving our expectations. Our earn-outs are designed to pay for extraordinary performance and within a certain timeframe. And those companies did not achieve the extraordinary performance, but we think they are in track to satisfy the predictions that we put into our model.", "Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Frank Coyne", "Yes sir.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Riggs of William Blair. Your line is open.", "Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair", "", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned you are going through the implementation process on some of your recent wins in healthcare. I\u2019m assuming in the early straight stages that\u2019s a bit of a drag on profitability. About how long does it take to get to breakeven and to a more full run rate for those healthcare wins?", "Mark Anquillare", "Yes, the implementation phase it varies little bit by customer. But the right range to think about there is sort of 60 days to 90 days and that\u2019s once kind of all the parameters of the implementation have been described, and so we are in the middle of a great deal of implementation activity right now, and I think that you should expect therefore that. And your observation is right that the \u2013 all the effort proceeds the revenue. So you should expect that we\u2019re going to be in that mode for substantially all of 2011. There are 50 plus implementations that we\u2019re working on right now just in the payment and integrity space. And so that will predominate for the rest of the year. 60 days to 90 days.", "Scott Stephenson", "And just to give a little more color. I mean this is in a large part of the fraud side of things where we go as fast as customers want to go. In some cases they operate by state or regions and they have rollout plans that span years because of \u2013 they intend to kind of rollout in a disciplined way. So don\u2019t think of it is the rollout takes that long, it\u2019s just that\u2019s how it\u2019s planned and phased by our customers in many cases.", "Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair", "Okay, great. And then could you just comment on how the new business pipeline for healthcare looks maybe versus six months ago? And any notable examples where having Bloodhound and HRP are bringing new deals to the table?", "Frank Coyne", "Absolutely. Yes so the pipeline has definitely improved. Basically we\u2019re just standing up even taller as a provider of a lot of the solutions that a healthcare payer would require now that we have got payment integrity, we have got medical intelligence, we have got enterprise analytics. So when you actually look at the landscape of healthcare data analytic vendors, we actually have a broader portfolio than many of \u2013 many of the others. So that positioning is helping us for getting additional attention.", "With respect to the integration, we have live examples of customers who have observed that the range of things that we can do in payment and integrity all the way from pre-adjudication to the backend of the process has actually caused them to ask us to effectively integrate our solutions that on their behalf and it has led to some pretty substantial expansion of some of our largest relationships inside a healthcare. So the early returns are very good on what we have done.", "Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair", "Great, thank you. Nice results.", "Frank Coyne", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Boyer of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo", "", "Hi, thanks. I think Frank from your comments, it seems like you\u2019re still expecting margins to be up year-over-year excluding the impact of acquisitions. Is that correct?", "Frank Coyne", "Yes.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo", "And then, is it your expectation for organic revenue growth to continue to accelerate into the back half of the year, yet a nice pickup this quarter over the first quarter that you talked and you called that out last quarter?", "Mark Anquillare", "", "I\u2019ll take that real quick. I think we talked about the organic growth accelerating from first quarter. Obviously mortgage does factor into that. But generally we do see some acceleration in the latter part of the year adjusted for some days and things like that from a transactional perspective that do affect us.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. Then, within your healthcare portfolio products, could you just give us a sense of the type of organic growth or the pace of it expanding is it pretty much been stabled or slowing at all?", "Frank Coyne", "Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 again we certainly think that the profile of organic growth for our business is improving. There is a lead time issue with respect to some of the implementations and the pipeline is getting stronger very quickly. So kind of when all of that \u2013 when all of that converges to actually goose the organic revenue growth rate is a little bit hard to predict, but it definitely is moving in the right direction.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. I think you just said 2011 expect you have an implementations in 2012, I guess maybe something more a revenue.", "Frank Coyne", "We\u2019ll get the benefit from the \u201911 implementations that we\u2019re driving.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay, great. And then, Mark, is there anything in the back half of the year we should be aware of as far as modeling?", "Mark Anquillare", "I don\u2019t think there is anything material. I think \u2013 we think of days from an expense perspective as an example. Second quarter had an extra day from first quarter. And I believe that if were to look at the back half, we would see another day or two in the second half relative to the first. I think you\u2019re also aware of the option expense that accelerate investing that we did experience in the second quarter, kind of dissipates a bit in the third and fourth quarter. Everything else is just kind of investment in adding any \u2013 adding bodies to kind of support growth as we progress through the year.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo", "All right, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Meltz of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "Thank you. A couple of questions for you. Just the last guy \u2013 sorry for guy \u2013 the last analyst asked about an organic revenue acceleration. Mark do you \u2013 just to clarify your expecting acceleration versus the nine you did in Q2 or the eight you did in the first half, what\u2019s the reference point, and the answer might be both, but I just want to be clear on that.", "Mark Anquillare", "", "Sure. I think what we are seeing is 6.6 in the first quarter, the 8.8 in the second which is about 7.7 overall. That \u2013 we have limited visibility on mortgage from the standpoint of pinpoint. I think that number for the rest of the year I think it feels about right. That\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not sure we have a greater visibility with regard to organic growth.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "So you think that 8 is a run rate is what you\u2019re saying.", "Mark Anquillare", "Yes, as I said, I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics. I think you asked \u2013 I think the question was whether we like to ramp whether we saw the expect \u2013 we expect organic growth to continue, we like where we are year-to-date. I mean that\u2019s the direct comment.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "So you don\u2019t \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t be expecting an acceleration from the 9 in Q2.", "Mark Anquillare", "Not off the 2Q. I think we were \u2013 we were talking \u2013 I was talking about from a year-to-date perspective.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, okay. And then the question about mortgage, your \u2013 just to be clear, I know you don\u2019t have the visibility you\u2019d like, but you do expected to grow for the year.", "Frank Coyne", "Well, we don\u2019t have the visibility we\u2019d like, but \u2013 and I\u2019ll tell you we spend a lot of time with our customers obviously, but an extraordinary amount of time whether the customers are trying to map out where they\u2019re going. And what we\u2019ve learned is they cannot predict where they\u2019re going. So it\u2019s very difficult for us to say what\u2019s going to happen there in the mortgage business and that\u2019s \u2013 it gets to the question that you were just asking Mark, the organic growth is impacted by our mortgage business. But it is 10% of our business and we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence around the other 90%.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And so to your question to Jim\u2019s \u2013 or your answer to Jim\u2019s question where you said the mortgage insurer that\u2019s asked for the capital waive likely won\u2019t hurt you. Is that \u2013 that\u2019s just implying that they are not a large customer of yours, is that what you\u2019re saying?", "Mark Anquillare", "", "No. What it really is implying that the services that we provide for them right whether they\u2019re writing new business or not or still a valuable services that will continue and may even increase.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "Okay.", "Frank Coyne", "What we do for them Michael is more related to their existing book than the book that they\u2019re building at any given moment. So we\u2019re worked \u2013 we are working with them on issues that are currently there inside of mortgage insurance that they originated some point in the past. Yes, thanks for that clarification.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Yes. And then \u2013 and so your point on mortgage that new originations are weak, they\u2019ve been weak all year and that\u2019s the uncertainty rather than a new wrinkle on the mortgage insurers side.", "Frank Coyne", "", "Yes. I think that certainly is our point currently, but the entire environment around mortgage and even the pressure on the originators and the banks on how they deal with their delinquencies is \u2013 it has an impact on timing, et cetera as to how quickly they may get turned over for \u2013 to us for auditing works. So there is a lot of moving parts there. But, yes, even though originations are down say 20%, our business is not \u2013 our business for originators is not down 20%. I mean we\u2019re gaining new \u2013 we\u2019re gaining new customers, we\u2019re writing \u2013 we\u2019re developing new products, our value proposition is strong. So though we\u2019re going to go through a period of time with some bumpiness, we think it\u2019s a very good business.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then my final question, I think with the recent acquisitions your pro forma, say roughly $100 million of healthcare revenues, can you just \u2013 given the \u2013 just talk a little bit about the mix. I mean how do you \u2013 I know \u2013 I\u2019m not asking about fraud versus loss prevention, but if you think about it, I don\u2019t know how you want to describe it, payment integrity versus benchmarking versus fraud or \u2013 or what buckets, how should we think about the buckets as to what your portfolio is right now?", "Scott Stephenson", "I think we \u2013 we just think of the frontend which is the loss protection side of healthcare being the combination of what has historically have been our operations that operate out of Waltham, it\u2019s a Massachusetts based business that we\u2019ve had for sometime, and HRP is more closely aligned with that side of the business. Separate and apart from that, we\u2019ve talked about HCI which is our healthcare insights business which is on the fraud side of things, that\u2019s being reporting fraud and fraud protection. And Bloodhound are too on the payment and integrity that claims editing business is probably more aligned with that backend and that [inaudible] inside of our themes, inside of Decision Analytics.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "And so frontend versus backend, what would be the rough revenue split?", "Mark Anquillare", "Yes. I think we\u2019ve given you the HRP is in that \u2013 on an annual basis is between 20 \u2013", "Frank Coyne", "15.", "Mark Anquillare", "15 and 20. We\u2019ve also said that HRP is in that \u2013 excuse me, Bloodhound is in that $10 million range from backend. It\u2019s about equally rated today and that\u2019s the best way to describe it. Probably a little bit more on the frontend I think. Probably maybe 60/40.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Okay, thank you for your time.", "Mark Anquillare", "Sure.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Kelly Flynn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Thanks. A couple of questions. Well, I think you guys mentioned weather benefits during the quarter. Can you just give a little more detail on I guess quantifying that as possible and also just describing what went on and then how does that relate to how you think about the organic growth rate over the next couple of quarters, because exactly you\u2019re using for flattening out or slowdown next quarter?", "Mark Anquillare", "Well, let me describe where it comes in. Inside loss quantifications, specifically the Xactware business is a piece of the business where people exceed in the most part minimums on volumes or claims coming through our tools. We do charge per transaction. So there was some severe storms that hit in the quarter and did drive revenue inside of the loss quantification.", "Typically, storm activity takes place in that third and fourth quarter, so this was I wouldn\u2019t say unusual but were heavier than usual, and that that did help us in the quarter. It\u2019s a little difficult to estimate and predict storm activity into the future. I think third quarter and fourth quarter of 2010 were about average, I don\u2019t think there was anything out of the ordinary so. And it\u2019s tough to predict what will happen in 2011 going forward. But, hopefully, I think that helps you understand little bit about the nature of those revenues.", "Frank Coyne", "But we\u2019re not assuming any significant climatic instability in our organic growth numbers.", "Mark Anquillare", "Right.", "Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Can you probably \u2013 can you quantify the impact on the organic growth for the quarter?", "Mark Anquillare", "Yes. I mean it\u2019s difficult to tell relative to last year. You know that it was probably a couple million dollars of revenue.", "Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then, again switching gears to go back to the mortgage business, I know that you\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions about organic growth expectations. But I just \u2013 I want to clarify the \u2013 are you seeing anything and particularly related to the capital extension issue you mentioned that makes you fairly confident that the mortgage growth rate will decelerate over the next couple of quarters or are you just saying so far so good, but we are just calling out the uncertainty?", "Frank Coyne", "It\u2019s more the latter that we\u2019re calling out, which is, we\u2019re observing the same macro environment that you are and we\u2019re observing our own knowledge based on dealing with our customers that their plans change on \u2013 pretty depending on circumstances and so the predictability is very difficult.", "Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.", "Frank Coyne", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Mark Anquillare", "Sure.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Warmington of Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about what you are seeing in the way of M&A opportunities and whether you plan on you think pursuing them aggressively given that you read about 1.9 times gross debt to EBITDA, you have about 2 times target, although of course you could go up to 3 times. But what is your appetite for that now?", "Frank Coyne", "Very high. Mark was referencing our dry powder before, Bill, and that is a fact about our business. There are assets out there that fit our aspirations in terms of where we want to take our business thinking particularly about the healthcare and supply chain domains, those are likely to be the two places where the greatest amount of acquisition activity occurs, and we\u2019re seeing good assets to fit where we\u2019re trying to get to. Between the dry power and the ability to be flexible in the moment, we are very focused on the M&A agenda going forward.", "Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then, there were some references in the opening remarks to benefits in the insurance side from cross-selling. Just want to know if I could ask you to expand on that a little bit.", "Frank Coyne", "Well, I mean the cross-selling is a committed agenda on our part. And, basically, we are doing a variety of things to support the cross-sell. We take a holistic view of a customer, our sales teams are incentivized to try to get our whole suite sold into the accounts. We have executive ownership of our largest accounts. And, basically, if you take a look at that strong organic growth in the insurance part of Decision Analytics, most of that is the effect of cross-selling into the existing Risk Assessment customer base. So it\u2019s a high focus, and to achieve that double-digit organic growth in Decision Analytics, that\u2019s essentially the cross-selling.", "Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then, I wanted to ask also about risk analyzer and how that stands in the regulatory process and whether it\u2019s too early to start talking about revenue generation for that in 2012?", "Frank Coyne", "", "It\u2019s probably a little early to talk about that, but just to note a couple of things, we\u2019re up to 28 approvals on risk analyzer for personal auto. Again, I think that\u2019s kind of a \u2013 sort of a threshold for us will be when we are up to around 40, 45. Most of the premium across the country is embraced in the analytic. We\u2019ve also started to get approvals on our risk analyzer for homeowners when where we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re moved in two states, and we actually now stand really for the first time having made sales of the three lines that we have modeled.", "We\u2019ve now made \u2013 we\u2019ve now got sales into lot \u2013 real customers for written for personal auto, for homeowners, and for commercial auto. So that\u2019s a bit of a milestone in the build. But we\u2019re still a bit \u2013 our value provision is tied strongly to the notion that our analytic is industrial strength and has been approved by the regulators. And, obviously, we are still in process on that. But there is a lot of interest in the marketplace. And as we get more regulatory approvals, we just think that the result will follow. But it\u2019s \u2013 we can\u2019t predict how quickly the state departments of insurance will respond, that\u2019s the X factor here.", "Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Excellent. And thank you for the insight.", "Frank Coyne", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Suzanne Stein of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Hi. You touched on the government\u2019s impact. Can you just maybe quantify what percent of your revenues is exposed to the government and has there been notable change in this part of your business?", "Frank Coyne", "Yes. Less than 3% of our revenue is government contracts. And, no, there has not been any notable in the current contracts that we have with government. We believe based on information that they\u2019re fully funded and so we don\u2019t really expect any short-term issues.", "Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then in healthcare analytics, one of the \u2013 I guess a large competitor announced its intention to exit because it doesn\u2019t think it can scale the business. Why do you think you can and have you seen any change in asset prices helped your acquisitions?", "Frank Coyne", "In reverse order, the prices for healthcare acquisitions have always been high relative to sort of what we see across all the vertical markets that we\u2019re in. I wouldn\u2019t say that there has been any change there, but they\u2019ve always been premium priced assets. And I think that \u2013 I would point to two things about our position.", "One is we do have a distinctive intellectual property operating inside of our business whether it\u2019s on the payment integrity side with the only solution that allows you to get after the claims on a pre-adjudicated basis to our grouping methodology which stands inside of our medical intelligence analytics, the competitor that you\u2019re referencing I just don\u2019t think could make either of those claims.", "And then, secondly, the healthcare is a place where it\u2019s actually good to be a newer competitor. The value of incumbency is high in a lot of the things we do, but it\u2019s much less so in the healthcare space, because customers are not only opened to, they\u2019re actually seeking new solutions. So to be kind of an old form competitor with a big embedded base and a lot of investment in sort of yesterday\u2019s methods is actually kind of a tough place to be. And that\u2019s not our situation.", "Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great, okay. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Frank Coyne", "You bet.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Otis of KBW. Your line is open.", "Matt Otis \u2013 KBW", "", "Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess not to believe the mortgage side of the business, but just a couple from that side. There has been some talking about consolidation in the mortgage insurance sector. Is that something since you guys look at the book of business, is that something that it could actually provide upside for you as well as if there was consolidation and some of the market players were looking at other companies from what\u2019s in their current book of business?", "Frank Coyne", "The most likely impact would be positive.", "Matt Otis \u2013 KBW", "Okay, fair enough. I guess, simple question on the mortgage side. Can you give maybe a little bit of color on what percentage of mortgage goes directly to the mortgage insurers?", "Mark Anquillare", "", "I think we\u2019ve always talked about frontend and backend. So the frontend audit, that presents good chunk of our business, it\u2019s probably about 67% these days.", "Matt Otis \u2013 KBW", "Okay.", "Frank Coyne", "That is not all mortgage insurers.", "Mark Anquillare", "That is not all mortgage insurers, yes, in place.", "Matt Otis \u2013 KBW", "Right, right. And then, I think there was mention of, I know you were talking about from an M&A standpoint healthcare and supply chain being priorities, but I thought I heard you say that all vertical markets would be considered. Is that inclusive of mortgage?", "Frank Coyne", "It is, although, which means that the Sonar is banging away in all of the markets that we serve. I would just tell you that I just don\u2019t think that there are a lot of distinctive assets that would provides the kind of reliable growth that we\u2019re looking for so. And actually our portfolio of solutions is relatively more complete and the things that aren\u2019t there, Matt, we would really be looking more to build than to buy. But, yes, we bang away, the Sonar bangs away in all cases.", "I would also tell you that part of the thought process around mortgage is that I mean fundamentally we\u2019re dealing with financial services organizations, and one of the things that is in the thought process is other lines of business that our customers are engaged in, and whether and how we could do business with them there. So if you\u2019re defining it as mortgage narrowly, I think we actually cover the waterfront reasonably well. But when we extend out to a financial services definition, then the M&A opportunities actually open up a bit.", "Matt Otis \u2013 KBW", "Okay, great. And then, just lastly, I think I don\u2019t know if you did earlier, but maybe Frank starts on the PMC pricing going forward in the back half of the year and into 2012.", "Frank Coyne", "Yes. I think it was probably Jim Kissane who had asked me early on. As I had observed in the past that I thought the market was bottoming out and beginning to turn in certain lines and we\u2019re now seeing that trend, the trend is coming through in various survey and reports from various companies and we expect to continue to see that. And it could be accelerated by various factors. One is a continuation of climatic instability in the second half of the year which is normally when we see it if we have an active hurricane season and if inflation brings its head up then that will clearly have an impact.", "Matt Otis \u2013 KBW", "Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.", "Frank Coyne", "Yes sir.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Hi. I had a couple of model related questions. For the SG&A, it was up about 200 basis points. How much of that increase is due to the acquisition impact versus the increased compensation?", "Mark Anquillare", "So the \u2013 let\u2019s talk about the piece parts. First of all I will highlight that we talked about the stock option expenses specifically accelerate investing, so that \u2013 a chunk of that does affect the SG&A side of things.", "From a salary increase perspective to answer your question directly, that\u2019s more across the board. It\u2019s kind of inflationary in every place. I think of that 3.5% to 4.5% range. And inside SG&A to yield, you\u2019ll have some cost associated with the acquisitions if you think about they\u2019re in the acquisitions but I believe cost transaction fees that no longer are capitalized inside of the purchase accounting. So we need to expense that immediately and we saw some of that in the second quarter in the SG&A side of things.", "Last item, I did mention earlier there was an extra expensed day in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. So if you\u2019re doing a comparison not to last year but a comparison first quarter that is another element of it.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then also related to the model as we go forward, what should we think about the impact to the recent acquisitions relative to the margins in the \u2013 the margins in the second half and into next year?", "Mark Anquillare", "Well, I think we \u2013 just trying to give you a little \u2013 let me give you some more visibility on HRP which is probably the number one [ph], Scott mentioned the $15 million to $20 million of revenue. You are going to see in the world of HRP they do have the lower margins think of 20s. Over time, we would expect that to ramp. But that will have some decrement on the margins within DA for the remainder of the year. We think it\u2019s pretty nominal, but it\u2019s something you would want to consider.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Frank Coyne", "Yes sir.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions).", "Frank Coyne", "All right, well, I want to thank everyone for joining us in the call of this morning and for your continued interest and for the quality of your questions, and looking forward to visiting with you again next quarter.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Verisk treasurer and head of Investor Relations, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.", "Eva Huston", "Thank you, Tequila, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our third quarter 2011 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Frank, Scott and Mark, highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions.", "The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.", "A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in for 30 days until December 2nd, 2011. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of the press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Frank Coyne.", "Frank Coyne", "Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In third quarter 2011, we delivered strong performance of 18.4% revenue growth and 25% diluted adjusted EPS growth. We performed well in many of our businesses and our recent acquisitions contributed as well. Risk assessment grew 2.7% for the quarter and 3.9% year-to-date, as our continued value to customers is reflected in our revenue growth.", "Excluding the property specific category risk assessment growth in the third quarter was closer to 5%. We faced some challenges in our property specific revenue, which we will discuss on this call and that weighed on risk assessment growth in the quarter. In the quarter, Decision Analytics revenue grew over 30% and our insurance-facing solutions and Decision Analytics grew almost 17% of organically. Our health care solutions revenue grew over 25% organically, as we implemented our solutions for clients. Supply chain remains an area of focus and promise for us.", "Overall, our organic revenue growth was 7.6% in the quarter and also year-to-date. Decision Analytics\u2019 organic growth in Q3 was about 12%, driven by both accelerated growth from insurance-facing solutions as well as the strong growth in health care. The mortgage market continues to represent a challenge for us as well as other companies in the space and our revenue declined in the quarter.", "We are keenly focused on our mortgage business and managing it through the volatile macro environment while not losing site of the 90% of our business that has both near-term and long-term growth opportunities. We continue to have conviction around our margin and overall profitability. We are pleased to deliver 25% growth in diluted adjusted EPS and 16% growth in EBITDA while expanding margins excluding recent acquisitions to almost 46%.", "As always, we remained focused on delivering shareholder returns to growth in our business, disciplined acquisition, and our share repurchase program. While no new acquisitions were announced in this quarter, we are seeing the benefit of both financially and from a customer perspective of the 2Q acquisition. We also continue to hunt for the right opportunities. In share repurchases, we bought a 123 million of shares, a lower amount in 2Q as we continue to manage our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan including acquisition.", "As we move through the final quarter of 2011, we are focused on positioning our business to perform both through challenging times as we have for the past few years as well as into the future when we see our economy return to a better growth environment. While our strong performance in a weak environment is notable, we believe we will perform even better as our clients see better performance in their businesses.", "Improvement at our customer\u2019s hand in the economic outlook, we\u2019ll make it easier for them to spend incremental dollars of new solutions and re-engineering processes that may have been delayed in a weaker environment. Our customers have thrown their interest in new solutions during our customer conference n October, when we met with about 150 executives from leading P&C insurers.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to talk about the progress we are making in a number of our business areas.", "Scott Stephenson", "Thank you, Frank. As we further our growth agenda, we remained focused on innovation as an important part of our business process. As you hear about new developments such as our claims tools for REO properties that is real estate owned by the lenders through a foreclosure process, or our vehicle symbols as part of our risk analyzer suite were nucleus, which is our new delivery platform for Verisk Health (inaudible) Solutions or our expanding insurance catastrophe modelling solutions.", "You should know there are many other ideas behind those that we are working to develop and eventually commercialize. It\u2019s important for us to be innovative as none of our markets stand still. This also requires the commitment to invest which we continue to do.", "Speaking of growth, the pieces of our health care strategy are coming together nicely and the traction we\u2019re feeling in that business is positive. While you can see our quarterly results in our supplemental data, we\u2019re pleased with 25% organic revenue growth in the quarter and important point to me is that we\u2019re seeing the synergy of bringing Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners into the fold. We\u2019re going to market today as Verisk Health, which is being well-received by our customers.", "With tools for population management, performance measurement and compliance and the payment integrity, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to grow. And while our business with a run rate of over $100 million of revenues reaching a meaningful scale for us, the size of our revenue today pales in comparison to about $2.5 trillion of annual health care spent. I\u2019m optimistic and our team is optimistic that we can do more.", "We continue to be encouraged about 3E and our supply chain team as it develops. We\u2019re seeing many areas of crossover with solutions we provide in weather and catastrophe analytics, cargo solutions and others. And we believe that interesting acquisition targets as well as organic growth exist in this space.", "Let me turn it over now to Mark to talk about our financial results.", "Mark Anquillare", "Thank you, Scott. As Frank noted, in the third quarter, we delivered 18.4% revenue growth and 7.6% organic revenue growth. For the third quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue continued to lead with 32.5% growth. Decision Analytics organic revenue growth, which was 11.9% in the quarter, excludes the acquisition of Crowe Paradis, 3E, Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners.", "This quarter, we have introduced supplemental revenue within Decision Analytics segment to help you follow the changes as they relate to the vertical hand market themes, in addition to the (inaudible) loss prediction and loss quantification. We have not change in any of our historic financial results. We hope this transparency helps your understanding of our historical performance and opportunities going forward.", "A few days ago, we provided historic supplemental data back to 2008 for your reference. That data was filed in 8-K and it\u2019s also available on our Investor Relations website. The third quarter release contains the data in the same format for this quarter. In our supplemental data, we provided you Decision Analytics (inaudible) theme insurance, mortgaging financial services, health care and specialized market. We have grouped revenues by the primary end market of the various parts of our business.", "In insurance, we have our insurance fraud solution including claim search, our catastrophe modelling solutions from ARR worldwide, and our insurance [Audio Gap] Decision Analytics.", "In mortgage and financial services, we included our (inaudible) underwriting and forensic audit tools facing the mortgage market as well as strategic analytics business which should also serve our consumer finance markets. This grouping is the same as with mortgage on previous calls. Health care includes all of our tools for Verisk Health including the DxCG, Share Med [ph], D2Hawkeye, HDI, Bloodhound and Heath Risk Partners. And finally, specialized markets include our Climate Risk Analytics as well as 3E component of our supply chain risk management solutions.", "I will reference somehow on this supplemental data. They died into the second performance. Within Decision Analytics, our loss quantification solutions continue to standout in this quarter with 29.8% revenue growth all organic. We continue to benefit from our 2010 new contract on the claim side.", "Also, all the storms you read about including Hurricane Irene helped as many of our customers submitted higher than usual claim volumes. We also continue to see growth in our underwriting tools and newer solutions, such as content estimations with in-loss modification. In the quarter, we had launched XactPRM, our property repair and maintenance tool, which is aimed at the REO market, and we\u2019re seeing interest from potential customer.", "The revenue growth in fraud identification detection was 16% in the third quarter and 4% organic. We continue to see solid performance in our insurance fraud and related solutions in the quarter and Crowe Paradis contributed to the total growth. Our health care fraud assets performed well, with double-digit growth, as we implemented signed contracts for our health care fraud solutions.", "Health care fraud growth was also bolstered by the addition of Bloodhound in the quarter. Also within fraud, our mortgage business declined 4.9% in the quarter in comparison to the peak quarter for mortgage revenue in the third quarter of 2010 as the mortgage remained bumpy. We were not able to fully offset the more than 20% decline originations versus 2010 with new customers increase usage of origination tools. Forensic audit revenues also declined in the quarter as increased volumes from certain customers was more than offset by declining volumes from one large customer.", "We continue to be in constant conversation with our customer in ways we can help. We\u2019ve seen a good pickup from our undisclosed (inaudible) tool and continue to work on new solutions to meet customer needs. However, we expect the mortgage market will remain hard to predict for the remainder of 2011 and, perhaps, beyond.", "In loss prediction, total growth was 69.9% from the third quarter and 14.2% organic. Our catastrophe modeling solutions performed well in the quarter as we continue to add customers and sell new solutions. Large catastrophe events in 2011 have caused insurers and reinsurers to reassess their modeling needs and we\u2019re seeing benefit.", "In health care, we had double-digit growth in the third quarter and we\u2019re seeing a positive response from customers on our new solutions from health risk partners as well as our existing solutions. We remain focused on generating new sales in health care. Our climate risk analytics business growth float as we cycled through a large contract we won in late second quarter of 2010 and as the government \u2013 the US government that is \u2013 looks to stretch out implementations of the contracts due to budgetary constraints.", "In 2011, our total growth has benefited from the addition of 3E and Health Risk Partners in that grouping.", "Turning to risk assessment. We grew revenue 2.7% in the quarter. Our industry standard programs grew 4.8% in the quarter, a continued reflection of the value base price increases from January and a moderation of premium declines at our customers, as well as new customers in 2011. Our premium linkage solutions also continued to add growth.", "Our property specific information revenues declined 4.1% in the quarter because of lower volumes at certain customers we\u2019ve discussed previously. The reasons behind the decline of property specific revenue are mix of a generally weak business environment as well as some changes in processes at certain customers driven by expense control. We have not lost any customers.", "About 85% of our revenue in risk assessment is based upon subscriptions and long-term contracts, with 99% renewal rates, creating recurring in fairly predictable revenue of vast majority of the segment.", "Overall, we are comfortable at enterprise performance even in the face of some specific market issues for the mortgage. Excluding mortgage business, organic growth in the quarter was over 9%. We also continue to manage the expense side of the business very closely.", "EBITDA for the third quarter was $151 million as outlined in the Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 16.2% for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 44.4% as our consolidated EBITDA margin increases in the third quarter compared to 43.9% in the second quarter of 2011, and 42.9% excluding the benefit of the acquisition related liability earn-out.", "In the quarter, our risk assessment margins were 50.5% versus 48.7% in the third quarter of 2010 and 48.5% in second quarter 2011. As we discussed in the second quarter, we had some accelerated stock option expense related to employees who attained age 62, resulting in less expense in the third quarter. We have to reduce certain cost, including the add-in of another cost which benefited the margin.", "And margin in Decision Analytics was 40.1% third quarter versus 38.6% in the second quarter of 2011, excluding the acquisition liability adjustment benefit. Improving underlying margins for several of our businesses as well a mix shift to higher margin solutions benefited us in the quarter, partially offset by the impact from the mortgage business.", "Our interest expense was up a little more than $6 million versus third quarter of 2010, kind of about flat with second quarter of 2011. Also, just after the quarter ended, we closed on an amendment to offer credit facility, which increased the facility by $100 million to a total of $700 million, while also reducing the pricing, extending maturity to October of 2016.", "With the public bond we completed in the second quarter and our upsized revolving credit facility, we have significant debt capacity available to execute on our strategy. We ended third quarter with $160 million of our revolving credit facility drawn. Our reported effective tax rate was 39.2% for the quarter, down a bit due to favorable audit settlements, adjustments for actual state filings in the quarter, the continued execution of our tax planning strategies, and the benefits associated with R&D tax legislation.", "Coming down to the next income line. We focused on the adjusted net income and non-GAAP measure, which we defined, in the current period, as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense, less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 14.7% to $76.3 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.45 for third quarter of 2011, an increase of 25%. The adjusted diluted share count was $171.2 million in the quarter, and on September 30th, 2011, our diluted share count was $170.1 million shares.", "We were active in the quarter with our share repurchase program, purchasing approximately 3.7 million shares. As of quarter end, we had a little less than 50 million left under our share repurchase authorization. As we have purchased approximately 340 million worth of shares year-to-date, I don\u2019t anticipate us going beyond the remaining authorization in 2011.", "Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, our cash and cash equivalence were about $53 million. Total debt both in short-term and long-term were just north of $1 billion at September 30th, about flat the second quarter of 2011, as acquisition closings were quite and we funded share buybacks largely with cash on hand and cash from operation.", "Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 1.8 debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA at quarter-end, well within our covenant, in the zone with our target leverage level of two times. Our debt capacity is about $700 million and will continue to grow with our free cash flow generation and as we add EBITDA from acquired companies.", "Free cash flow in the first nine months of 2011 which we defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures was $275.5 million, an increase of $57.9 million versus first nine months of 2010. Free cash flow increased 27% year-to-date. We\u2019ve benefited from strong profitability and also a temporary deferral of a third quarter tax payment resulting from a federal disaster declaration due to Hurricane Irene for certain countries in New Jersey, including where our corporate headquarters is located.", "We\u2019re still (inaudible) the tax payment in the fourth quarter so you\u2019ll see the benefit reverse itself then. Without the tax deferral and related impacts, our operating cash flow would have been up about 17% and free cash flow would\u2019ve been up about 8%.", "As you remember we discussed major upgrades for our mainframe environment and related software earlier this year, which increased our CapEx year-to-date. Our CapEx in the third quarter was lower as a percent of revenue than the second quarter, about 4.1%. But we\u2019ll finish the year in an elevated level versus 2010 due to those investments.", "We continued our strong free cash flow conversion of EBITDA, which was 64% for the first nine months of 2011. We are pleased with the results in the quarter.", "And with that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Meltz.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you. I think I have two questions for you. Can you talk a little bit about the expectation going forward? The organic growth rate in the third quarter, I guess, is on par with the year-to-date. What\u2019s the expectation going forward? You talked a little bit about within analytics, mortgage remains tough, and I guess you\u2019re saying AER might moderate. But what should we expect for this?", "Mark Anquillare", "Hi, Michael. I think what we feel is strength throughout the business. So I think we continue to believe that organic growth will continue to move kind of down the path that we\u2019ve seen over the first nine months. The caveat to that is mortgage that\u2019s still really difficult to predict.", "So we don\u2019t have great visibility into that, which could be slightly lower than what we\u2019ve seen for the first time.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And then, just a follow-on question to that. I think you had closed one, maybe two of the acquisitions fourth quarter last year. So there\u2019s some cycling. Can you just remind us what to expect on the inorganic side for the upcoming quarter versus a year ago?", "Mark Anquillare", "So, in the upcoming quarter, the fourth quarter, we acquired both 3E and Crowe Paradis in these very latter stages of fourth quarter 2010. There were only a few days in December where we owned both those entities. So you won\u2019t see too much of a grow-over as you think about the fourth quarter. There\u2019s just a few days, maybe a couple of weeks in 2010 without revenue associated with those two entities.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "And then the other question for you, just on the property specific rating business, the fire suppression data. Can you talk a bit more about what\u2019s going on there? I understand what you\u2019re saying about certain customers you\u2019re not \u2013 you haven\u2019t lost contracts. That being said I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve had a downed quarter of revenue there in years. So, can you just give us a little bit more detail, please?", "Frank Coyne", "Yes, Michael. This is Frank here. It\u2019s really a mixed bag that we\u2019re seeing. Part of it is the economy as less business is being written, as we\u2019ve got vacancies in some of the commercial properties. Some of it had to do with customers repositioning their portfolios. And we\u2019ll see some return of that business as they work through that.", "Some of it has to do with process changes within companies where they basically have cut back on their commercial writings for a period of time. And we would expect to see that return once they\u2019ve cycled through their process changes. And some are just redesigns of their own internal processes as a result of expense controls. So, the positive is it\u2019s a whole mixed bag of things and not a trend that we\u2019re seeing in the use of our products.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. All right, thank you for your time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington.", "Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Good morning everyone.", "Frank Coyne", "Good morning.", "Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "I want to see if you could comment on how \u2013 see where the insurance premiums are trending on commercial PNC side. You mentioned you saw some benefits there this quarter?", "Frank Coyne", "Yes. I think as we have observed in the past, our sense was that the market has bottomed out and we were seeing some positive trends. The surveys would indicate that that is what is happening. I think more importantly the results that are being announced by the industry, all of which are our customers, would indicate that premiums are on the rise. And specifically with regard to our line of business, we are certainly seeing that. So, there are positive trends going forward.", "Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "And I wonder if you could comment on \u2013 a little bit about what\u2019s behind the strong pick-up in health care. I think you\u2019ve reach some sort of tipping point in terms of how companies are looking at health care spending?", "Frank Coyne", "Well, I would make a couple observations there and maybe Scott would add. And that is that we\u2019re seeing growth in both our frontend and backend \u2013 the fraud solutions and the underwriting analytic solutions that we have there. So, we\u2019re seeing positive signs in both parts of our business.", "Also we had commented in the past that we had written contracts that we were in the process of implanting. And we are seeing that implementation complete now and just beginning to be able to recognize that revenue.", "Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then final question was that you had mentioned some \u2013 well, it sounded like pent-up demand and the insurance companies coming out of your customer confidence in October. When do you think that that starts to flow through for you in terms of revenue and what segments do you think benefit from that?", "Frank Coyne", "Well, what we specifically saw is that as we introduced our \u2013 some of the ideas that we have around new solutions \u2013 we saw a receptivity to understanding the value of those solutions.", "So, it is hard to tell when the purses will open back up, as clearly as the industries health returns, so the results aren\u2019t bad to the industry. But as premium writings begin to increase, we would expect to see a pick-up in the new solutions that we\u2019re offering.", "Scott Stephenson", "I will just add to that, that one of the strong themes that seem to have caught the imagination of a lot of the insurance companies is the opportunity to better understand the weather and respond and prepare for it. And between climate science and in our capacity modeling, we really have a very unique set of capabilities.", "To Frank\u2019s point, it\u2019s not a spike, it\u2019s more a moving that intellectual property into that processes, which I think will occur steadily but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a step function so much as just a kind of a gradual expansion of what it is we do with the company.", "Bill Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "All right. Well, excellent. Thank you very much for the insight.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn.", "Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. A couple of questions, just first on mortgage. I know you\u2019ve said several times it\u2019s very unpredictable but you said that last quarter and then it\u2019s declined. So, I\u2019m wondering if you can just, maybe give us a little bit of guidance on how you would advice us to model it. You think that business declines over the next couple of quarters or is it really so unpredictable that you have absolutely no idea at this point in the quarter?", "Frank Coyne", "Well, I would say a couple of things and certainly my colleagues could add to it if they desire and that is that, yes, it is unpredictable. Because you see what we see happening the macro environment, so you never know what might come out of Washington, for example. But as we look at our business \u2013 I mean we do have some sense of customer uptake on some of our new products. We just do not know what an individual customer would say. So, I\u2019m not expecting a decline up from this quarter but it\u2019s really hard to predict.", "Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then, just going back to the issue someone else asked a couple of questions ago about the commercial premiums. I know you said that there\u2019s a positive tone there but the Q2 commercial premiums, they grew, but they grew at a slower rate, I believe than they did in the first quarter. So, I\u2019m wondering what you make of that. Do you think it\u2019s possible that this macro weakness may be causing a deterioration there? Or do you just feel like that data tends to jump around and positive is good in general?", "Mark Anquillare", "So, let me first talk about the tangibles like (inaudible) business. I mean, the way our invoices are prepared it\u2019s really the full year. So, we would begin our 2012, we\u2019ll be looking a full year of 2010 premiums. And a full year of 2010 premiums rolled through to 2009, it is better news, okay? Not great news but better news. And so you think about 2013, you\u2019re relating to 2011 premiums full year and that\u2019s better news.", "So, clearly the trend is improving. I think your questions was more industry specific and with the fact that the trends in the industry itself almost appeared to kind of regress a bit or digress a bit. The third quarter \u2013 excuse me, the second quarter premium growth was not as great as what we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter. And I\u2019m not sure we have great visibility into why that was.", "So, you think about some cash fees, there was some activity. That usually puts some pressure. You also kind of see, hopefully, a function of a competition heating up and sometimes that helps us. But the market economy, it can be poor and I think that\u2019s pulling down some of the ability of insurers to increase premiums to their customers. I\u2019m sure (inaudible).", "Frank Coyne", "Yes. And I think actually some of these things tied together as we had a severe cash season as you know. And so that when you have that it \u2013 in particular it impacts the property business. So, as we see some of our customers reacting to that and I mentioned that repositioning of their property portfolio, that is some of the answer behind our specific property as well.", "Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Suzie Stein.", "Suzie Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Just a follow-up on Michael\u2019s question on the spy [ph] database, should we expect that weakness to continue in Q4 or do you have kind of a sense of timing of should when you expect a recovery there?", "Frank Coyne", "Yes. Good morning, Suzie. I would not expect a further decrease in Q4 in that business. And it\u2019s hard to say when it will turn, but we\u2019ve got confidence in that business, in the value proposition associated with.", "Suzie Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And also, when you\u2019re in public you talked about 5% to 7% as being kind of a normalized rate of growth in risk assessment. As we hopefully near the end of the cycle, do you expect that we can get to the high-end of this over the next couple of years?", "Frank Coyne", "Well, as we transitioned out of the cycle we would expect our organic growth in the risk assessment to increase.", "Suzie Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just a final question, can you just talk about how the health of the mortgage insurance market impacts your back-end mortgage business?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yeah, well, that part of our business is transaction-based as you know. So the volume of the folks that are foreclosing loans is basically what drives our revenue there. And a couple of the mortgage insurers have been somewhat constrained in their ability to source new business because of state regulation where the regulators are looking at capital adequacy. So if mortgage insurers are fundamentally suppressed in their ability to write a business, that will eventually express itself inside of our business.", "Suzie Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Got it. Okay, thank you.", "Frank Coyne", "Yeah. And just to follow-up on the mortgage question. We observed that we had a peak in premiums there in the third quarter \u2013 revenue on that premium in the third quarter of 2010 and our second highest quarter with the fourth quarter of 2010. So I want to make sure that I was clear in my earlier answer, expectations filling into the fourth quarter, a little difficult to assess.", "We know we\u2019re doing better than others. We know where our front-in solutions are catching some traction. But it\u2019s hard to tell what mandates that might come out of governments that it could impact any of our customer\u2019s performance. So it is very difficult to project what will happen there in the fourth quarter.", "Mark Anquillare", "And just to clarify I think \u2013 I know Frank made a comment about where we would be in fourth quarter, I think he was referring to it as kind of a year-to-date or full year, not in the quarter itself with regard to growth year-over-year, so just to clarify.", "Eva Huston", "Operator, do we have additional questions?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Boyer.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "You talked about some of the implementations within health care converting to revenue. Are there more large implementations underway or is the line shared of those large implementations now included in the revenue?", "Scott Stephenson", "We\u2019re midstream on all of that, Eric. So there is a lot of it still ahead of us, actually. Just to be clear for those who may be a little bit newer to our story. What we\u2019re referring to here is the work that we do to suppress fraudulent claims flows and we basically have to go through a process of getting our engine or analytic engine hooked up to the customer\u2019s data stores and then go through an ETL process to get their data flowing.", "So that\u2019s the implementation cycle that we\u2019re talking about here. And with some of the large national health plans having sold many of their regions, there\u2019s a stage implementation across their system. So that\u2019s the part of our business that we\u2019re talking about when we talk about these implementation cycles.", "And actually I think relative to the 40-odd implementations we were looking at, what we were reporting on this earlier in the year, we\u2019re not even quite halfway through that. Yes. So there\u2019s a lot more to come.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great. And then can you talk about just, I guess, the positioning of the company today compared to if we were to enter another recession compared to how you were positioned entering the last recession?", "Frank Coyne", "Well, I think one of the strengths of our revenue stream is that it\u2019s well diversified and though we are impacted by this economy, I think we\u2019re stronger today in terms of our diversification than we were before. I think we\u2019ve got assets that are not really impacted by the recession \u2013 more assets that really aren\u2019t impacted by the recession, an example in the health care area and even our 3E acquisition would be a strong contributor in spite of the possible second dip. So I think we\u2019re in a better place.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Riggs.", "Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Scott, a couple of quarters ago you had mentioned looking to or any implementation stage of looking at streamlines and processes around the acquisition integration process, could you just give us some update kind of on where you stand with that?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yeah. I think that we\u2019ve made considerable progress. And that issue exists at multiple levels. One level is trying to harmonize technology platform so that the next acquisition is a little bit more plug-and-play into what we\u2019ve already got. And that has been a theme particularly in the health care vertical. And we\u2019re very encouraged by the progress that we\u2019ve made on that front.", "Some of you will remember that we referenced the fact that there\u2019s a wonderful platform that came along with the Bloodhound acquisition and we\u2019re kind of re-purposing that to serve other parts of our health care business.", "Some of the other pieces of it would represent \u2013 right now, we\u2019re well-along in observing our opportunity to engage in data center consolidation across the entire enterprise. We have designated a function inside of the company which is solely given over to post-acquisition, post-merger integration. And all these things are kind of clicking ahead.", "Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Hi, good morning.", "First, let me say I appreciate the supplement revenue data. It\u2019s very helpful with our analysis. I wanted to ask about in terms of the health care solutions and Decision Analytics, are there different margin characteristics of that business at this stage relative to the overall Decision Analytics product line?", "Mark Anquillare", "Well, I think at this time the answer is, we'll refer to it as strictly the front end, is experiencing some better margins in the backend. And I think that's really a function of disimplementation, as Scott was highlighting before. On the backend, we need to make sure we're integrated with the inside of our customer so we can get claims and information and pass them back potential fraud instances.", "So, that upfront implementation does take time and does cost us money and does weigh our margins until that customer is up and running. What I will call in steady state, I think you would see margins of both being good nature, high, but probably not at the risk assessment type levels.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay. And then with regard to some of the specialized markets, would you say the same that you need that, same infrastructure and place in order to commend in streamline processing?", "Scott Stephenson", "To a degree, yes. So when I was talking about enterprise level, data center consolidation, that definitely applies where the specialized markets are concerned. But with respect to the applications that are at work, they are distinctive. So, to a degree, yes.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Great. And then the last question is with regard to the compensation increase. So that was primarily in the Q2 and seem to have extended in the Q3. Is that going to sunset for the Q4 or will that continue this quarter?", "Mark Anquillare", "Let me clarify it. Some of those parts, we issue equity on April 1st every year and the way the plan is written is that if you\u2019re age is 62 and you were to leave, you definitely have no shares. So what that does is it causes us every year, every second quarter to expense the cost associated with those equity works for those people who have attained age 62.", "So there's always a spike in second quarter relative to first third or fourth quarters. This year in particular the amount in second quarter is a little more than even last year second quarter. And that\u2019s because of some other people who are now aged 62. The last point, I think, you brought up and I just want to highlight is, once we have that accelerated amount, the cost associated with the equity does go down and has gone down in third quarter and will continue at that lower level into fourth quarter.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Got it. Thank you for the clarification.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Richard Cheever.", "Richard Cheever \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Hey. I'm on the line for Andrew Jeffrey. I just wanted to, I guess, first of all, reiterate my thanks for the additional disclosure. It is a really big help. Can you talk a little bit more about, I guess, the positive mix shift in Decision Analytics and how much of that is being driven by, I guess, the increased contribution by health care and specialized market? And talk maybe a little bit about the sustainability of that mix shift.", "Mark Anquillare", "Sure. Let me just try to take that on. I think you get this in the underlying fundamentals. Mortgage is down in the quarter. We have been effective in trying to cut cost there, but clearly margins there are kind of weighing on the profit margins and DA, Decision Analytics, a little bit. But sending out with this mix shift we're referring to is the health care business is improving and the margins are improving as we discuss. And we talked about cast a few modeling as well as just the typical claim search business, the claims fraud business. As they grow, great scaling opportunity leverage to those businesses.", "So, as we grow the top line, a good chunk of that falls to the bottom and that's what we continue to see. And I will, obviously, as kind of Scott mentioned, the wonderful results in loss quantification has the same (inaudible) scale characteristics.", "So, as we add and continue to grow organically in a very significant way, loss quantification, we continue to invest on business, but there's not a lot of additional cost associated with those new customers and new volumes.", "Richard Cheever \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "As those acquisitions specifically in health care in the specialized markets, as they anniversary, is there some additional lift there as you get past on the integration cost?", "Mark Anquillare", "So I think from an integration perspective, I think that's true inside of Verisk scouts. We are doing quite a bit, as Scott highlighted, to integrate those assets. And we're spending money to make that happen, maybe less sell in the other businesses because I don't think we've been able to, for the most part, pull some cost out as we try to integrate them into what is the Verisk family. But there was a lot of upfront cost there.", "Scott Stephenson", "Were you asking specifically about 2011 accusation, the two and a half year space?", "Richard Cheever \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Right, if there are some additional lifts.", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes. Of those HRP, the integration task is kind of simpler and has the shorter timeframe. Bloodhound as I mentioned before has technology that we are really excited to reuse not just inside the payment integrity, but across the entirety of the health care vertical.", "And that's a large project that we'll continue to bring forward, I think, through the better part of 2012. But we're encouraged by the progress we're making. It's just a big thing to get it done.", "Richard Cheever \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. I appreciate the color.", "Frank Coyne", "Thank you.", "Richard Cheever \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Frank Coyne", "All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today and we appreciate your ongoing support, and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.", "Operator", "This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

My name is [Tequila], and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Verisk Analytics\u2019 First Quarter\u2019s Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Ms. Eva Huston, you may begin.", "Eva F. Huston", "Great, thank you, [Tequila], and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2012 financial results.", "With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Anquillare, our CFO. Following some comments by Frank, Scott, and Mark, highlighting the key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we\u2019ll open the call up for your questions.", "The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in as well for 30 days until June 2, 2012.", "And finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In first quarter 2012, we delivered good performance of almost 11% revenue growth, 17.5% diluted adjusted EPS growth, and strong free cash flow growth. We continued strong performance in our businesses, and we are seeing benefits from our 2012 invoices and the improving performance of our P&C insurance customers.", "In 2011, P&C industry premiums grew 3.6% versus 1.5% percent in 2010. While the 2011 industry premiums don\u2019t figure into our invoices until 2013, we are happy our customers are doing better because that does represent new opportunities for us.", "In the first quarter, our risk assessment revenue grew 5.2%, after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics, reflecting the continued value we are delivering to our customers. In Decision Analytics, we grew revenue almost 17%.", "And our Insurance Solutions and Decision Analytics grew about 11%. Our healthcare solutions continued on the growth trajectory we saw in the last half of 2011, growing revenue over 30% organically in the quarter. And we also were pleased to have the MediConnect team join and look forward to their contributions in the future.", "In mortgage, we continue to see challenges in the market and our revenue declined apples-to-apples. But I would note that we grew our underwriting solutions at a faster pace than the origination market grew.", "Overall, our consolidated organic revenue growth was 7.7%, consistent with the expectations we discussed with you last year, as mortgage continues to weigh on growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 9%. We continue to have conviction around our margin and overall profitability.", "Our EBITDA margin was 45.9% in the quarter, and diluted adjusted EPS growth of 17.5% was along very strong. We remain disciplined about our use of capital and focused on delivering shareholder returns. We were pleased to acquire MediConnect this quarter and put about $350 million of that capital to work to generate returns.", "We also bought $39 million of shares in the quarter as we manage our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan, including acquisitions. We remain consistent in our approach to balancing uses of capital. As I look towards the remainder of 2012, I am excited about all the verticals we face and the teams we have in place to deliver growth from our markets.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to talk about our progress against some of our operational goals.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you, Frank. We have a number of things on our plate that we believe set us up for future growth, both from a sales and technology perspective.", "First on sales, we continue to ensure that we have the best teams facing our customers, and we have made some new hires in that area. We are also ensuring that our holistic solution sets are being sold to decision makers. One of the powerful elements of our organization is solutions that can interoperate. Our competitors typically do not have this advantage. For example, our Verisk Insurance Solutions underwriting team has been in operation for a full quarter now, and we are getting good feedback from customers on this approach.", "On the technology side, we\u2019ve recognized the importance of technology and are continuing to invest behind our platforms, in particular, to deliver better solutions to our customers.", "We\u2019ve talked earlier about the unified healthcare platform, and we are on track for that to be completed in 2013, with a series of interim deliverables. As we mentioned when we talked to you about the MediConnect transaction, that acquisition does not impact this initiative, and we have other investments including our next generation platform for catastrophe models, which many of you saw as a part of our Investor Day.", "And then we have host of new claims tools including mobile tools, which can be used to settle claims via smartphones and tablets, while standing with the customer next to their damaged property, as well as Aerial Sketch, which can be used to calculate the cost of repairing a roof without the timer hazard associated with having to climb onto the roof.", "We remain focused on data and analytics, and recognize that the way they are consumed is tied to evolving technology. The power of marrying our long history of data with forward looking analytics by our customer friendly technology is unparallel.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to talk about our corporate financial results.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Thank you, Scott. As Frank noted, in the first quarter, we delivered 10.7% total revenue growth and 7.7% organic revenue growth. And excluding our historical mortgage business, organic growth for the new quarter was 9%.", "For the first quarter, our Decision Analytics segments revenue continue to lead with 16.9% revenue growth, of which 9.6% was organic and excludes the 2011 acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners, as well as the transferred revenue.", "I want to remind you that beginning 2012, we have transferred revenue related to mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment\u2019s property-specific revenue category into Decision Analytics\u2019 mortgage revenue category to reflect a management reporting change.", "The appraisal tools related to insurance customers will remain in the property-specific underwriting category in Risk Assessment. Because the amount is small, $2.9 million of revenue in the quarter, we have not restated historical numbers, but we\u2019ll provide you with an apples-to-apples comparison. As a final note, we closed the MediConnect deal on March 30, so second quarter 2012 will be the first time its revenue and EBITDA will report in our financial results.", "Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category revenue grew 10.5% in the quarter, all organic. We continue to benefit from the growth in our loss quantification claim tools, with double-digit growth from customers and new solutions. Even after a year of almost 30% growth in 2011, catastrophe modeling solutions continued good growth, due to new customers and expanded use of our models, including out catastrophe bond projects in area in which our market share remains very strong.", "Our insurance fraud claims solutions also continued good growth in the quarter, driven by 2012 invoices for certain solutions. The revenue in mortgage and financial services grew 4.8% as reported in the first quarter and declined 4.1% after adjusting for the transfer of the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment into this revenue category.", "Underwriting tools grew in the quarter ahead of the approximate 5% growth in the origination market. The revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter, as new customers and increased usage by existing customers were not sufficient to offset a large customer whose volumes have been trending down in 2011.", "Our outlook for 2012 from mortgage remains negative, as the current market makes it difficult to predict near term trends for the majority of our solutions, but we have confidence in the long-term value.", "Healthcare continues strong growth 95% in the first quarter and 32.9% organic. Our total growth continues to benefit from the addition of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners in 2012 and starting second quarter 2012 will benefit from the addition of MediConnect.", "Just a reminder for those of you looking at sequential revenue dollars first and second quarters are seasonally lower revenue and margin quarters for our HRP businesses and MediConnect followed a similar seasonal pattern. We are 30 days into our ownership MediConnect and excited about the prospects for the business.", "Our specialized markets revenue grew 9.4% in the quarter from both our supply chain solutions as well as our weather analytics, both of these areas are delivering solid growth today, and we are optimistic about the opportunities to broaden their reach. Examples included repurposing our weather analytics into the insurance market, and building on our capabilities of 3E in conjunction with both internal and external tools to broaden our supply chain offerings.", "Turning to risk assessment, we reported revenue of 3.1% in the quarter and 5.2% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer. Our industry-standard programs grew 6.8% in the quarter reflecting our 2012 invoices in good growth from our premium leakage solutions. As you know, we put up new invoices in December, and begin recognizing the new level of the revenue on January 1, and throughout the year.", "I will note that we had about $1 million of revenue in the quarter related to the license fee which is non-recurring. Our property specific revenue as reported declined 5.6%, but excluding the transfer grew 2.8%, as new sales and higher volumes from certain customers offset (inaudible). ", "Our 2011 industry premium will not affect our invoices until 2013, as Frank noted, it is nice to see the commercial premiums for 2011 almost 4.4% to the positive versus the decline of 1.6% in 2010.", "EBITDA for the first quarter was $159.2 million, as outlined in table three of our press release, the increase 14.5% for the quarter and our EBITDA margins was 45.9%, an increase versus the 44.4% in first quarter of 2011, and 45% in fourth quarter of 2011, it\u2019s nice to see the scale in the margins. Please remember, as you model that our invoice increases and risk assessment comes through on January 1.", "But our annual salary increases come through in April. So annual salary increases will be effective in the second quarter, and the increased corporate expenses by about $3.3 million per quarter beginning in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect incremental cost of about $4.7 million in second quarter related to our April 2012 equity loss, primarily resulting from an accelerated vesting upon obtainment of eligible retirement age by some employees.", "About 70% or 75% of this option impact will be seen in this assessment. Finally, we do not anticipate much impact in 2012 margins resulting from the MediConnect acquisition, however because of the seasonality of its revenue MediConnect margins in second quarter are lower than the full year margins and we would expect to see an impact when the revenue and EBITDA are first reported in next quarter. In the quarter, our risk assessment margins were 55.1%versus 52.8% in first quarter 2011.", "We benefited by about 1.4% on the margins due to the lower pension costs, on February 29, we froze our pension plan and in early April funded $73 million, bringing it closer to fully funded which will limit the growth in that expense going forward.", "Our business continues to show scalable profitability, while we continue to invest in developing new solutions. The margin in Decision Analytics was 39.3% in the first quarter 2012 versus 37.7% in first quarter 2011, and 40.7% in fourth quarter of 2011.", "Improvement in the underlying margins of several of our businesses including healthcare, as they scaled the revenue benefited us in the quarter partially offset by the adverse impact from the mortgage business. We also capitalized a few more dollars in this quarter, some relating to the technology initiatives that Scott had mentioned.", "Our interest expense was up $1.6 million versus fourth quarter 2011, as the increased interest expense associated with our bond offering in December was fully reflected in the first quarter. We carried excess cash in most of the quarter from the bond offering and our free cash flow. But use them to fund part the MediConnect transaction bringing our cash balance closer to normal levels at $115 million at quarter end.", "We ended first quarter with total debt of $1.2 billion, including $125 million drawn for the MediConnect acquisition, and a pro forma debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.9% times.", "In early April, we drew an additional $75 million for our pension funding leaving us at about our long-term target capital structure of two times debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis. Our reported effective tax rate is 39.4% for the quarter. For 2012, we are expecting rate in line with our historical rate of approximately 40%.", "Coming down to the net income line, we\u2019re focused on adjusted net income and non-GAAP measure, which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition related amortization expense less the income tax effect on that amortization.", "Our adjusted net income increased 12.4% to $79.8 million for the quarter, and adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.47, an increase of 17.5%. The average diluted share count was $171.4 million in the quarter, and on March 31, 2012 our diluted share count was $171.9 million shares.", "In the quarter, we purchased about 900,000 shares for approximately $39 million. At quarter end, we had about $216 million left under our authorization. Our approach to share repurchase remained focused on limiting dilution and only going forward, when we believe we can purchase, we can deliver appropriate IRRs and not crowd out our acquisitions. Our share repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs of over 25%.", "Turning to the balance sheet; as of March 31, our cash and cash equivalents were about $115 million; total debt, both short-term and long-term totaled just north of $1.2 billion on March 31, reflecting the debt borrowed to fund the MediConnect closing on March 30, and was about $1.3 million after our pension funding in early April.", "Post MediConnect and pension funding, our debt capacity is about $600 will continue to grow free cash flow. As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of two time debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities, particularly on the acquisition front. With that debt capacity available, we continue to look for the right opportunities.", "Free cash flow in first quarter 2012, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $173.7 million, an increase of $46.8 million or 36.9% first quarter of 2011.", "Free cash flow grew faster than EBITDA bolstered by the timing of cash interest payments on our bonds to our certain customers paying invoices in first quarter this year, then paid in second quarter last year.", "Our capital expenditures were 4.6% of revenue, we continue our strong free cash flow conversion of EBITDA, which was 109.1% in first quarter 2012, reflecting the typical first quarter pattern in which a good portion of our customers pay their full year quarterly bill in advance. Overall, our business is performing well. We have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and we\u2019re continuing to invest in future.", "With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo, LLC", "The Insurance vertical within your Decision Analytics business, I think it was the first quarter since you\u2019ve been public where you didn\u2019t have your quarterly reported growth, can you help us understand the dynamics of going along within that segment, and when you think the year-over-year organic growth rate should reaccelerate in the drivers of that?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yeah, this is Mark. I appreciate the question, couple of things to note, first of all as you think about the verticals, a relative to fourth quarter of 2011 severe storms, and the seasonal weather patterns were pretty harsh in 2011.", "So there was a lot of storm activity that did help us specifically on the claim side of things. We are kind of now into a normal or lower time of year with regard to the storms and those claims that are associated with severe weather. The other thing that typically happens at year-end or there so, I will call it more of the one-time project type work that typically falls inside of our catastrophe modeling solutions and those projects, which are usually completed for and focused on year-end we\u2019re also helping and historically helped the latter part of the year specifically for the quarter.", "So those are a couple of dimensions that helps what is fourth quarter. I think we feel good about first quarter, where we were but to answer your specific question, it was a little bit about well over topic.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo, LLC", "Okay, great. And then, I think you said you benefited in risk assessment, the revenue growth by $1 million for non-recurring benefit. I didn\u2019t catch what that was from. Could you just drill that again?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure. Some of the insurance programs are licensed by vendors. So they incorporate our programs in their solutions. Their software solutions, as an example like Policy Admin Solutions and we had in most part fee that was paid in first quarter. That is a normal fees but it\u2019s a non-recurring type of item in the first quarter.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo, LLC", "Okay. And then just with the MediConnect, could you help us better understand the ramp there, we\u2019re looking at more like a 30% first half or 70% the back half for revenue and EBITDA?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "I think that\u2019s a good approximation. It\u2019s a little bit tough to have that level of visibility, but we continue to believe that\u2019s about right.", "Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo, LLC", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Good morning.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Good morning.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Frank, you highlighted a sharp acceleration in direct written premium growth at your P&C customers in 2011 that will impact your own Risk Assessment revenue growth in 2013. Given that acceleration in direct written premium growth how you\u2019re thinking about pricing \u2013 how you\u2019re thinking about pricing for 2013 and can you get into the bottom of your long-term organic target range of 10% to 12% with that pickup in direct written premium?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Well first on the pricing, we look at our pricing every year based on enhanced value that we bring to our customers plus their actual growth for the year that we have in reports that they submit. So it\u2019s too early for me to really applying on what our pricing might be for 2013. But as you saw with our \u2013 on the second part of your question, I mean we\u2019re optimistic because we are you know we add that wind at our face now for few years and now it\u2019s turning, so it certainly gives us more flexibility.", "And on the second part of your question, I\u2019m pleased that extra mortgage we had a 9% organic revenue growth for the quarter and that\u2019s a good sign and I like the assets that we have and I like the potential that we have for organic growth going forward. So, we still hold on to our aspirational targets.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc", "We\u2019ll put in other way is there any reason to believe that you wouldn\u2019t have at least CPI type pricing in 2013 in the risk assessment business?", "Frank J. Coyne", "You know, as I said I really it will be premature for me to talk about pricing, but that\u2019s a reasonable assumption.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "All right, you\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Raymond James.", "William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Good morning everyone.", "Eva F. Huston", "Hi.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Hi, good morning.", "William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "A couple of questions for the \u2013 the first is in 2010 and in 2011, the second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was the trough for the year and then third and fourth quarter margins were at or above the first quarter margin levels, and would it be reasonable to assume that pattern repeats in 2012?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Bill, thank you. Let me just kind of recap a little bit what you\u2019re trying to get to there are two things that affect us in the second quarter. First of all, relative to first, we do have salary increases coming through, those salary increases as I mentioned is about $3.3 million. That's an item that we\u2019ll continue obviously into second, third and fourth, so that\u2019s something kind of model through the year. ", "William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "The vote of on equity awards that were just granted in April because of the nature of accelerated vesting on determined age; that does cause a bit of a one-time item that affects second quarter. So a, the 2012 equity awards are bigger than the 2009, that\u2019s kind of rolling off and these are rolling. So we talked about the 4.7, but a good majority of that 4.7 relates to this accelerated vesting. So that item will affect second quarter and then it will go away for the third and fourth very similar to last year or so.", "William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "To that point those are couple dimensions along the MediConnect that I mentioned that should probably cause a little bit of trough in the second quarter as you noted.", "William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Gotcha, okay and then another question for you would be, you had very impressive growth in the Xactware segment 2011, over 20% and it\u2019s still delivering strong growth against that. And, can you talk a little bit about the new products and new customers in that segment that you\u2019re targeting, and what kind of growth you think you can deliver from the 10% level?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yeah, this is Scott, Bill. There is quite a few things that we\u2019re doing on the Xactware in front of you that rise to the top of the level would be, we\u2019re very excited about the content side of the business. You may know that Xactware historically has been about estimating the value of the structure, but something on the order of 40% of the value overall is in the contents. And the use of automated tools for estimating contents really has not emerged yet fully in the same way that it has on the structural side. And so, we\u2019re very excited about that.", "Second thing is, the business is finding its way into overseas markets. We sort of have our launching pad into Continental Europe, pretty well established now in the UK and via existing customer relationships, we\u2019re actually reaching over there. And it\u2019s going to be a long march, but we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing.", "Third thing is, the tools that we use on the insurance side are also useful in the OREO market where the property owner has to keep track of what a cost to maintain a property that\u2019s moved into OREO status. And so, we\u2019ve actually just introduced a line of solutions into that marketplace, and again it\u2019s kind of early days, but we\u2019re encouraged about that. And then, I think you know that the kind of the syncopation inside of the business today is that, our tools are now being used for the adjusting of well over 80% of all residential claims.", "On the underwriting side, for ITV calculations our share is not that high, but it continues to go up and carriers find it very compelling to think about using the same analytic engine and same dataset for both underwriting the policy on the front end and adjusting the claims on the back end.", "So we find that the market continues to come to us on that approach. So, a variety of things that are working side of the business, and we do remain optimistic about the growth potential for the business over longer periods of time.", "There were some exciting things that happened in 2011 that contributed to that 30% plus growth rate, some very large customers coming over into our column. And so, there were something a little bit extraordinary about 2011, but we do remain very optimistic about the business.", "William Warmington \u2013 Raymond James", "Excellent. Thank you for the insight.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Mcveigh with Macquarie. ", "Kevin Mcveigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Thank you. Wonder, if you give a sense of how much acquisitions impacted the margins in Q1?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I will tell you. We have not spent a lot of time on it, because I don\u2019t think it was much of an impact. Remember we\u2019ve always been talking about the acquisitions of [property] in 3E, because they were purchased in December of 2010. So now as we go forward, 1Q '12, 1Q '11, we have an apples-to-apples and the combination of the newer acquisitions, MediConnect and HRP not affect the margins to bigger degree.", "Eva F. Huston", "Yeah, I think in Decision Analytics, it\u2019s about 60 basis points.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yeah, in just DA.", "Kevin Mcveigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Great, thank you. And then, just as kind of the P&C market starts to firm a little bit, does that impact the selling process at all in terms of the type of product, your clients are looking at and just any derivative impact on the business from that?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Yeah, it does. It frees up opportunities for our customers to look at additional products of ours that they have and interest in, but didn\u2019t have budget for. And the selling cycle shortened somewhat when our customers are growing.", "Kevin Mcveigh \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Riggs with William Blair.", "Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair & Company, L.L.C.", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s kind of an extension of the last line of question and you\u2019ve highlighted roughly $1 billion opportunity, additional opportunity in the P&C space. What are going to be the key drivers to seizing on that opportunity? Have you made any adjustments in terms of your sales force and in terms of driving that cross selling, and maybe where are you doing? Feel like you\u2019re doing a good job of pursuing that and where is there still some work to be done? Thanks.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Yeah, thank you. That\u2019s something we spend a lot of time on. One thing I would point to is you may have noticed that last year we reorganized some of our P&C assets. We pulled assets from actually five different operating units to create various underwriting. And part of the purpose of doing that is to present a more unified coherent face to our customers in the underwriting space.", "If you look at our position in the P&C marketplace overall and you think about the different disciplines that are at work there, we\u2019re very, very strong with respect to rate making and all of the associated process that goes on in front of the regulators. We\u2019re very strong in the claims function; we\u2019re very strong in catastrophe modeling.", "In the underwriting discipline, where a presence of the relative strength of our competitive position is not as great and so one of the things that we\u2019re emphasizing is just that and so the reorganization, the naming of a talented executive to run that business for us. All of that really reflects our ambition to become bigger, stronger in the underwriting function and it\u2019s early days, but we do think that this new approach is beginning to yield what we\u2019re hoping it would. ", "Another comment would be that, we\u2019re just very focused on the cross-selling opportunity and so we\u2019ve done what we have done for sometime and have to really make sure that account management is a very strong function for us and basically representing the full range of solutions that we have for our carrier customers. And those are the kinds of things that we do, there is nothing, I mean the reorganization was obviously a point of time thing, but a lot of it is just as long steady approach presenting all of our capabilities to the customer base and being a good partner. ", "Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair & Company, L.L.C.", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.", "Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi. The pro forma financials with MediConnect in spite of the revenue growth in Q1 was about 67%. Is there anything unusual there that would cause it to be so high and should we expect this rate of growth for the rest of the year?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So, Suzanne, this is Mark. I appreciate the question. The first quarter, as we said, there is a little bit of seasonality to it. When we talked about seasonality at year-end, year-end also kind of rolls into January. So there is a little bit of positive wind that still flows through.", "I think that we are still comfortable with the discussion we had. I don\u2019t know if we have any optimism about second quarter or view too much into what we saw in the first quarter. So, hopefully it\u2019s a little bit of a positive, but I would not change anything we described relative to the Mediclaim call where we talked about growth consistent with the past.", "Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, the organic growth rate in specialized markets have been very volatile, what do you think is a normalized growth rate for that business?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Well, let me just describe. Last year, well, we did run into, inside of the specialized was government and budgetary constraints, but that caused a little bit of a downturn towards the end of the year as government kind of shutdown for a piece. The other thing that I will remind you is that we want a very sizable contract. It grows our contract (inaudible) so we had that growing very quickly until we got to a point where we had this growth on that contract.", "So you saw last year towards the quarter, the fact that the contract did come, of course through the full year. I think what you\u2019re seeing now in first quarter, feels like a reasonable growth rate and I think we\u2019ve (inaudible) and I would call normalized, I think we found some consistency.", "Frank J. Coyne", "The climate and science part of our business is actually starting to find a little bit more traction in the commercial markets, which should overtime both get bigger as a percentage of the total and be somewhat steadier with respect to the revenue profile.", "Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, just one final question on the mortgage business. What are you expecting as far as declines for the rest of the year, and how far along is the customer that you singled out, just in terms of winding down the business?", "Frank J. Coyne", "So let me describe. I think what we said during the year-end call is that we can see the mortgage business declining similar to what we saw in the quarter, which was a 7% decline. We said we could see the negative aspect of the market being to that level throughout the course of '12. And to your point, I mean, what we\u2019re seeing is our business on the front end, just would relate to the underwriting side of things, growing faster (inaudible) build on the customers and that is growing faster than mortgage relation bonds as a whole, but, unfortunately the one customer trending down is more than offsetting some of that good news that we\u2019re seeing on the existing customers. So we think we are well positioned. I think we remain very optimistic for the future because we are improving our position inside the market, but it\u2019s a challenging one at this point.", "Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So I guess, just to clarify on that customer that\u2019s trending down, are you kind of getting close to the tail end of that or will that continue for the foreseeable future?", "Frank J. Coyne", "It\u2019s going to continue through third quarter.", "Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. ", "Eva F. Huston", "Okay.", "Suzanne Stein \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Huang with UBS. ", "Jennifer Huang \u2013 UBS", "Thank you. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about the healthcare business, the growth was obviously very strong there. I was just wondering, how much of that do you think, maybe attributable to your efforts to integrate the healthcare platforms into just one? And then, maybe as a follow-up, I think you guys have mentioned investments in the integration process of about $10 million over the course of two years. Maybe you can quantify how much of that you saw in the first quarter or how much of that impacted the EBTIDA margins?", "Scott G. Stephenson ", "Yeah, let me take the first part of that, this is Scott, as it relates to healthcare. We are working hard on integration. I just would like everybody to understand that there are actually two different forms of integrations that are now working inside of what we\u2019re doing in healthcare. The first is that we\u2019re trying to unify the data analytic platform, off of which the individual solutions are built.", "And that has to do with coming up with normalized data models and creating a data warehouse structure that can serve all of the different aspects of what we do, whether it\u2019s trying to add value to claims or it\u2019s trying to engage in risk adjusting, et cetera. So that\u2019s one thing which is ongoing. I mentioned earlier that that\u2019s a project, which continues through 2013 and that will hopefully and should and we plan for it to work to the benefit of all of the different sets of solutions that we provide into the marketplace.", "There is the second integration, which we\u2019re now undertaking, which is related to the MediConnect acquisition and basically there is, and we are going to feature in a way that we operate, a strong linkage between three things that we do. One is chart retrieval and abstraction, which is what MediConnect does, HEDIS reporting, which we already do, and risk adjusting on behalf of plans that are seeking Medicare reimbursements.", "Those three businesses actually have a lot of, logically relate strongly one to the other. And so, we are at work even now to try to pull those operationally together so that we can present yet more integrated and streamline solutions to our customers. I guess what I want to emphasis with respect to result is that we are just in the process of integrating right now. So I would not really attribute anything in our first quarter 2012 healthcare results to the integration work that we\u2019re doing. ", "On your second question, which is the investing we\u2019re doing to achieve these new platforms. There\u2019s actually two major streams of investment, which are going on. One is the unified platform in healthcare, and the other is the next generation platform supporting our catastrophe models, and that\u2019s the number that you\u2019ve heard us reference before. It\u2019s not all just been healthcare.", "Jennifer Huang \u2013 UBS", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "You\u2019re welcome. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mark, the cash flow from operations was up almost or above 30% year-over-year. It seem like some of that was related to a reduction in working capital. I was wondering how sustainable that is? ", "Mark V. Anquillare ", "Sure, well, thanks for the question. We did have very good first quarter, so two things or a few things that factored into it. First of all, let me remind you, in first quarter of last year, we talked about a refresh of our technology environment here in New Jersey City and that was a little bit about periodic thing. So we have a drop in CapEx in first quarter 2012 relative to 2011, so that helped us.", "The other things that, we highlight or want to highlight is that the semi-annual aspect of bond interest did not run through the P&L in the first quarter, so that helped us sort of on catch up in second quarter, so that\u2019s about I think about $6 million. And the rest of it, I will call out maybe about $7 million, $8 million where we can point to customers who seem to be paying in first quarter of this year and paid may be in second quarter last year. ", "So when I normalize all that, I think we\u2019re still seeing free cash flow growth about 20% which is very strong, very positive, since we have everyone in the call, I do want to remind you that second quarter we did make this $72 million funding of the pension for that $72 million will have to just normalize next quarter that will be considered in operating cash flow and reduce it, but the underlying trend in underlying seems quite positive and we\u2019re pleased with the first quarter results there.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group", "Okay, thank you and then Scott just for a clarification attribution perspective, the HEDIS reporting, the charting and the risk adjustment solutions that you described earlier, how were those going to be categorized between analytics and assessment? ", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, we\u2019re going to have to look at that, I think that \u2013 structure needs to follow function and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve actually sorted that out, I mean the HEDIS is inside of enterprise analytics today, this is our own structure and then the other piece the Medicare is revenue integrity but will, we\u2019re working first on the organizational integration of those so we will see. ", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group", "Okay, thanks for taking my question.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Welcome", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Eva F. Huston", "Great.", "Frank J. Coyne", "All right. Well, thank you for joining us on our first quarter results, and we look forward to speaking with you again and we continue to thank you for your support.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today.  And information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.", "Frank Coyne", "Thank you, Eva, and good morning.  In second quarter 2012, we delivered good performance of 14% total revenue growth and almost 15% diluted adjusted EPS growth.  We continued strong performance from our Healthcare business and good performance from our insurance businesses and our emerging businesses in specialized markets.", "In the second quarter our risk adjustment revenue grew 4.9% after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics beginning in 2012.  This growth is a continuation of what you saw in the first quarter and evidence of our sticky customer relationship based on the recognizable value we bring.", "In Decision Analytics, we grew revenue almost 23% and our insurance solutions in Decision Analytics grew about 9%, a very solid rate given the lower storm activity versus last year.", "Our Healthcare solutions continued on the organic growth we have seen in the past few quarters growing revenue nearing 37% organically in the quarter.  Our total Healthcare revenue growth was over 160% bolstered by the contributions MediConnect has made to our second quarter performance.", "In Mortgage, we continue to see challenges in the market and our revenue declined due to the declining items of forensic review, but I would note that we continue to grow our underwriting solutions at a faster pace than the 2Q estimates for the origination market.", "Overall, our consolidated organic revenue growth was 6.4% as we saw both a lighter quarter per storm activity and mortgage continue to weigh on growth.  Excluding all historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 8.4%.  Profitability remained strong with an EBITDA margin of 43.9% in the quarter.", "We remain disciplined of our use of capital and are focused on delivering shareholder returns.  We brought $68 million of shares in the quarter as we mange our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan.  We continue to be active in looking at M&A but also continue to maintain our discipline, focusing on assets with a true strategic fit, strong financial model and appropriate value in relation to future growth.", "The first half of 2012 has been solid and met expectations overall.  I remain confident that behind the numbers we are doing the right things to position our business for future growth driven by delivering quality solutions to our customers.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Scott to give you details about our progress in healthcare and other parts of the business.", "Scott Stephenson", "Thank you, Frank.  I'm going to briefly update you on development in several of our business with an emphasis on innovations aimed at our customers' emerging needs and ways in which we are becoming more integral to their operation.", "First, in the Healthcare vertical three items, the unified platform initiatives is proceeding in the first phase of integrating our payment integrity businesses has been largely completed.  We are one month into hosting of large customer on the platform and then our teams are pleased with the results to-date.  The efficacy of our real-time edits are increasing materially inside the new platform.  In the next phase, we will leave our enterprise analytic solution into the platform as we also transition more customers to the platform.  We are pleased to be meeting important milestones on time as we steam towards 2013 completion of the project.", "Next, we are finding great synergy between our revenue integrity business and MediConnect Business.  We have been pitching business jointly and have been energized by the level of wins coming from the combined skill set.", "And third, we are finding great synergy between our healthcare analytics and the P&C world.  Working with the group of PNC carriers, we have now processed $15 billion of work comp claims in order to suppress fraudulent and wasteful ones.  We are only getting started and the early result hold great promise.", "In connection with all the positive momentum we are excited to have recently name Joel Portice as the new President of Verisk Health.  Joel had been running our payment accuracy division, which is one of our most highly performing, and where his leadership had led us to considerably higher growth in margin as well as the integration of the unified platform I mentioned earlier.  We extend the best wishes as Michael Coyne, our prior president moves on to an emergent health and traumatic company.", "In a different vertical, I want to highlight some work we have been dealing with our weather and analytics tool as they related to insurers.  In late 2011, we announced a solution called AER Respond, which picks our weather data and overlays it on an insurance policy portfolio when a large weather event occurs in order to give them a better estimate, of both how to deploy their resources as well as what type and volume of claims to expect.", "We have recently been successful in selling this solution to several top tier insurers and have begun to integrate this tool into our Xactimate claims estimating tool and we are excited about this and the general future of repurposing our weather analytics in the commercial uses for insurers as well as into other domains such as the supply chain.", "The general themes of innovation and repurposing of our intellectual property are very alive across all parts of Verisk and they will continue to be a major part of our growth story going forward.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results.", "Mark Anquillare", "Thank Scott.  You have put some of the exciting things that are going on in our business and I will share some of the numbers that was a result of those efforts.", "In the second quarter, we delivered 14% total revenue growth and 6.4% organic revenue growth.  Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic growth in the quarter was 8.4%.  For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue continued to lead with 22.6% revenue growth of which 7.6% was organic excluding the 2011 acquisitions for Bloodhound and HRP, which is Health Risk Partners and the 2012 acquisition of MediConnect, as well as the transferred revenue for the mortgage appraisal tool.", "As a reminder in 2012, we have transferred revenue related to the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment's property specific revenue category into Decision Analytics' mortgage and financial services revenue category to reflect a management reporting change.", "We will continue to provide you with visibility into the apples versus apples comparisons throughout 2012.", "Within the Decision Analytics our insurance category grew 8.8% in the second quarter for organic.  We continued on double digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions as we continued to gain customers and also performed well on the catastrophe related products focused on the capital markets.  We have been the model of record for all catastrophe bonds issued in 2012.", "We also experienced strong subscription revenue from our loss quantification solutions, but more moderate growth due to decreased transactional revenue resulting from decreased storm activity in the second quarter of 2012 versus the same period in 2011.", "Claim solutions delivered respectable growth.  I'll note that our acquisition of Aspect Loss Prevention in July of 2012 is under the leadership of our pro-claims and crime analytics group, and we reported in the insurance revenue category within Decision Analytics.  The revenue in mortgage and financial services declined 1% as reported in the second quarter and declined 9.9% after adjusting for the transfer of new mortgage appraisal tools from risk assessment into this revenue category.", "Underwriting tools grew nicely in the quarter and continued to outpace growth in origination markets.  Corporate revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter as expected offsetting that growth.  Our outlook for 2012 for mortgage remains negative as the mortgage markets continues to make it difficult to predict near-term trend for the majority of our solutions, but we remain confident in the long-term value and our relationships with the financial institutions that buy our tools.", "Healthcare continued strong growth, 160.7% for the second quarter and 36.7% organically, and healthcare organic growth year-to-date has been 34.8%.  Our total growth continues to benefit from the addition of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners, as well as the addition of MediConnect in the second quarter.", "Just as a reminder for those of you who are looking at sequential revenue dollars, Q1 and Q2 are seasonally lower revenue and margin quarters for our revenue integrity business.  And MediConnect follows a similar seasonal pattern.  Additionally, starting in third quarter 2012, both the acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners will become a part of our calculation of organic growth.", "Our specialized markets grew 8.7% in the second quarter, with growth from both our supply chain solutions as well as in weather analytics.  Both of these areas are delivering solid growth today, and we are optimistic about the opportunities to broaden their reach.", "Scott gave you an example of traction we're getting with insurance on our weather analytics and we're actively taking our 3D assets, in addition to our stream event modeling asset, in developing broader strategies around that to serve supply chain.", "In Risk Assessment, we reported revenue growth of 2.6% in the quarter, and 4.9% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer we discussed earlier.  Our industry standard program 6.1% in the quarter reflecting our 2012 invoices and strong growth in our premium leakage solution.  If you're looking at sequential revenue growth please note remember 2000, $1 million of license revenue was called out in first quarter that was non-recurring.", "Our property specific revenue growth, which reported declines of 7.3%, but excluding the transfer grew 1.8%, as new sales and higher volumes from certain customers offset decline from others and the appraisable solutions grew further growth also.", "EBITDA for the second quarter was $163.8 million as outlined in table 3 of our press release.  EBIDTA increased 14% for the quarter and our EBIDTA margin was 43.9% remaining consistent with our margins in the second quarter of 2011.  Although actually up if you take into account the $3.0 million benefit of the earn-out liability reduction in 2011, and the greater impact on margin of a full quarter of acquisition they are seasonally lower in the second quarter of 2012.  Ex-acquisitions the second quarter of 2012 margins would have been 44.9%.", "As reported we're down slightly from the 45.9% in the first quarter 2012 due primarily to our annual salary increases from April 1st, and the incremental cost related to April 2012 equity work, and associated accelerated vesting on the payment of eligible retirement age by some employees.", "In the quarter our risk assessment margins were 52.8% versus 48.6% in second quarter of 2011.  We benefited by about 2% on the margin due to lower pension costs related to freeze of plan in February.  Also in April, we funded $72 million into the pension bringing it closer to fully funded.", "Our business continues to show scaled up profitability, but we also to continue to invest in developing new solutions.", "The margin in Decision Analytics was 38.3% in second quarter 2012 versus 40.4% in second quarter of 2011, and 39.3% in first quarter 2012.  In second quarter 2011, we had the benefit to the margin from the reduction in earn out liability of $3.4 million.  Excluding the benefit of that reduction, the margin in that period was 38.6%.  In second quarter 2012, ex-acquisitions EBITDA margin will exceed 39%.", "Our interest expense was up $2.5 million versus second quarter 2011 based on higher debt balance related to our acquisitions.  We ended the second quarter with total debt of $1.3 billion including the $150 million drawn under our $725 million revolver.  Our pro forma debt to EBIDTA ratio as of June 30th was 1.9 times.", "Our reported effective tax rate was 39.5% for the quarter, which we expect to continue for the rest of 2012.", "Coming down to the net income line, we focused on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition related amortization expense, less the income tax effects on that amortization.", "Our adjusted net income increased 13.7% to $80.6 million for the quarter and adjusted EPS on its fully diluted basis was $0.47, an increase of 14.6%.  The average diluted share count was 171.9 million shares in the quarter and on March 31, 2012, our diluted share count was 171.3 million shares.", "In the quarter, we purchased approximately 1.4 million shares for about $68 million.  At quarter end we had about $200 million left under our authorization.  Our approach to share repurchases remained focused on limiting dilution and only going beyond that when we believe the share repurchase will deliver appropriate internal rates of return and not crowd out acquisitions.  Our share repurchase program has been successful to date generalized annualized IRRs over 25%.", "Turning to the balance sheet.  As of June 30, our cash and cash equivalents were about $97 million.  Total debt both short-term and long-term totaled $1.3 billion at June 30 reflecting debt borrowed that fund the MediConnect acquisition which closed on March 30, and after our pension funding of $72 million April.", "Post MediConnect and pension funding, our debt capacity is about $650 million and will continue to grow with our EBIDTA and free cash flow.  As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go beyond our long-term target of 2 times debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities, particularly on the acquisition side.  With that debt capacity available, we continue to look for the right opportunities.", "Free cash from the first half of 2012, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was a $149.4 million, a decrease of about $3.3 million or 2.2% versus the first half of 2011.  This decline was principally due to the funding of our pension which we have mentioned earlier.  Excluding the impact of our pension funding net of tax benefit and timing (inaudible) and other items or free cash was about 18% to the positive.", "Our capital expenditures were 5.3% of revenue for six months ended June 30, 2012.  Free cash flow represented 46.2% of EBITDA in the first six months of 2012 reflecting a reduced conversionary due to the $72 million pension funding partially offset by the tax benefit associated with that.", "Overall, our business is performing well, and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple vertical and we continue to invest for the future. ", "With that, I will ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kelly Flynn with Credit Suisse.", "Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse", "Great.  Thanks for taking my question first.  So my question relates to MediConnect and also Bloodhound and HRP.  Can you give us more specific sense of what revenue MediConnect contributed to the business in the second quarter?  And then also it would be helpful if you could tell us what the year-over-year growth rates were for both MediConnect as well as the Bloodhound and HRP businesses in the second quarter so we can try to figure out hopefully what impact the HRP and Bloodhound might have when they roll into organic?  Thanks.", "Mark Anquillare", "Well, I think what we have seen is nice and solid growth in the standpoint of all of our healthcare acquisitions.  We grew in double digits across the board in the first half of 2012 and MediConnect showed strength.  As we described at the time of the call on MediConnect, there is a second half seasonal aspect to MediConnect similar to our Health Risk Partners business in that anywhere from 50% for HRP and maybe as much as 70% from MediConnect is more weighted towards the second half.  So (inaudible) that gives you a little bit more visibility into where we are.", "Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse", "Well, I guess the thing is that I mean the health care business is growing over 30% organically.  So, I mean when you say double digit that could be anywhere from you know 10 to 30 for these acquisitions.  So, I mean could you give any more help on that?  are we talking -- do you think basically when HRP and Bloodhound roll into the organic base, is it likely to have a significant positive impact on the organic growth or should we think about their growth rate is being closer to the corporate organic rate at this point?", "Mark Anquillare", "Sure, let me try to give up a little bit more on that.  I think there is two things that you consider and just remember that I was to look back from the standpoint of healthcare, third quarter we did about $30 million last year and then we had a big step into fourth quarter we did about $38 million.  So there is a tougher comp but we feel very good about the continuation of strong organic growth and I think it come into the corporate growth rate there growing faster than the corporate organic growth rate, and that should provide the lift.", "Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse - Analyst", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rayna Kumar with Evercore Partners.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners", "Good morning, I am calling in fro David Togut.  Can you please talk about the specific factor that throughout the deterioration of mortgage results in the second quarter and do you expect these factors to persist during the next 18 months?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yeah, this is Scott, I will take that.  I mean, as Mark said before, when you think about the different parts of our business, the tools that we sell for purposes of supporting originations were up strongly.  And so, the difference in result is a function of the forensic and analysis we do of the loans that are gone bad.  And what we are seeing is a variety of movements inside the customer base where there are some customers that have ramped up their volumes but there had been others that have actually ramped down their volume substantially, just particularly in the mortgage insurance world, and that's just a function of market condition in that world.  So, that's a trend that we think we'll continue to work its way out in 2012.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners", "Okay.  And just a follow-up to the previous question, do you think high 30% organic revenue growth in the healthcare vertical is sustainable, and if so why?", "Mark Anquillare", "I think I tried to answer that before, I mean, I think we feel very good about healthcare.  The comps become more challenging as we get towards the end of year.  So we still feel very good about the strong double-digit growth.  And to extent that we get a little bit more refined there, I think we've been winning customers, but I don't know if we have a very specific view lines dollar and percent growth.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.", "Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo", "How much of an impact this, the lower storm activity have on the insurance growth rate within Decision Analytics on the quarter?", "Scott Stephenson", "It's a little bit difficult to parse because what happens inside of our contracts is this.  If we have a customer who has exceeded their minimums and then we start to just basically charge on a transactional basis.  In very large parts, it will come to us and we'll renegotiate a higher minimum.  So, it's tough to do a direct comparison.  But let me just at least give you this.  It was definitely a drag in the tune of about 20 bps in the second quarter on overall growth.  I think that's the one way we kind of think about it.", "So, I hope that gives you some clarity.  And what we're seeing which is obviously, may be fleeting but we've seen storm activity in July start to return to normal, which I think bodes well, I mean, like any insurance cycle and insurance trends I mean, things are up and down.  And I think we saw a very high activity in 2011.  We've seen unusually low activity in the first half of '12 and you would think things would start to return to normal.", "Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo", "So, how should we think about then that insurance piece of the Decision Analytics business going forward?  Is that really like a high single-digit revenue grower with upside to that due to whatever has happened with this storm activity?", "Scott Stephenson", "I just need to clarify, are you talking about insurance as a whole or you're talking about the insurance aspects of Decisions Analytics please?", "Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo", "Within Decision Analytics?", "Scott Stephenson", "I think we continue to feel very strong growth there is possible.  I mean, I -- we tell you that from the standpoint of insurance inside of DA, we do look at and I will just quickly digress.", "When, we think about insurance I mean we're servicing a broad set of customers that is a combination of those customers from a risk assessment perspective and we try to cross-sell into Decision Analytics.  So, across the board, I think we do feel that that combined is a kind of high single-digit growth.  But we do have a view that Decision Analytics where most of that growth is going to be.  And we continue to feel strong about the opportunities there both in the second half of the year, as well as into the future.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from Bill Warmington with Raymond James.", "Bill Warmington - Raymond James", "I want to ask on the mortgage business.  When you saw the cross over point was going to come, when the originations business begins to outgrow the forensic piece and also, if you could remind us again what the mix is between the two businesses?", "Mark Anquillare", "Well, we remained cautions about mortgage to the full year.  I think we have said that if we exclude that revenue trends, so we talked about we are down about 7%.  I think we mentioned early on the year that that had been and continues to be our forecast of full year.", "There is a customer that we described for most part that starts to normalize in fourth quarter.  But just given the uncertainty inside that market and also the movement in originations which have been strong in the second quarter and subsequently in the future the risk become a little bit cautious about giving too much optimism inside of mortgage for the remainder of the year.", "Bill Warmington - Raymond James", "", "Okay.  How about the mix, if you can recall it was like two thirds forensic and third origination but that maybe dated now?", "Mark Anquillare", "Its now about 55% on the backend, it is a little bit greater than that 50% on the year-to-date perspective and that is obviously down from what it was because the forensic has been dropping and the front end has been increasing.", "Bill Warmington - Raymond James", "Okay.  And then, I wanted to ask also, if you could give some additional color on how you are integrating MediConnect into revenue integrity and also for the HEDIS with enterprise analytics?", "Frank Coyne", "Yeah, good.  So, the HEDIS part of our business actually formally reports into the MediConnect structure.  So, and we actually did that almost contemporaneous with the acquisition because the overlaps are just so obvious and so great and that is really -- that is working very well.", "Bill Warmington - Raymond James", "Good. ", "Frank Coyne", "And then, the connection of that set of capability, so starts retrieval and abstraction plus HEDIS, there is a very tight working relationship really at the level of the account, because when we are selling into the individual account you actually need to present the chart retrieval and abstraction solution at the same time as you present the HDC analytics and the five star analytics and that is what, all of that is part of the bundle that many customers are buying and so, we actually need to line all that up on a customer-by-customer basis when we're actually going to market.  And so we're well along on that also.", "And really conceptually all of that, everything you just asked about, Bill, it is in our minds, one integrated business and we just continue more and more to move in the direction of operating it exactly in that way.", "Bill Warmington - Raymond James", "Okay.  And the last question I just wanted to ask about how exactly are you doing on a standalone basis with the XactContents module, and any thoughts on the European expansion?", "Frank Coyne", "XactContents continues to grow well and its growth rate is outpacing the growth rate of the market.  It's one of the more highly growing parts of the Xactware portfolio.  We feel the market is coming in the direction of our solutions.  There is -- just for little color, there is a lot of working on content, which is very labor intense, and that's not our method.  It's we're doing it the Verisk way build it once and sell it many, many times.  And the market seems to be coming to that.", "And in Europe we continue to make very steady progress.  We've actually with one customer leaped across the English Channel into Mainland Europe, and we're very happy about that and we just continue to expect more and more growth throughout Europe.  And we're actually looking at other geographies as well.  It's a tool, which is extensible, and what paces that primarily actually is the availability of enough local data in order to have relatively good cost factors inside the mall.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.", "Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan", "I want to ask about the P&C insurance industry.  Obviously premiums were rising in 2011 to help your 2013 risk assessment growth.  I wanted to go further to say when the P&C insurance industry is doing better should it just lift your Decision Analytics insurance piece through request are in other products and if so, what would be the timing of any DA lift that you get from the insurance industry?", "Frank Coyne", "I mean, yes, you're generally on the right path.  But I guess what I want to just emphasize is the degree of one-to-one coupling of those two factors.  There is a lot that goes on inside of our customers' consideration of our solutions.  And the primary point is that every one of our DA solutions is going to get highly, highly scrutinized before it's purchased.  I mean, our customers are very sober minded, risk bearing entities, and they usually we go through a proof of concept.  And so, at the end of the day, their decision to buy a Decision Analytics solution is really based upon the value of that -- of that solution.", "It is true that if their results overall are stronger at the margin, I would say, their willingness to think about purchasing our new solutions that probably goes up somewhat but I really want to caution against you thinking that it\u2019s a one for one correspondence because it just doesn\u2019t work that way.  The sales cycles are long and the considerations are very technical when they look at minor products.  But yes, on balance, it is actually helpful.", "Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan", "I was asking about given the sales cycle that you just talked which are probably shorter when the P&C is doing better, when and how long do you think it will take to see benefit in your DA insurance segment for just the factor that the P&C insurance industry has been doing better for over a year now?", "Frank Coyne", "Well, again, I don\u2019t actually think the decision -- your premise is the one that we actually don\u2019t share.  So, I don\u2019t think that the coupling is as tight as maybe you're suggesting it in your question, but I would say that there are long smooth cycles inside of the insurance industry and I think the industry itself sort of observes changing behavior relatively slowly.  So, you should think in terms of sort of cycle thing out, it\u2019s over a couple of years basically.  And I again, the Decision Analytics decision making cycle is not really going to be respond all that strongly or all that quickly to what's going on inside of the industry overall.  (inaudible).  We're very optimistic about getting our solutions sold.", "Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan", "How long is a typical sales cycle to cross over new DA solution to insurance company?", "Frank Coyne", "18 months would probably be a good midpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Suzanne Stein with Morgan Stanley.", "Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley", "Have you disclosed the cost of the new healthcare platform, and can you just talk about how significant this could be from the cost side?  And this in terms of future margin?", "Frank Coyne", "Sure.  Suzy, I think we've described that we were talking about -- we call that two major initiatives that were taking place specifically around 2012 and it was the combination of the unified platform which is the healthcare platform in combination with our next generation platform which is the catastrophe modeling platform.  Now, what we said was the two combined for '12, we're targeting towards about $10 million.", "Now, I think your question as I heard it was really more focused the impact of margin.  So, when we talk about the $10 million a majority of that is programming cost.  So, as a result that is capitalized, it becomes a part of the CapEx.", "As a part of the overall initiative, clearly there is a lot of cost associated with modelers and scientists to help with the catastrophe modeling science, but a good chunk of our investment in \u201812 is going to be CapEx and I would tell you that as we think about 2013 it may become a little bit more period cost but not that dramatic.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect margins in too negative or material way.", "Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, I guess that was very helpful the question is also should that drive margin improvement in longer term?  I mean is that for cost efficiency over the long run?", "Scott Stephenson", "", "I'm going to go back and forth, this is Scott.  the answer is I think the opportunity there is to create a more robust platform and on the healthcare side it could become more efficient but the reality is we are doing this to drive top line growth.  I mean it is the ability to bring solutions together to make it easier for customers to buy and make user experience more pleasing and that has been kind of a lot of the focus of these two initiatives.", "Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great then just a quick one on share buybacks.  You've done a great job of returning capital to shareholders.  Do you think this will continue at a similar pace going forward?", "Frank Coyne", "Well as I think we have always said I mean we have a view that we are really trying to create shareholder return our first and primary focus is to invest in the business.  So the extent that we have opportunities around the acquisition front that would be our primary first use of capital and then we will continue to do buybacks to eliminate dilution.  ", "Extending beyond dilution and returning additional capital beyond that it\u2019s really a balancing act.  We try to take a look at little bit about the pipeline we want to make sure we have enough capacity to continue to execute on that growth strategy.  So, I think what you have seen over the last couple of quarters is a little bit of a dialing back because of the actual acquisition activity that we have had.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays", "Just a quick question on the international aspect.  Could you tell us what the mix now is for international and, I think Scott mentioned, you are seeing some pretty growth there, I understand is coming off a smaller base, but are we talking about high double digit?  So what sort of growth are we seeing there?", "Frank Coyne", "You got to bear in mind the base is very small, I mean, we really got only two businesses at the moment that have material international footprints.  And so, inside of our revenue overall non-domestic might be about 5% or something like that.  So the rates of growth are good but you are coming off from a very small base.  This is a long March for Verisk.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays", "Yeah, correct, okay, fair enough.  And then just from a strategic standpoint I guess in the mortgage division is the, obviously you have strong set of underwriting tools and you have, like you said, customer issue on the forensic side, but is this strategy that sort of just stick with the tools and ride out the storm per se or is that thought or opportunity around acquiring volume and market share and maybe bulking up that unit a bit?", "Frank Coyne", "That is not where our thinking goes at this time, so the acquiring and bulking up.  We do remain very interested in other forms of solution inside of the commercial banking industry, I mean, that is definitely in mind.  But when you look at the mortgage vertical itself we have a very complete set of solutions.  And we are continuing to try to make them better and we do believe that in normalized market conditions we would have a very nice business.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays", "So I guess to follow on that could you give us some idea of I guess, the other solution as you just referred to in the commercial banking industry and would that be sort of innovation coming from internally or would you need to acquire something?", "Frank Coyne", "Well, we are not really talking about our plans specifically in that area and as always we remain open to developing things internally and building our platform through acquisition.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays", "And last question just for Mark.  In terms of the Aspect Loss that acquisition. I mean. I know this is really small, should we see or should we be modeling any sort of contribution benefit from that deal?", "Mark Anquillare", "I just want to describe to you that it is really very much a tuck-in acquisition to a business that is it is small but growing inside of Verisk as a whole.  It is just not going to hit the (inaudible) or make any dramatic impact on revenue that you can consider.", "Operator", "Your next question is from James Friedman with SIG.", "James Friedman - SIG", "Hi, thanks for taking my question.  I wasn\u2019t sure if it was Mark or Scott who was speaking, but with regard to the healthcare client that you mentioned that's coming on board in the second half how does the revenue recognition work on that?", "Scott Stephenson", "Hi.  Do you want to take it, Mark?", "Mark Anquillare", "Yeah, just you'd appreciate what we are talking about was we are moving one large customer who is a pretty broad based customer, we are moving from our existing solution to our new unified platform.  That is kind of a test customer.", "So, from a revenue recognition perspective we are providing the same set of solutions, same set of services, we are continuing to roll out maybe some additional analytics because of the new platform, but the reality is the revenue reckoned does not change it is the same customer providing and we are providing a maybe more complete set but same set of our solutions.", "James Friedman - SIG", "I was just trying to figure out had there been any expenses that weren't offset by revenue at this stage in the customer's adoption?", "Mark Anquillare", "I think there has been cost to the overall unified platform but as most of that has been capitalized, so I don\u2019t think you can see a blip in any margin calculation that I think I tried to highlight that to Suzy so.", "James Friedman - SIG", "And then in addition, Mark, you had mentioned there was 20 bps, which is really helpful of impact in the insurance decision.  I just want to make sure I got the denominator right.  Was that 20 bps on the insurance Decision Analytics or was that on the Decision Analytics or was that on the company overall?", "Mark Anquillare", "Sure.  So, it is on the company overall and it is about 20 to 30 bps, yes.", "James Friedman - SIG", "Got you.  Yeah, that's a helpful number.  And then, lastly, it seem like the repurchase though substantial was slightly less than the east, let me get my language right, the KSOP, so you actually had a slight increase in the share account.  Is there anything to read into that or is that just a function f when the shares come on?", "Mark Anquillare", "Let me just remind everybody about the KSOP.  The KSOP in a majority of the expense was accelerated at the time of the IPO.  So we probably went it at and too much down for some investors, but that\u2019s in large part behind it, I will come back in a minute.  But all you see right now is a reserve as it relates to the KSOP is the 401K match component.  So really the only thing you should be seeing is maybe MediConnect coming in there, because this is a 401K match of those employees, but the reality is it should be pretty consistent and it's consistent with kind of how we match our employees contribution to that program.", "The other thing that I will just highlight is the way these SOPK is handled is that we need to take all those shares and pass them along to participants by the end of 2013, so it is depended up on what the value of the shares are and how many shares are left.  There could be, as we always talked about, some 2013 events that would be a non-cash one time type of item to end the ESOP plan.", "If you are looking broadly at our share count, and I am just trying to interpret some of your question, there were and continue to be option exercises associated with our long term incentive plans and maybe the option exercised and then number of shares coming out exceeded the buybacks we did in the quarter.  So, there was may be some dilution.  We try to handle that over the long term, not quarter by quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question from Jennifer Huang with UBS.", "Jennifer Huang - UBS", "Hi, thanks for taking the question.  Did you guys talk about the sales implementation cycle being I guess the 18 months for the -- on the insurance side.  Can you talk about that on the health care side?  And in terms of the revenue growth as we have seen in health care with inside on those revenues open products that were sold, so part of the solutions that were several quarters ago, so can you just talk about the pipeline in terms of sales and implementation currently and how that compares to may be a year ago?", "Frank Coyne", "Yeah, well, the pipeline is stronger than it was a year ago if for no other reason that we have more solutions.  And so, when -- we actually grid it out where we look at each customer and we look at which parts of our suite they buy and don\u2019t buy.  And relative to last year there is actually more white space on that grid because the solution sets are expanded even though there are -- we have filled in some of the customers on that same grid.  So that definitely the sense of opportunity in the market is greater.", "The sale cycles vary in healthcare depending up on which part of the solution mix that we are talking about.  So, when we talk about revenue integrity, those solutions actually tend to be on somewhat faster sale cycles.  There are also I would say among the things that we do they have some of the most easily quantified value propositions.  There is just a great urgency about getting the revenue integrity calculations right because reimbursement from Medicare, for example, literally hinges upon it, and it all occurs within the calendar year.", "So there is actually a genuine push on the part of the customers to get into those solutions, and I would embrace the MediConnect solutions inside of that.  At the other end of the spectrum would probably be the medical intelligence analytics that we sell which are very useful for getting things like actuarial calculations correct and reserving right, etc, but those tend to sort of slightly less urgently felt sorts of the needs.  And then -- so, I would say the sales cycles are longest there and probably in the 18 month plus range.  And then somewhere in the middle would be our payment accuracy solution where the value for opposition is strong and quantifiable, but the amount of integration that\u2019s required is a little bit greater and so it just tends to pace things a little bit more.", "Jennifer Huang - UBS", "Okay.  And that's very helpful.  And then I know there is still uncertainties out there around the healthcare reform --", "Frank Coyne", "Yeah.", "Jennifer Huang - UBS", "But as it stands today, I guess how do you think that -- how that impacts the healthcare business?", "Frank Coyne", "It really doesn\u2019t have a lot of impact.  I mean, you have to go back to the basic fast that most of our businesses with payors and the net effect of the healthcare reform would due to have more people on private or formal insurance system which on balance would just expand the size of that and so was sort of a moderate part -- a benign moderately positive basically.", "I would also say I think that the that there is also inside of the overall reform the government is putting a little bit more emphasis on using data analytics and emphasizing things like matching cost and quality outcomes.  And those are all good for us because anybody who just get more thoughtful about how to run healthcare is going to naturally be more interested in the kind of things that we do.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Bill Cork with KBW.", "Bill Cork - KBW", "Good morning, just wanted to go back to the expense side.  Sequentially, I think you had the impact of the equity awards this quarter.  Year-over-year you still have the comp increases and I think also this quarter you had some impact from the pension freeze.  Just trying to get a sense of where Q2 is from a run rate perspective and where we could expect the second half of the year to kind of shake out?", "Mark Anquillare", "So I mean let me just kind of reiterate I think what you said.  So, if I was to look at the second quarter and look at it solely you know, the salary increases that were in will remain for remainder of the year.  So, I don\u2019t think you would adjust for anything there. ", "The items that I will call out is inside of the margins we have a long term incentive with the equity compensation because of the way claim participants who are aged 62 vest we do have an acceleration in the second quarter.  That\u2019s about $4 to $4.5 million that affected the quarter and that will kind of normalize out for the remainder of the year.  So, that\u2019s something you should probably think about.", "Pension, I think you would probably expect that to just continue with what you saw first half.  And we did also mention that the acquisitions are a little bit seasonal.  So, the margins in the first half of the year are little bit lighter than what we will see in the second half.  So that\u2019s a bit of a positive in the second half as you think about margins overall.", "Operator", "And we have a follow up question from Kelly Flynn with Credit Suisse.", "Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse", "Thanks just a couple of quick follow ups.  First on the mortgage business, I know you said you expected to be weak for rest of the year but I was hoping you can help us work through how we should think about the tougher comp that the business had in this quarter and kind of should that lead to an improvement in the growth rate all else equal in the third and fourth quarter?  So why was the comp down if you could remind us and what impact did that have in the back half growth rate?", "Mark Anquillare", "I think we have always we said right from the beginning of the year is that we are targeting sometimes somewhere around 7% decline for the full year.  And I think what we view right now is we don\u2019t think we have enough information to change that view.  ", "From a comp perspective, we talked about a customer that has been kind of moving back to a more normalized level of forensic review that I think we saw more or less normalizing in the fourth quarter of this year.", "And the other thing that I highlighted was that what helped us in the first half was a kind of a pretty rich mortgage origination environment which was rather positive and I am not sure if the NBA and others expect that to continue for the second half and that works against us.", "So those are the things that like factoring just some of our thinking.  Obviously, I talked about the macro factors.  At the same time, I mean, I think we have a view that we are still winning customers and we are making progress both on the front end and call out on the back end.  So, all of that is, bodes well for the future but I want to be cautious about where we are today.", "Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse", "Okay, but it grew, I think it grew a percent in the second quarter of 2011 and I understand you had a customer kind of rolling off but that was a much better growth rate than any other quarter in the year.  Was there anything else going on there that made for that especially strong growth rate in the second quarter of \u201911?", "Mark Anquillare", "Well, I do know that the second quarter of \u201911 we were talking about that one customer, they did a lot of volume with us in that quarter.", "Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse", "Okay, so was that one customer okay, got it.  And then just another question on the insurance part of Decision Analytics.  I think clearly you guys have called out Xactware and some of the weather comps there, but could you give us a little more detail on the other businesses and I would ask it this way.  Which businesses are seeing accelerating growth in line item, and which ones are decelerating aside from Xactware?", "Mark Anquillare", "Want to talk a little bit about cash remodeling and kind of I think that will probably our strongest --", "Frank Coyne", "Yeah.  So I think, we have -- well, first of all, don\u2019t overlook the fact that inside of Xactware there is actually a variety of things that get done.  And some of them are related to claims and some of them are related to underwriting some of them are domestic and some of them are overseas.  And so you don\u2019t have to pick Xactware part.  And the growth rate associated with that bundle of thing would have been materially different if storm activity had been equivalent in 2012 to what it was in 2011.  So just that background.", "Other things that are going on inside of the insurance DA mix, two things I would particularly highlight.  One would be catastrophe modeling Mark talked about us literally sweeping the board in terms of all the capons issued in 2012 which we actually think of as the purest test of the quality of the science inside of the model.  And so, we find that a really encouraging result.", "Basically, there are still a lot of parallel country combinations to be modeled.  And we find that the market is very open to our solutions.  And all of that just compounds inside of the work we are doing, that create a new platform for serving up the models to get them even more inline with the customers workflows.  That will be one thing that I would point out.", "Another thing I would point out is underwriting.  As you know, we created an underwriting unit at the beginning of this year and its growth rate is very strong, it is greater than the growth rate of Decision Analytics overall.  And as we access where we sit in the P&C world, strengthening our underwriting solutions and our position is on of our biggest opportunity.  It is actually, that we are so strong in claims, we are so strong in catastrophe modeling, we are so strong in rating but underwriting is something where underwriting not rating is a place where we can still definitely gain altitude.  And so far in 2012 as well, the results have been good.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from Tim Mchugh with William Blair.", "Tim Mchugh - William Blair", "Just following up for the previous question.  I want to ask a similar question about healthcare.  If you can just talk about the different service lines or product lines, there they all seem to be doing well, but is there any one of them that is doing particularly better or worse relative to the others?", "Frank Coyne", "I mean basically, so just to kind of clarify what we do.  First of all, you can really put it -- we put it in the four buckets.  So, there is what we call enterprise analytics, which is the variety of medical intelligence products which are aimed at things like risk adjusting and risks scoring individual members of a population.  We have also got our enterprise intelligence, which is basically the OLAP platform through which a plan can consume the analytics and apply them to their decisioning.", "Then, we have got payment accuracy, which is coming through claims flows in order to basically clean those claims flows, find the one the claims that are suspicious and then take them through some clinical review in order to present a very clean view of the claim.", "And we supplemented that with what we did what we are now doing with our colleagues at Bloodhound, where in addition to that sort of retrospective -- I shouldn\u2019t say retrospective, later in the process analysis as we can also deal with the claims even before they are adjudicated inside of the claim system.  That is the second thing.", "Third thing is what we call revenue integrity, which is essentially helping our customers with their own reimbursement.  So, I mentioned before, HCC analytics for Medicare Advantage reimbursement.  And more generally, five star kinds of analytics that also relate to Medicare reimbursement.  So that is revenue integrity.", "And then, the fourth thing we do is, it is under the banner of MediConnect and its chart retrieval and abstraction.  So, it's getting the clinical data so that you can analyze it.  The first order use of that data actually is inside the things like HEDIS calculations, as well as the revenue integrity work that I just described.", "So, those are the four big buckets.  And they are all doing well actually and I think that is really the message here.  But I would say that probably, at the moment at least, we are getting a little bit more gross from chart retrieval abstraction and the revenue integrity set of things but that is detail underneath the general and/or of that we're well-positioned, its kind of everywhere really.", "Tim Mchugh - William Blair", "Okay.  And the workers comp opportunity that you are seeing in terms of the synergy between the P&C and MediConnect.", "Frank Coyne", "Right.", "Tim Mchugh - William Blair", "Where, is that in the healthcare business or you are coming at that from the insurance platform?", "Frank Coyne", "That the revenue gets recognized in the payment accuracy part of the healthcare business.  With a bigger assist from our P&C colleagues.  We are working on claims on the P&C side.", "", "Operator", "Thank you.  I would now turn the call back over Frank Coyne for any closing remark.", "Frank Coyne", "Yes.  Well, thank you very much for joining us on second quarter results and I would like to thank you for your interest and your questions.  And we look forward to well speaking with you again next quarter.  Have a good day.", "Operator", "", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Thank you. Ms. Eva Huston, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Eva Huston", "Great. Thank you, Brandy, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following some comments by Frank, Scott and Mark, highlighting key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions.", "The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K were provided on Tuesday and can be found in the Investor website of our -- Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Thank you, Eva, and good morning. Before going into comments on the third quarter, I would like to say our thoughts are with all our employees and all others who have been impacted by Sandy. We have continued to be operational throughout the storm and its aftermath and are supporting our customers at our usual excellent level of service. However, due to some travel and power issues, the management participants in this call are not in the same location.", "In third quarter 2012, we delivered strong overall performance of over 17% total revenue growth and 20% diluted adjusted EPS growth. Overall, our consolidated organic revenue growth was 8.5%, reflecting strong growth in healthcare and good growth in insurance solutions.  Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 10.8%. Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin of 45.9% in the quarter. Free cash flow was also strong, increasing over 15% year-to-date after adjusting for certain timing items and the previously discussed pension funding.  We are pleased with our results in the quarter.", "In the third quarter, our Risk Assessment revenue grew 4.9%, after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics in 2012. This growth is a continuation of what you saw in the first half and evidence of our strong subscription model.  In Decision Analytics, our revenue grew almost 30%, and our insurance solutions grew about 9%, even while we continue to face tough comps with regards to storm activity in 2011.", "While we certainly will see claims coming through from Hurricane Sandy, much of our claims volume revenue is contracted above current volume, and we will still experience tough comps versus fourth quarter 2011.", "Our healthcare solutions continued on the excellent organic growth path we have seen in the past few quarters, growing revenue above 47% organically in the quarter. Total healthcare revenue grew -- growth was almost 130% bolstered by the contributions MediConnect continues to make.  In the quarter, we generated almost $70 million in revenue from our healthcare business. Compared to 3Q 2009, our first quarter reporting after our IPO, our reported healthcare revenue increased by fivefold in just 3 years, making it a meaningful part of our enterprise.", "In mortgage and financial services, we are pleased to have closed our acquisition of Argus. And in the first month since closing, performance has been on target, and our future expectations have been reconfirmed.  With our mortgage tools, we are seeing recent trends continuing. Our origination-related revenue continues to grow in line with the market, while our overall mortgage revenue declined due to lower volumes of forensic review.", "We remain disciplined in our use of capital and are focused on delivering shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we have spent almost $800 million on acquisitions. We are excited about these acquisitions and believe our shareholders should be pleased by this use of capital, as evidenced by the acquisition's strong initial results and strategic fit.", "As we have previously communicated, we moderated our share repurchase in the quarter to about $21 million. We continue to be active in looking at M&A, but also continue to maintain our discipline, focusing on assets with the true strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth. We also remain focused on meeting our commitments to our debt holders as it relates to delevering back to our target ratios.", "In this quarter, we had strong financial results, and behind the numbers are many initiatives that we expect to bear fruit in the future. The creativity and deep domain expertise of our teams is evident, as we discussed our near-term and long-term objectives. And with our diversified portfolio, we have the ability to weather global uncertainty, while continuing to build a stronger Verisk.", "Now I'll turn it over to Scott to give you details about our progress in healthcare and other parts of the business.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you, Frank. We have a lot of exciting initiatives going on at Verisk, and I wanted to share a few with you to give you a sense of our current customer interactions, as well as some emerging opportunities that are not yet reflected in our numbers.", "First, our teams at AIR and AER have been working round the clock to provide real-time updates to their forecast on the path and impact of Hurricane Sandy. These estimates are vital to our customers, as they help them to understand what to expect and what will likely be a major impact on their business and operations.  While our teams may be operating remotely, they are in constant communication with customers about the storm. It's events like this that highlight our importance of our customers.", "Now to talk about the value we bring, away from the storm, our Healthcare business is performing very well and also exceeding -- executing on its plans for the future. We continue to make progress on our unified healthcare platform, and it is proceeding as expected.", "We talked about having a new customer live and on the fraud platform last quarter. And more recently, we expect to use the combined fraud platform to bring a large corporate customers' healthcare claims together to allow them to see aggregate spend across employees and coverage limits in the fourth quarter this year.  We estimate that our tool could save them substantial dollars and have a very strong ROI.", "We are also making excellent progress in bringing together our MediConnect business with our revenue integrity platform, a lot of this work is operational and involves ensuring that we work together seamlessly, both on the sales front and also on the customer delivery front.", "We are finding the teams energized by working together, as well as being a part of the bigger Verisk health platform and mission. As well, we continue to see the combination of our solutions and teams resonating with customers through new sales and improving product pipelines.", "We also continue to work to find ways to use our numerous capabilities in data sets across multiple functions, verticals or geographies. The aggregated medical database for P&C insurers for healthcare claims is running well and bringing significant value to our customers. We are also continuing our development of the next generation platform for our catastrophe models, and we expect to launch the customers in 2013.", "We are also using our weather data for P&C companies and continue to make traction in that space. And with the addition of Argus, we have spent time during the first 60 days holding brainstorming sessions between the Argus team and existing Verisk businesses. These sessions are leading to discoveries around how we can repurpose the data models built by Argus to deliver solutions to other customers, including in the insurance space.", "Internationally, we are working on translating our substantial intellectual property into new markets, where no or limited analytics exist today. This is a long-term project, but the reception we're finding so far is very encouraging.", "All of what we are doing is about creating innovation within our company, as that will permit us to reimagine and enlarge our markets. We must continue to know both our current customers' value propositions, as well as relate to our customers as development partners, and we're committed to both.", "With that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Thanks, Scott. You've heard some of the exciting things that are going on in our business, and I'll share some of the numbers as the results of these efforts.", "In the third quarter, we delivered 17.3% total revenue growth and 8.5% organic revenue growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic growth in the quarter was 10.8%.  For the third quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue continued to lead with 27.4% growth, of which 11% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of MediConnect, Aspect Loss Prevention and Argus, as well as the transferred revenue for the mortgage appraisal tools.", "As a reminder, in 2012, we transferred revenue related to the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessments, property-specific revenue categories into Decision Analytics mortgage and financial services revenue category. We will continue to provide you visibility into the apples-to-apples comparisons throughout 2012.", "Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 8.6% in the third quarter and 8.3% organically, excluding June, July acquisition of Aspect Loss Prevention. We continued strong double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions.  We also saw improved growth in our loss quantification solutions despite continued to lower levels of storm activity in 2012 versus the same period in 2011.", "I knew you have a question on the impact of Sandy on our volumes through exact analysis. As you may remember, our multi-year customer contracts include an annual days number of claims to be processed that varies by client. To give you a sense, we are tracking below the contracted amounts of claims year-to-date. So we don't expect to see the transactional bump we saw last year, when clients went into overages.  For 2012, we have approximately 20% more claims volumes under contract than in 2011. So we're not currently forecasting overages.  Also in the quarter, Claims Solutions delivered good growth.", "In mortgage and financial services, we grew 10.8%, reflecting the addition of Argus as of August 31. Argus is an excellent business, and we're pleased with the performance today and continue to see opportunity, at least as large than we initially anticipated. After adjusting for the acquisition of Argus and it's transfer to the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment into this revenue category in the third quarter revenues declined 11.9%.", "We continue to see the same themes that we've been discussing in previous quarters. Underwriting tools grew nicely in the quarter and reflected the growth in the mortgage application to the market. Our revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter, more than offsetting that growth.", "To provide additional clarity on these trends, a quick reminder about the shape of our business. Broadly speaking, there are 2 types and 2 parts of the mortgage business, what we call the front end, the part that are related to originations and refinancings. It's about half of the mortgage business and is performing well. The other part is what we call the forensic piece. That's about half the business and about 4% of consolidated revenue in the quarter.", "The forensic business benefited from the surge in demand in the wake of the financial crisis. That demand is now subsiding. To frame the potential downside for you, before the crisis, the forensic business is about $10 million on an annual basis, with business primarily from 1 of our 2 large current customers. We are now in the process of reverting to historic levels.  However, because our customers remain somewhat uncertain about where their needs will stabilize, it is harder for us to get kind of forward visibility into our mortgage revenue that characterizes most of our businesses.", "Based upon our latest review of the mortgage business, our current expectation is that there is more revenue likely to roll off as a part of this normalization process, including in the fourth quarter of 2012. We have projected in early 2012 that our mortgage revenue in aggregate for the year will decline similar to the fourth quarter 2010 or about 7%.", "Our current revenue expectation for the fourth quarter now leads us to believe the decline for the full year 2012 will be in the 12% to 15% range. The EBITDA margins in this business are below the segment average, so there is less of an impact on the bottom line than top line.  Now, of course, when we aren't standing still, we continue to develop new solutions that bring value to our customers, and those opportunities will create new revenue streams in our forensic space.", "Healthcare continues strong revenue growth, 129% for the third quarter and 47.4% organic. Healthcare organic growth year-to-date is 41%. Our total growth benefited from the second quarter addition of MediConnect.", "Organically, we continue to add, implement new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers. Both the acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners became part of the organic growth calculation this quarter and have added to organic growth, although all of the businesses are growing nicely.", "As a reminder, we do have seasonality in our Revenue Integrity and MediConnect businesses related to the CMS review cycle. And the revenue between third quarter and fourth quarter can be a bit fluid depending on customer schedules. While I expect to see strong, continued growth year-over-year next quarter, we may see a modest sequential dip in dollar revenue.  Our Specialized Markets grew 11% in the third quarter, with growth both from the supply chain solutions as well as weather analytics.", "Turning to Risk Assessment. We reported revenue growth of 2.8% in the quarter and 4.9% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer we discussed earlier.  Our industry-standard programs grew 5.8% in the quarter, reflecting our 2012 invoices and strong growth from our premium leakage solutions. Our property-specific revenue declined 5.1% as reported, but excluding the transfer grew 4% based upon new sales and higher volumes, as well as growth in appraisal solutions.", "EBITDA for the third quarter was $182.9 million as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 21.1% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 45.9%, reflecting good expense management, as well as seasonal benefit of some of our healthcare businesses. We continue to see opportunities from investing in future growth, and as you remember, those can have a near-term impact on margins, but grow our future opportunity.", "In the quarter, the Risk Assessment margins were 54.6% versus 50.5% in third quarter 2011. We benefited by about 2% on the margin due to this lower pension costs related to the freeze of the plan in February. Our business continues to show scalable profitability, while we also continue to invest in developing new solutions.  Margins in Decisions Analytics was 40.9% in third quarter 2012 versus 40.1% in third quarter 2011. Our acquisitions of MediConnect and Argus added slightly to our margins.", "Our interest expense was up $3.5 million versus third quarter 2011, based upon higher debt balances related to our acquisitions. We ended third quarter with total debt of $1.6 billion, including the $380 million to fund the Argus acquisition on August 31.  Our reported effective tax rate was 39.3% for the quarter, which we expect to continue for the rest of 2012.", "Coming down to net income. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense, less income tax, except on that acquisition -- on that amortization.  Our adjusted net income increased 20.9% to $92.2 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS, on a fully diluted basis, was $0.54, an increase of 20%, a great growth rate.", "The average diluted share count was 171.7 million shares in the quarter. As of September 30, 2012, our diluted share count was 171.5 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased 425,000 shares or about $21 million. At quarter end, we had about 179 million left under our authorization. As we discussed last quarter, we have moderated our buyback program after acquiring Argus to ensure that we meet our deleveraging commitments. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of over 25%.", "Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, our cash and cash equivalents were $98 million. Total debt, both short term and long term, totaled about $1.6 billion, reflecting the borrowed funds to acquire Argus, which closed on August 31.", "Post-Argus, our debt capacity is over $850 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA ratio at September 30, including a full year of historical results for both MediConnect and Argus, was 2.2x, down from the pro forma ratio of 2.35x we cited at the time of the acquisition. As we've stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunity, because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly.", "Free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2012, which we define as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, was $264.2 million, a decrease of about $11.3 million or negative 4.1% versus the 9 months of 2011. This decline was principally due to the funding of our pension, which we have mentioned previously. Excluding the impact of our pension, net of the tax benefit and certain year-over-year timing issues, our free cash flow was up about 16%.", "Our capital expenditures was about 5.1% of revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012. Free cash flow represented 52.2% of EBITDA in the first 9 months of 2012, reflecting a reduced conversion rate due to the $72 million pension funding, partially offset by the associated tax benefit.", "As we have indicated previously, we moderate our share buyback program as we delever following the solid acquisitions we made this year. We would anticipate that the share count in 4Q may be up about 1%.", "Overall, our business is performing very well, and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and continue to invest in the future. We see that both our subscription and transaction revenue is growing well. Even with our transaction revenue, while we see some variations around that revenue, the purchase of our solutions is largely nondiscretionary, and therefore, we have good visibility into the future.", "With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Mark, with the guidance you gave about the sequential dip in healthcare revenue and absolute dollar terms for Q4, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right. Would that assume a year-over-year growth rate in the single digits to the maybe the low to mid-teens?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Well, I mean, I don't want get into very specifics. I didn't go over -- just trying to describe this. We see very strong growth for healthcare, both in aggregate and organically in fourth quarter. But when you consider seasonality, and if you actually look at the absolute dollars in third quarter relative to fourth quarter, we're just talking about what we see from an absolute dollar amount, 4Q relative to 3Q.", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then starting again next year, and then '13, would you suspect the growth rates to reaccelerate then?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Well, we have high hopes, and we continue to be very bullish on the prospects for healthcare. So I think we feel good about healthcare. We continue to just describe that it's a growing business. We expect growth. But over time, the law of large numbers takes over. So we would expect that it's going to be -- continue to grow. But at the percent levels of today, I think will be diminishing over time.", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, just one more in healthcare. In the past, you talked about being in early innings in terms of completing implementations and then being able to recognize revenue. Are we still in the early innings there or no? And then how is the pace of new integration startups going?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So let me take the beginning of that, and then maybe I can ask Scott to just comment. So the first thing that we're -- are saying is a, from a back-end perspective, from a fraud perspective, we are implementing the customers. You're seeing that in the revenue now, and we have a very good and improved process around implementing customers. So there's a combination of a, existing customers rolling out more regions and states. That's good that's in, and that continues. At the same time, we have signed new customers. And that does take a little time to ramp up, and that will have kind of more of a tail to it into 2013. That is particularly true on the front end. When we sell the customer on the front end, we do require information and data from them, And then we turn around some of the models. And there, there's a little bit of a deferral until we are able to deliver the product to those customers. So that is also kind of a deferral of sorts from a revenue rack. But I think you see the trend, and you can see the opportunity, as both the pipeline and new customers come to fruition are implemented. Scott, maybe you can comment a little more on the progress.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, I think you said it well. I would just add that this effect of catching up with respect to implementations is particularly felt in our payment accuracy business. And we're certainly not complete in that process, but we do continue to make progress, as Mark said. And I would just say that you have to account for the fact that our mix is shifting a little bit also. And all of what we do that we call Revenue Integrity is just becoming a more and more important fraction of the total of what we do in the healthcare space. So we do have a mix effect in there as well.", "Eva Huston", "Eric, it's Eva. I just want to add one clarifying point on healthcare. Fourth quarter 2011 healthcare revenue was $38 million. And this quarter, we did $69 million.", "Frank J. Coyne", "And you did have a question on how the integration is going, and we're very pleased with our progress there. And the synergies of the business are really showing enhanced opportunities in the marketplace.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Evercore Partners. Scott, could you provide a little bit more granular insight into the underlying drivers of the 47% organic revenue growth in healthcare? And to what extent is superior growth sustainable in this business? Perhaps not at the 47% level, but if you could perhaps take us out into 2013 and talk about how some of those growth drivers might play out?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes, happy to. First of all, I think everybody's aware, but I'll just kind of refresh you that we actually do a variety of different things in the healthcare space. We do risk adjusting, which we call our Enterprise Analytics group, and all of the analytics driven off of that. We do payment accuracy, which is combing through claims flows to make sure that there are no fraudulent ways or abusive claims. And then we do a lot of work in the revenue integrity space, which is the collection of things that we do, which is fundamentally that helping plans to assure that they're being completely and properly reimbursed for the work that they do, particularly if it's in the Medicare context, so a wide variety of things. And MediConnect, our most recent acquisition, actually supports both the revenue integrity business, but also the opportunity to accumulate clinical data will increasingly become meaningful inside of our enterprise analytics. So with that as the backdrop, we're really kind of hitting on all cylinders is the sort of the first part of the answer. So I wouldn't really point to any one thing. I would say that it is the case that Verisk Health collectively has really emerged as a meaningful vendor inside of the space. We bring a number of things. We bring a lot of unique intellectual property. We bring kind of a unique positioning, because, we, I think, we're seen as, in many ways, as kind of a Switzerland inside of the space. I think it's been noticed by the marketplace that Verisk is strongly supportive of what -- of our business in the healthcare arena. And so that kind of corporate commitment, I think, does -- we're selling a lot of enterprise-level applications. And so that level of commitment really does communicate into the market, creating an even greater sense of confidence to buy our solutions. And the healthcare space remains one where there is mounting interest on the part of our customers in using data analytics to drive their decision making. So it's -- it's very broadly based, I would say. And as Mark said before, we remain very optimistic about the opportunity to continue to grow the business in the future. I mean, we have, from time to time, at Investor Day meetings and in other forums, just made the point that the space is very large. And you know what our run rate was in the third quarter. We are still relatively modest in terms of the fraction of the overall market that we represent. So it's a very broad -- and what's happening right now is very broadly based. It's not one part of our business, and it's not one team. And it's certainly not related to what's going on with respect to regulation in the healthcare space. That's sort of mildly benign from our perspective.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Bracket for us, some reasonable organic growth expectations for healthcare in 2013?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I don't think we put out numbers like that. But the -- again, I'll just say that the kinds of conditions, which are underlying the performance that we've turned in recently, we don't see any changes in those. Obviously, third quarter organically was very strong, but the underlying conditions remain.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And just a question for Mark, if I might. I just want to understand your comments on the mortgage business. For 2012, I think your updated guidance was down 12% to 15% for the year versus 7%. What's changing your thinking on the forensic side that would lead you to reduce guidance for the year?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "I think the short answer is, we are very much dependent upon our customers to provide us with insight as to what and how much service they need, and we just haven't seen the type of commitment from customers that we need to feel confident about fourth quarter. And specifically, we think that they're going to need less. So we are trying to provide you with as much information insight as we have. The reality is most of our businesses, those type of transactional services are very much nondiscretionary in the minds of most of our customers. The mortgage, and specifically, the forensic review, is unlike that, and we just felt that, that's the best guess right now around 4Q.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Are you signaling cost reduction actions to limit any earnings impact from that decline?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Well, I think we've always been very cost conscious. So to the extent that you think about a decline in top line, we're going to be try to be as thoughtful around expenses as possible. But obviously, it's tough to pull enough expense out to offset the type of declines that we've seen on the top.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the trajectory of the RA growth, which has been mid single-digit going into next year. And I wanted to know if it's likely that Verisk's RA segment will accelerate in 2013, knowing January is a key point, asking about the lag effects of the 4% P&C premium growth in 2011.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Yes, Mark?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure. Thank you, Frank. I think what we continue to see is, first of all, we like the fact that, there's a stronger market that helps our customers and, obviously, a customer that is feeling good about their business, they make it more apt to more likely to purchase services from others. when we think about, specifically, premiums, I think the way we continue to interact with customers is not just about a Risk Assessment or how our industry standard programs will interact. But more importantly, what's the best way to grow our business with our customers across the insurance space in broad term. So clearly, the harder market or at least better pricing, I'm not sure if it's going to be called the harder market, will potentially have good news for our customers. I think we're going to remain as pretty tempered in the way we think about Risk Assessment, because what we really believe is the opportunity to grow inside those insurance customers is to sell them some Decision Analytics customer -- excuse me, Decision Analytics products and our customers receive value there. And we think that's the best way to grow our business, and we continue to believe that.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Sure. No, I understand your answer. And surely, a broader customer sell is great, but is it there some mechanics with your RA line and the premiums that are up in 2011?", "Frank J. Coyne", "So I think you were talking about the industry-standard program. Those premiums are related to our invoices. But as I said, I think we've always described it as -- typically, we try to put in some type of inflationary type of increases. And I think we would continue to think about that into the future, because we really do believe there's some good opportunity to make sure that we can sell -- continue to sell more product and bigger volumes of product into those customers, as well as those industry-standard programs. So I don't see a sweeping uptake, no. I think we will be pretty tempered in the way we handle those.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kelly Flynn with Credit Suisse.", "Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I want to go back to healthcare. I was wondering if you could just be a little bit more clear in the sequential revenue decline. Do you expect that at both MediConnect and the rest of the Healthcare business? Or is it going to be more pronounced at one or the other?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Mark, why don't you start that?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure. So I think we've always talked about the fact that a combination of MediConnect and the Revenue Integrity businesses are very much focused on the latter part of the year, and it's tied to the CMS review process. So what we're just trying to describe is that we continue to see wonderful growth. But as you think about those 2 businesses, which are, for the most part, the latter part of the year weighted, it's a little difficult to understand how things move between third and fourth quarter. And we have seen a good third quarter. I think we would continue to see a good fourth quarter. But in absolute dollar terms, we could see a slight dip between third and fourth quarter because of those 2 specific businesses.", "Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I mean, just back to the comment someone made earlier about the implied growth. I mean, I think it does come in at the high single-digits organically, if you calculate based on everything you said. And I know you tried to clarify, Eva, but it didn't really change the imprint, so I'm just wondering if you want to clarify any further.", "Eva Huston", "Yes, Kelly, I think if you did the simple math, and you took -- again, we're not going to give you forecast for the fourth quarter, but look at the third quarter revenue, look at what MediConnect did. And if you just did that simple math and took out MediConnect, because again, where I believe you're getting too organic, you would see a double-digit growth rate, if you did that math. Now both of those pieces may move a bit, but I think that, that would be the simple math.", "Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then can we talk about Argus? I think you said -- I think maybe, Frank, in your comments that your future expectations were reconfirmed. But I was hoping you could just reconfirm them as far as the numbers. Are you still also thinking about that as a 15% to 20% organic grower? And then maybe you could comment on the margins. I think Mark said they were accretive to the corporate margin. Does that imply that it's higher than what the EBITDA margin was this quarter? And that's what we should expect going forward?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Yes, I'll turn to Mark for the numbers. But I would reconfirm, and Scott had indicated in his comments that as we have visited with Argus that has both great leadership and tremendous assets, we see a lot of opportunities for our entire enterprise. Beyond our original expectations, though we were optimistic that, that's what we would find. Mark, why don't you comment on the numbers?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure. I mean, everything that we've said in the past, with regard to the growth rate that you described are -- I think we remain consistent with us. And specifically around margins, yes, I mean, the Argus has some wonderful margins. As you've seen in historic results, they're actually running ahead of the Verisk margins, and I think that will continue into the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.", "Unknown Analyst", "[indiscernible] in for Tim this morning. I just want -- I appreciate the color you guys you gave earlier on the healthcare business. And I just want to specifically ask about MediConnect. If we compare that to the rest of the healthcare practice, how would you compare that growth rate? Is it similar, is it slower or faster on a organic basis?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Mark?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So MediConnect, once again, was not a part of our operations in 2011. And if you looked at some of the filings we did regarding the prior year, I think you'll see that MediConnect has been growing extremely well, and I think, probably, a little bit faster than the organic growth we even described for our healthcare business. So they are doing well. And it is -- it's ramped very nicely. And I think, as Scott described, a part of the power of MediConnect is not just Medicaid alone, it's a part of that overall suite of solutions. The business that is our Revenue Integrity business, in combination with some of the HEDIS reporting and the MediConnect business all in one provide a very nice suite of solutions to a set of customers. And I think it's been well received by our customers.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And then if we looked at the acquisition environment right now, could you maybe talk a little bit about the opportunities you're seeing there? And if there are any particular sectors you guys are looking at more than others?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Yes, let me comment on that. There are opportunities out there. There are no particular sectors that we look at more the others. As I observed in my comments, and this is Frank, we're looking for good strategic fits at what we consider an appropriate price, given the growth profile the companies that we look at. There are certain characteristics that we particularly like that is that they have business models much like the businesses that we have. And as we look for international opportunity, that's a plus. But we see opportunities, especially in supply chain, to add to our portfolio. But we're not exclusive to just that. We look across the entire spectrum of our strategic map.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Clark with KBW.", "William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Healthcare margins being modestly lower than insurance, yet you've been able to maintain and even grow overall Decision Analytics margins as healthcare has become a bigger piece of that segment. Just trying to find out if you'd say that, that's more due to the GAAP between healthcare and insurance margins closing? Or are you seeing margin expansion across all verticals and the difference between kind of product types is staying about the same?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Mark? Mark, are you still with us?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure, I apologize. One of the great things about all of our businesses, there's natural operating leverage across the board. So to your specific question, we have seen an increase in the margins inside of our Healthcare business, in part, that's because we have more volumes running through, doesn't take as many people to run those volumes through to natural scale. The other thing that has happened is to the point that we're talking about earlier, we weren't able to recognize as much revenue. Implementation takes time. It takes effort. And then sometimes, that revenue is somewhat deferred. So you're seeing the cumulative effects of both of those on the Healthcare business. And also, just to be clear, across-the-board, with the exception of mortgage, obviously, we see and have seen scale and ramping margins in our Decision Analytics businesses.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Raymond James.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So a question for you on your long-term EBITDA margin targets. We've talked about 43% to 45% in the past, and you guys look like you're on target to actually be above that potentially this year. And with the Argus acquisition, that would seem to put upward pressure on that. So with that in mind, is that still a way we should be thinking about it? Or are we thinking that it's probably likely to move up into the 44% to 46% range?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Mark?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure, so let me take that on. I think the reality is, yes you're right, right now, we are running a bit above. I think what we continue to talk to you about and make sure everyone's aware of is that we really don't think about ways that we can keep our margins high. We think about ways that we can grow cash flows, and we can grow our top line for the long term. With that in mind, we are happy to see a lot of our business units coming to us with investment ideas and investment opportunity that have started in third quarter and will continue into 4Q and into '13? So there's some costs that we feel will happen. We also expect that will contribute to the top line into the future. And although Argus and MediConnect have some very strong margins, as you noted, it is tough to find businesses to acquire that have those type of margin characteristics. So as we think about the long term, still -- we think we still remain a little bit tempered about how big those margins can be, because what we're most and first focused on is longer-term growth.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then if you could remind us the comps on the mortgage business in the fourth quarter versus third quarter, I believe, eased. Is that enough to offset some of that decline? Or are we still likely to see another 200 basis point type drag?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Just to recap. I mean, I think when we talked about the range of 12% to 15% for the full year, we factored in the fourth quarter of 2011. So I think that is kind of our best guess, full year, including the comp in 4Q of '11.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. One last question for you was on the -- your -- how do you balance the -- your goal of taking leverage from 2.2 to 2? And then also the share repurchase and the M&A opportunities?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Good question. I think what we've tried to do is really be very thoughtful about our capital management program. So at the time Argus came along, we were in talks and knew about Argus for a long time. It was a unique opportunity. And we said, we want to continue to be very growth oriented. That is our primary focus. And at that point, we've been telling everybody that we would go above that 2x target. I think, once that happened and we jumped above the 2x, we now have been thoughtful about the cash that goes out the door, and that comes in the form of acquisitions. We will do the right acquisitions. There'll probably be for a bit of a time, a little bit smaller. At the same time, we've also dialed back our buyback program, so that hopefully, in the near term, we'll be back towards that 2x level. And we have a little greater flexibility around acquisitions, as we kind of go into the future towards the latter part of -- in the middle of 2013.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Could you remind us, how big is the catastrophe modeling business as a percentage of revenue? And with Sandy and, obviously, Katrina not that far back. While, the claims, it sounds like you're not going to get a spike there. Does it impact kind of your clients' view on overall P&C, and just bode well for the business longer-term as we think about it going forward?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Mark, do you want to start that with percentages?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure. So let me -- first of all, obviously, we haven't provided you specific visibility into the cat remodeling business. It is a significant part of our insurance category within Decision Analytics. It has been growing very nicely over the last year. And I think, Frank, from the standpoint of characteristics and how the market...", "Frank J. Coyne", "Yes, I'll go there. And yes, sure. I'd make this observation. We -- the cat modeling business did not get recognized until we had Andrew on the heels of Hugo, '89 and 2002, I think, Andrew was. And then, since then, of course, it has had significant tick up. What will likely happen here is that we -- number one, AIR delivers great science and great products, and that's being recognized. So we're getting more opportunities to be sometimes an additional model to companies that have not been customers of ours in the past. We have done 100% of the cat bonds. We have the model within 100% of the cat bonds that have been issued this year. And we're finding that other industries are recognizing the value of these catastrophe models and their enterprise risk management. So we will see -- we'll, a, recognition of the value proposition around the product. And b, I think, that we'll see more market opportunities as risk managers understand that these cat models can be used in their organizations beyond just P&C.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Got it. And Frank, can you just remind us what other industries beyond the traditional P&C your kind of focusing on this services?", "Frank J. Coyne", "Well, I can point to one that we've already gotten some pickup, and that's crop, where the models have that impact. But when you think of supply chain in its entirety, the disruption associated with that, I think, is going to cause -- with Sandy is going to cost increased focus on how companies can get a better handle, enterprises can get a better handle on their exposures.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. And again, there are no further questions.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Do we have no more questions, operator?", "Operator", "No, sir, there are no further questions.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Okay, well, thank you very much. We appreciate everyone joining us. We're sorry that we had a delay, but we think it was a prudent decision. And we appreciate the value of the questions and the quality of them and look forward to speaking with you the next quarter. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until March 28, 2013, on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "And now I will turn the call over to Frank Coyne.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In fourth quarter 2012, we delivered strong overall performance of over 18% total revenue growth and 26% diluted adjusted EPS growth. For the full year, total revenue growth was 15% and diluted adjusted EPS growth was 20%.", "Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6.7%, reflecting strong growth in healthcare and good growth in insurance solutions, offset by weakness in mortgage. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 9.4% in both the quarter and for the year. Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin of over 45% in the quarter and for the year. Free cash flow was also strong, increasing over 25% in 2012, even after our pension funding in the earlier part of the year.", "In the fourth quarter, our Risk Assessment revenue grew 5%, after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics in 2012, and also grew 5% for the year, reflecting the value to our long-standing insurance company customers of our industry-standard insurance programs and property-specific data. In Decision Analytics for the quarter, our revenue grew almost 30% and our insurance solutions grew about 10%, even as transactional claims activity related to Sandy and other storms was captured under existing contracted customer minimums.", "Our healthcare solutions continued their excellent organic growth, growing revenue about 28% organically in the quarter. Total healthcare revenue growth was almost 90%, including the contributions MediConnect continues to make. In the quarter, we generated over $70 million in revenue from our healthcare business.", "In financial services, we continue to be pleased that Argus' performance has been on target and our future expectations remain on track. Within our mortgage tools, we are seeing recent trends continuing. Our origination-related revenue continues to grow ahead of the origination market, while our overall mortgage revenue declined, although slightly less than we expected it to when we talked to you last quarter. We will continue to face challenges in mortgage in 2013 as the forensic business moves back towards normalized level. But overall, our business is now more diverse in both customer and solution set.", "We remain disciplined on our use of capital and are focused on delivering shareholder returns. In 2012, we spent about $800 million on acquisitions, primarily MediConnect and Argus. We find the results of our acquisitions encouraging and believe our shareholders should be pleased by this use of capital, as evidenced by strong initial results and strategic fits.", "Our share repurchases remained moderated in the quarter at $35 million as we continue on the path to meet our commitments to our debt holders. Total repurchase activity in 2012 was $163 million. We continue to be active in looking at M&A but also continue to maintain our discipline, focusing on assets with a true strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects.", "In this quarter, and more importantly, for the full year 2012, we had strong financial results. The ongoing experience, knowledge and dedication of our employees across our enterprise position us well for 2013.", "You've also seen the announcement last week that I will be transitioning the CEO role to Scott Stephenson in April. I am pleased to continue to serve on the board as Non-Executive Chairman. Scott has been a key member of our management team for over a decade and is the right person to carry forward our culture of performance.", "Now I'll turn it over to Scott for an update on some of our initiatives.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you, Frank, very much. These are exciting times for Verisk, and I'm really very pleased that we will have the continued guidance and counsel that Frank will be providing as Chairman of our board.  As you all know, we have strong team running our businesses on a day-to-day basis, and you'll be hearing directly from many of them at our Investor Day on March 7.", "Our deep industry expertise has made us successful and will continue to help us enhance and develop new analytic and data-driven solutions for our customers now and into the future. Another driver of our success is our culture of innovation and continuous improvement. About a month ago, our leadership team was together and we had a chance to talk about the ways we can continue to drive innovation and the analytic mindset throughout our 6,500 employees.", "Our teams are energized, and we have a good crop of investment opportunities that we will be funding in 2013 and beyond. For example, remote-sensing and imagery is one of those. We are gathering images that can be used to identify risks beforehand and then quantify them afterward. Something else that we talk about a lot is the idea of the N+1 data set. At Verisk today, we have about 5 petabytes of data, which definitely qualifies us as a big data shop. Our creativity in analyzing these data to develop new solutions will allow us to make our individual proprietary data assets into new data sets by combining them with other data sets. If there are N data sets in the world, we can have more insight by creating N+1. If our customers have N data sets, we can create more insight by creating N+1. Always, always looking to add more value.", "With that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover some of the financial results in more detail.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Thanks, Scott. As you've heard, we are pleased with our performance for both the fourth quarter and full year 2012. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 18.2% total revenue growth and 6.7% organic revenue growth. For fiscal year 2012, total revenue growth was 15.2% and organic revenue growth was 7.3%. Excluding our historical mortgage business, our revenue growth organically in the quarter and the full year was 9.4%.", "For the fourth quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue delivered 28.7% growth, of which 7.9% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of MediConnect, Argus and Aspect Loss Prevention, as well as the transfer of revenue for the mortgage appraisal tools. As a reminder, in 2012, we transferred revenue related to mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment's property-specific revenue category into Decision Analytics' financial services revenue category. Going forward, in 2013, we will discuss growth rates treating the appraisal tools revenue as a part of Decision Analytics. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category revenue grew 9.6% in the fourth quarter and 9.3% organically, excluding the acquisition of Aspect Loss Prevention.", "We continued good growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter and finished 2012 with 95% market share for public property catastrophe bond modeling. We also saw growth from our loss quantification solutions. As discussed in our third quarter call, we did not expect to see a bump in growth due to Sandy because many of our customers were below minimum contracted claims volumes, and that proved to be the case. Claims solutions delivered good growth. Our underwriting solutions continued to add strong growth.", "In financial services, which include both Argus and the mortgage business, revenue grew 41.8% in the quarter. Argus is an excellent business, and we remain pleased with the performance since the acquisition in the third quarter, which has exceeded our estimates provided at the time of the acquisition. After adjusting for the acquisition of Argus and the transfer of the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment into this revenue category, in the fourth quarter, revenues declined 19.6%. For all of 2012, revenues declined 11.3%, a result that was slightly better than our expectations as discussed with you last quarter.", "Consistent with recent trends, mortgage origination tools grew nicely in the quarter and reflected the growth in the mortgage origination market. But revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter by more than offsetting them. In thinking about the mortgage portion of financial services for 2013, I believe it's possible we could see a similar decline to the 11% we saw in the full year 2012.", "Healthcare continues its strong revenue growth, 89.1% for the fourth quarter and 115% for 2012. Healthcare organic revenue growth was 28.5% in the fourth quarter and 36.2% for the full year. Our total revenue growth benefited from the second quarter addition of MediConnect, another acquisition that has performed strongly in 2012.", "The performance to date validates our strategy of combining our Revenue Integrity and HEDIS reporting solutions with MediConnect to create a comprehensive solution, RQI, or Revenue and Quality Intelligence. Organically, we continue to add and implement new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers. The 2011 acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners became a part of our organic growth calculation in the third quarter.", "As a reminder, we do have seasonality in our Revenue and Quality Intelligence revenue. As you recall, we generally expect the first half of the year to be seasonally low with more revenue to come in the second half. This means for Verisk Health overall, the shape of our business is going to be in the 60-ish percent towards the second half of the year. Split across quarters can vary depending upon customer needs. Also it means margins are seasonally lower in the first half. And as Verisk Health is scaled, you'll see that more in Decision Analytics.", "If you are looking at quarters, I would also point out that the performance of MediConnect in the first quarter of 2012 includes $3 million or $4 million of overflow revenue from 4Q 2011, which you should assume won't occur in 1Q of '13. The revenue from 1Q '12 was prior to our acquisition and disclosed in our filings. We continue to feel very good about our growth prospects in the healthcare vertical.", "Our specialized markets. Revenue grew 4.4% in fourth quarter with good growth from our weather and climate analytics and more modest growth from our supply chain solutions due to customer timing. The revenue category grew 8.3% for the full year.", "Turning to Risk Assessment. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2012, we reported revenue growth of 2.9% and 5% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer we discussed earlier. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 5.8% in the quarter, reflecting our 2012 invoices and strong growth in our premium leakage solutions. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we have included the actuarial services and statistical agency service categories as a part of industry-standard programs, that they are closely tied to, and build as a part of our same customer invoices. Our property-specific information revenue declined 6% in the quarter as reported, but excluding the transfer, grew 2.6%. Our customers have received and began paying their 2013 invoices, which are modestly higher than 2012.", "EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $189.6 million, as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 19.4% for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 45.6%, reflecting good expense management. We produced $695.9 million of EBITDA for the full year with margins of 45.4%, including a $13 million decline in pension expense due to the freeze versus 2011, or an 80 bps margin expansion.", "The margins in Decision Analytics were 40.3% in fourth quarter 2012 versus 40.7% in fourth quarter 2011. Full year margins were 39.8%, flat with 2011. We continue to see a mix shift that impacts margins, as our faster-growing businesses have not yet scaled to the margins of our more mature businesses.", "In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 55.4% versus 51.7% in fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year, Risk Assessment margins were 54.6%, up from 51% in the prior year. We benefited by about 180 bps in the margin due to the lower pension costs related to the freeze of our plan.", "Our business continues to show scalable profitability, but we also continue to invest in developing new solutions. We continue to see opportunities for investing in the future growth. And as you remember, those can create some near-term pressure on margins. In 2013, we expect to invest in remote imagery, in Touchstone, our next-generation platform for catastrophe modeling, and united -- unified healthcare platform and in several interesting data initiatives.", "We expect that these investments, which will be primarily reflected in the Decision Analytics segment, will be weighted more towards the first 2 quarters of 2013 and could impact the P&L in those periods by about $10 million to $15 million in total, which would also have some impact on lowering margins. However, these are very positive long-term initiatives, and rest assured, we're very happy to be able to invest behind these promising opportunities because they'll ultimately grow EBITDA and cash flow over the long term. We expect our corporate margins will be impacted more modestly, if at all, for full year 2013, as our incremental EBIT margins from existing solutions offset investment.", "Our interest expense was $5.9 million in the fourth quarter and $18.7 million for the full year versus their respective periods in 2011. This increase was due to the higher debt balances related to our acquisitions. We ended fourth quarter with a total debt of $1.5 billion and had repaid all but $10 million of our revolver borrowings.", "Our reported effective tax rate was 29% for the quarter and 36.6% for the full year. We have been actively working on our tax planning strategies and were rewarded by the benefits resulting from this effort. The lower tax rate in the quarter contributed about $0.07 to EPS. And we received a favorable state private letter ruling, which contributed about $0.04 in EPS for prior years and about $0.01 for 2012. We do expect this ruling to reduce our taxes in 2013 and future years by about $2 million annually. We also saw another $0.02 one-time benefit due to additional successful tax initiatives. For 2013, as we think about the tax rate, around 38% seems to be the right level for use in your models.", "Coming down to the net income line. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense less the income tax impact on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 27.1% to $108.7 million for the quarter. Full year adjusted net income grew 19% to $361.3 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.63 for the quarter, an increase of 26%. This included about 7% -- $0.07 related to the tax benefit discussed earlier. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.10, up 20% from 2011.", "The average diluted share count was 171.9 million shares in the quarter and 171.7 million shares for the full year. On December 31, 2012, our diluted share count was 172.2 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased about 715,000 shares for $34.8 million. For fiscal year 2012, we repurchased 3.5 million shares for $162.6 million, an average price of $46.57.", "At quarter end, we had about $144 million left under our authorization. As we discussed the last couple of quarters, we moderated our buyback program after acquiring Argus to ensure we meet our deleveraging commitments. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of about 25%. For 2013, we anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution.", "Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, our cash and cash equivalents was about $90 million. Total debt, both short term and long term, totaled $1.5 billion, reflecting debts borrowed to fund the Argus acquisition, which closed on August 31. Today, our incremental debt capacity is over $800 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Also in December 2012, we made a purchase for $27 million of technology and service application, underlying a long-standing product, as our agreement with a vendor came to an end.", "I'm pleased to report that our debt to pro forma EBITDA at December 31 was 2x, reaching our steady-state leverage rate well ahead of our stated goal of second half of 2013. This is down for the pro forma ratio of 2.35x at the time of the Argus acquisition. As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly.", "Free cash flow in 2012, which we define as cash from operations plus capital expenditures, was $388.5 million, an increase of about $81.1 million, or 26.4% versus 2011. This increase was despite the funding of our pension, which we have mentioned previously. Excluding the impact of our pension funding, net of tax benefit and certain year-over-year timing items, our free cash flow is up about 19%. Our capital expenditures were about 5.2% of revenue for full year 2012. Free cash flow represented 55.8% of EBITDA for 2012, reflecting improved conversion rate compared to the 51.8% in 2011, despite the $72 million pension funding.", "As we think about capital spending for 2013, we're expecting $115 million for the full year. This includes the capital related to some of the initiatives I discussed earlier, as well as the consolidation of our data centers into 2 primary locations. The special projects are approximately $20 million of that total capital spend. So you would see the steady-state CapEx closer to $95 million in 2013. Overall, our business is performing very well, and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and continue to invest in the future.", "With that, I will ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Congratulations, Scott. Within Decision Analytics, the healthcare organic growth was significantly higher for the fourth quarter than what would have been implied by your outlook on the third quarter call. What differed from your expectations from late October, early November? And is the rate of growth we saw in the fourth quarter sustainable going forward?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "This is Mark. Let me just give you a quick overview. I mean, I think we continue to feel very optimistic about healthcare. It's a combination of new customers, as well as growth and penetration within existing. So as we think about the overall health of healthcare, seeing a combination, both increased penetration as well as new, is healthy and reassuring. So all I could tell you with regard to the interpretation from the quarter is I think what we try to do is be realistic, and our healthcare assets continue to perform very well.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I see. And then just a follow-up, Mark, related to your comments regarding pension expense. You called out a $13 million reduction for 2012. What should we expect for 2013 and beyond? Is pension expense going to come down again this year?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So what we did back on March 1, 2012, we froze our pension. So that was really kind of a one-time decline because we now have, in essence -- I don't want to say off our books, but the actual increased liability is gone. So we should find steady state into the future as long as discount rates remain relatively unchanged and the stock market doesn't do anything wild that would affect our asset value. So I would suggest basically flat into the future.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I see. And then you called out a modest increase in 2013 invoices for Risk Assessment. Can you bracket what modest means from a pricing standpoint this year?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Well, I think what we've always tried to do is really focus on our insurance customers as a whole. And we don't want to think of Risk Assessment industry standard as a silo. So we've commented on kind of inflationary type of increases there with a focus more on the overall insurance customer and growth there. And I think we do anticipate increasing growth or increasing organic growth in insurance across the board. But I wouldn't attach too much to the Risk Assessment [indiscernible].", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Just a final housekeeping question. You called out a 38% tax rate assumption for 2013, which would be up from the 36.6% last year, despite the tax benefit you expect this year. So I'm curious, why would the tax rate go up, given the tax benefits that you're seeing in 2013?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yes. So what we try to call out and identify is some of that tax planning strategy had the benefit of a lookback. So we gained some benefit looking back from 2007 to 2011, and we got to pick that up in the quarter, and we get about a $2 million benefit going forward. So what you see is the normalization of that amount. And the lookback is about $0.04, if that helps you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Mark, just to clarify, did you make some comments about full year reported healthcare revenue growth? I think I may have missed what you said.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So full year 2012?", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "'13. Sorry, looking forward.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "I think we feel -- again, feel the opportunity is promising. We feel good about the growth there. But I don't think we're going to give any specific numbers around healthcare.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I wasn't sure if you had specifically quantified anything. And with regard to the investments in Decision Analytics in 2013, you mentioned they're kind of front end-loaded. So I guess, this is kind of a two-pronged question. Should they be somewhat linear in the first couple quarters? And then Scott, how long do you think the payback is on some of these initiatives? Because it seems like this is the first time you're calling out and specifically quantifying investments in specific initiatives and really giving us a clear sense of timing and magnitude.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. So let me ask Mark to just address the pace of the investments, and then I'll come back and talk background and talk about payback.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yes. I think one of the things that we feel good about is as we look for innovation across our businesses, we've had people step up with some interesting opportunities. So we obviously want to invest quickly around good long-term prospects. I would tell you that it's probably a little bit more first quarter than second quarter but not by much.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. And with respect to payback, you have to differentiate among the things that we're talking about. So some of them are for efficiency. And those are going to kick in relatively sooner. So for example, the consolidation of our data centers down to 2 primary data centers is the kind of thing that should be paying off even as we do it. So that's a '13, '14 kind of an item. Some of the things we're doing that are essentially clipping more value into existing product platforms should also have relatively faster paybacks. I mentioned in my remarks upfront, making use of remote imagery. Basically, what we're doing is bringing more data into existing solutions, data which our customers have very clearly indicated they'd like access to. So again, there, you've got categories where the paybacks are pretty quick. Some of the other things we're doing are kind of replatforming existing solutions, where we're creating a much more comprehensive environment in which our customers can do their work, their decisioning work. And those are going to be a little bit longer. Those might be more kind of 3-ish, 5-year kind of windows even though benefits will start to occur closer to today. But the profile of the revenue is probably going to be a little bit further out. In all cases, we think we're talking about very strong value propositions. And I just want to comment on, again kind of following up what both Frank and Mark said, I mean, it's really great, actually, the fact that our existing businesses are generating these very substantial organic growth opportunities. I mean, it's coming from within the businesses. We're definitely asking for investment. We're definitely asking for emphasis on growth and organic growth. But it's really encouraging to see the quality of the thinking and the scale of the opportunities that's coming from our existing units.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And one last one, if I may. Should we expect to see the insurance theme within Decision Analytics bounce back into double-digit organic revenue growth in '13, all else being equal?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So let me -- I'm not sure I'm going to quantify, but let me qualify it. I think we are feeling good about an increased level of organic growth in insurance across the board. So I'm talking about both the Risk Assessment, as well as the category of insurance inside of Decision Analytics. So I think the answer is yes to your question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Could you help us -- or just remind us again the potential runoff you talked about in Q3 for your mortgage business? And then within the forensic piece, can you help us understand the nature of those contracts? Are they multiyear deals?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure. So let me first talk about the mortgage question. When we last got together, I think what we were talking about was 2 things. On the front end, where we talked about underwriting and kind of the analytics focused on applications, that's both refinances and originations, we continue to grow nicely and really kind of ahead of market trends. On the back end, we continue to see a more than offsetting dropoff. And at third quarter, we had talked about potentially the full year being down as much as 12% to 15%. And I think we came in at about 11%. So just to look back, one of the things that we benefited from and now kind of seeing the downside from was in that forensic review. As all these defaults hit the industry, people started to use our services in a material way. Remember, using our services helps a mortgage insurer, as an example, rescind coverage and push back that obligation to the lender. The business, when we bought it, was rather small. And it grew nicely during a time. And we've kind of gotten back to the point where we said it went up dramatically and it's kind of coming down. And we just tried to quantify what the back end looked like. So we kind of gave a range as to how big that drop could be. And that kind of is consistent with what we continue and what we've said even into '13, where we said that it could be down as much as 11% again. I think the second part of your question was about the contracts?", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Right.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Here, it's a little bit different. It's more transactional. So you do contract for multiyears with either a mortgage lender or a mortgage insurer. And you get integrated, so you're tightly integrated, you're tightly embedded inside their processes, but it is transactional. So there's no guaranteed minimums. There's nothing that would guarantee an amount. It's just you're the source when they choose to run that type of analytic.", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just back on the mortgage runoff again. I mean, if you were down like you projected, 11% in '13, would you kind of be back to that rate before you saw the spike in activity?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "I would need to actually kind of work through the details, but I believe that we're getting back to that normalized level, maybe a little bit. We're still above where we were back at that day because we've grown the business, we have more customers. One thing I want to let you know, and we've talked about this, is we used to have what was a couple very big and concentrated customers. The level and nature of the solutions now is much more spread across customers and products. So the quality of the revenue is improved, as we think about kind of into the future.", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Then finally, just on the overall margin. You talked about the investment in Decision Analytics in the first half. But then it may not have much of an overall impact to the overall margin. Is it fair to kind of assume a flattish type margin for '13 overall for the corporate EBITDA margin?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "I think we try not to give real specifics. But I think there is probably -- I think we've tried to talk about the investment kind of offsetting the scale, so I think we should be around there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Raymond James.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "First of all, congratulations to Scott on the promotion to CEO. And then also congratulations to Frank on taking Verisk from a monoline private company to a diversified $9 billion public company.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Thanks, Bill. I had a lot of help.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Now there's been talk in the industry about you guys developing an all-claims fraud database for healthcare similar to the ISO Claims database for insurance. And I'd like to ask if you could give us some color on that and also some thoughts on that opportunity in healthcare versus insurance.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "So we are working on that. It's extremely important for us in the healthcare space. And it's not something that actually we're going to put a lot out in the public about right now, Bill, because it's a very critical thing that we're doing and it's very proprietary to us. I will say that it builds upon 2 strengths that we've got inside of the company. One is the fact that we already aggregate claims data on the P&C side, so there's a methodology there that we can reference. And secondly, we're already aggregating medical claims in the P&C domain. And it's really quite obvious that streaming together medical claims from the P&C domain with the formal healthcare space is actually a very powerful thing to do that has not been done before. With respect to who it is that's coming into our approach and the rate at which they're coming into our approach, I mean, that really is kind of -- we're right in the middle of all that, Bill. And we're really not sharing very many -- we're not sharing very much about that right now because it is so critical and sensitive. But I will say that it is an idea that seems intuitive for the healthcare space.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then of course, I couldn't not ask a question correlated to mortgage. So I just wanted to ask one of the clarifying question on 2013, when we talk about the 11% decline. That's for the combined forensic and origination, is that?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "That's correct.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "That's correct.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Correct, okay. And then for the -- your thoughts in terms of your ability to offset the decline in the forensic piece with increased penetration on the front end.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, I mean, basically, the work that we're doing is to look at all of the lines of service that we provide and to think about which of them are most valuable to our customers and which of them can be [indiscernible] the most. And actually, there are some lines of service that haven't even really been much a part of the business previously than in 2013, we're going -- we expect to do some merging. So it's even a little more nuanced, Bill, than just front and back end. It's also sort of multiple ways in which we can serve the originator.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then one housekeeping question, just the share count exiting the quarter.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "I think, exiting the quarter, give me one second, Bill, I referenced it. I want to just get you [indiscernible]. So exiting the quarter, we had 172.2 million shares.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "First, I wanted to ask about the catastrophe modeling. Can you elaborate a little more on the strength there? And how sustainable is that as we go into next year? I imagine the comps are much tougher after the improvement you've seen this year.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I didn't actually understand the point you were making there at the end about the comps.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just the comparison. I mean, it's had such a strong year. Can you continue to grow on top of that?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Okay. Within our own experience. All right. I thought maybe you were referencing the market. Yes, catastrophe modeling is a very important discipline inside of the P&C space, and it is going to remain one. There, something to understand about it is that there are multiple ways that, that set of services grows. One way is by modeling new combinations of perils and geographies. And it's -- we're considerably far away from all perils and all meaningful geographies being modeled. And so there's growth there. One of the investments we're making to replatform what we do is actually inside of what we do on the catastrophe modeling side. And fundamentally, what that's about is taking the discipline from being aimed at making portfolio kinds of decisions, carriers working on their reinsurance with their reinsurers and vice versa. All of that will continue to be the case. But it's also about taking the same modeling capabilities and actually applying them on a risk-by-risk basis in the underwriting process for the primary carrier. And that also is going to represent some growth. And so there are just a number of things which are involved in it. And I just want to help everybody to understand that it's actually a very multidimensional thing that goes on there. And so we really believe that it is a -- it's a category with legs over a long period of time. And we believe that we have a very leading position. You may have noticed that we had a very, very disproportionately high share of all the cat bond issuances in 2012. We think that in many ways, that's the purest form of competition in the cat modeling space, representative of who has the best science and technology.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then Argus, can you talk about it? It seems like just even on a sequential and year-over-year basis, at least what I can back into in the run rate of revenue for that business, seems like it picked up a fair amount this past quarter, or at least it was better than I expected. Is that -- is there anything special going on there? Or was it just kind of the ongoing growth of that business?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "You want to go ahead, Mark?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Well, let me just -- I think what we've seen is -- let's do full year, I'll go kind of a pro forma basis. I think we saw greater than 20% growth at Argus. I think we see them delivering. And you're right, the actual results for the 4 months that we own them was greater than what we originally advised. Scott, let me turn it back over to you.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. Just, it's a kind of -- I'm going to almost repeat myself what I was saying about cat modeling. What Argus does is multidimensional, and it's important that you understand that. So the business has historically been aimed at aggregating data to understand the credit card product line. There's a big opportunity to try to understand demand deposits and other products which come from the retail banks. There's a geographic expansion dimension. And then there's also moving from focusing primarily on product design and pricing considerations also to --  because of the data that are a part of what the supply that Argus receives, there's also a big opportunity to move into looking at issues of fraud. And so again, please just understand it as being very multidimensional. And essentially, what's going on is a number of those themes are active. They were active in the fourth quarter of 2012, and they'll remain active going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to talk about the status of the unified healthcare technology platform. What has been accomplished? What still has to be accomplished? And how does that lift healthcare organic growth?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. So it's something that we're very focused on. We review this very routinely with the business unit, and we're pleased with where we stand overall. We have customers who are live, being served with the unified platform, powering our solutions on the back end. That is particularly true in the payment accuracy part of what it is that we do. Next up, and importantly for us, is having the same unified platform hooked up to and supporting our solutions in the Enterprise Analytics division of what it is that we do. Ultimately, it will be all of Verisk Health. But Enterprise Analytics is up next, and that's a 2013 deliverable, so -- and where we have activated customers against the platform, we and they have both been very, very pleased with the result.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And it lifts revenues when you do that, right?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Say again?", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Does it affect revenues?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. I mean, the primary benefit of what we're doing there is that we create access to our data stores for all of our existing solutions, as well as the next one that we develop. And because of that, in effect, what we'll be able to do is to say to an existing customer -- and I think you all know how important cross-selling is to our growth. What we'll be able to say to an existing healthcare customer is, \"Because you're already contributing data, you're essentially already in our environment.\" So if you want to turn on another solution, the cost and time to do that is extremely negligible. And we believe that, that's going to help accelerate cross-selling.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Congrats to Scott and Frank, as well. Just a quick follow-up on the Argus side. I guess, you gave us sort of what the pro forma full year revenue looked like. Can you maybe give us some color on how the margins performed there? I think you had given us the first half margins at the time of the acquisition. Was it somewhat similar to that, better? Any color on that front?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yes. I mean, the margins that you saw in the first half, or what we did as part of our filing, that continued into the 4 months where we owned. And I think we -- I think very similar to a lot of the Verisk products, that you have a wonderful brand with some real value add to the customers that will ultimately provide leverage and scale as it grows. So we feel good about the margins then. They are very strong and consistent to what you saw in the first half.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got it. And is Argus, I guess, for the early stages, I think as you discussed some acquisitions, still is roughly going to be -- I guess, the way to put it is more a stand-alone company? Like is there -- I was thinking -- trying to think looking forward, are there any cross-sell opportunities between Argus and the rest of the businesses?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "It is more stand-alone, though it's not entirely stand-alone for a couple of reasons. One is, we are, at the enterprise level, looking to integrate substantially all of our data assets. And so what we should have the opportunity to do then is to make observations about consumer credit, consumer demand deposits, the personal line side of the insurance space, even potentially healthcare, make integrated observations in order to, for example, do an even more comprehensive job of rooting out fraud. And so I think Argus has a big data shop in and of itself, has something powerful to contribute on that front. And then I would also say that we are certainly exploring maybe individual product level opportunities, where Argus observations about consumers might be able to be tied into work that we're doing, particularly on the P&C side as it relates to fraud findings. But the shape of the P&L, I think, will be substantially based upon the customers and the product sets that Argus has.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got it. And Mark, if I may, on the mortgage side, what sort of origination estimate are you using for the market in your numbers?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So we're looking back. We typically focus on the MBA forecast, Mortgage Bankers Association forecast. Is that was your question is, I'll make sure.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Yes. No, fair enough. So that's what's baked in. And I guess, just related to that in terms of the overall segment, just your thoughts on sort of strategically, it seems like that's the least set of all the businesses and it has been a drag for a couple of years now on overall growth. Just strategically, how you view that unit?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, I'll say a couple things. The first one is that we apply ourselves to making the mortgage business a distinctive Verisk-like business, just as we do with everything we do, which means always trying to infuse it with higher-level analytics, with more proprietary data and a robust stream of new solutions. So we don't take any different approach in terms of the running of the business nor will we take a different approach. What I would also say is that we're just always alert to thinking about the shape of our whole portfolio. We try not to think of anything as being sacred but always putting things to the test of: Is there value? Is there increasing value? What's the nature of the external market that we face, et cetera? So in that sense, mortgage is always being reviewed in the same way that the whole business is always being reviewed. And we don't ever turn off that part of the thought process.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "First question relates to your comments about industry-standard business, Risk Assessment overall as well. I just want to clarify what you said because, Mark, some of your comments tailed off a bit at the end. Are you saying you expect growth for industry standard to accelerate in 2013 at kind of an inflationary rate, which would mean a few hundred basis points of acceleration would be reasonable? I mean, I know you don't want to give guidance, but pulling together everything that you said, is that kind of the right picture?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "No. Let me just make sure. I'll say it again. I said that we expected the industry-standard program, the invoices are out, and they grew at an inflationary pace. There was an increase. It was an increase, just inflationary kind of similar path. The point that I was making was that we just don't look at industry-standard programs as a silo. What we're interested in doing is making sure we sell more to and grow our relationship broadly across Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics to our insurance customers. And we do see an increase in growth rate across the total relationship as we think about '13.", "Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then another question I have that relates to G&A and it ties in your comments about investments. Another way to look at this, your G&A was down a couple million sequentially. First of all, why was that? And how should we think about that line item in the model next year as we layer in investments?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Well, I think one thing you do need to factor into this is the pension freeze that we talked about, the $13 million, is a combination of cost of goods because there's people working on product. But it's also about the people that are providing support functions. And remember, if you think about pension, a lot of those people are, in fact, retired. So that affects the SG&A number also. I would generally expect SG&A to grow slightly slower than the top line. We would expect leverage and scale there.", "Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And then for Argus, I know we've touched on it a couple times in the call. But just to ensure accuracy, I mean, can you actually give us the revenue number that Argus generated in the quarter?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "I think that is...", "Eva F. Huston", "Kelly, it's Eva. You can parse that out of the K. Let me just give you the specific number. I'm just getting to the right page. $16.7 million in the fourth quarter.", "Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I might be able to calculate this, too, but I'm not positive. The -- as far as the growth rate, the pro forma growth rate for Argus, I think you just said a few questions back, Mark, it was more than 20%.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "That's correct for '12.", "Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Are we able to get any more detail on that? I mean, was it -- can you give us the exact number? Or can we calculate it from what you've disclosed?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "I mean, I think it's a little bit above 20%. I think what we did -- said at the time of the acquisition, that we kind of saw mid-teens growth in the future. We still feel good about that.", "Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. So when you say above 20%, it's close to 20%. It's not like above 20%, could be 40% or anything like that?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "I think that's right, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Suzanne Stein from Morgan Stanley.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Brian [ph] in for Suzi. Do you have any sort of government exposure? And is sequestration at all an issue here?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes, not very much at all. Very, very de minimis. And the effect would be just negligible on the P&L, if it did occur, I mean, we -- mostly through our weather-related analytics, we do a fair amount of work on Earth-orbiting satellites, et cetera. Apparently, these are more considered to be critical programs. But the real point is just the absolute amount of business we do there is so small that it just won't have much of an effect.", "Unknown Analyst", "Got it. And just from an pipeline -- from an acquisition pipeline standpoint, can you comment generally on any sort of plans for increased activity in healthcare or any other verticals that you may be kind of focusing on?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, we remain very active in the marketplace overall. Our team is constantly proactively engaging with companies that potentially fit with our strategy. Absolutely no difference in approach from where we've been for years and years and years now. Just a general point I would make is that as we have diversified our business, as we've moved into new market segments, et cetera, we've just given ourselves a broader playing field. And we're just going to continue to pursue it. You've seen a fair amount of M&A activity in the healthcare space from us. And there's certainly no reason to expect that, that would change. But we're -- we've got our headlights out there against the whole business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "It's such an exciting time for the company, Frank and Scott. I wanted to follow up on some of your preliminary comments about the N+1 initiative that you made at the outset. Just I know you're going to go into this in more detail next week, but if you could just share with us in a minute or so, what specific end markets you envision addressing with those initiatives.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, we've talked a lot about the fact that we feel the need to be very deep in whatever vertical markets we're serving because it is really, really important that we be intimate with our customers. In fact, we can't even -- N+1, as it relates to our data sets, is interpreted in several ways. It means that we're one layer further than our competitors. It means that we're one layer further than any one customer. It means that we're one layer further than the data assets that we've got today in terms of what we're building towards in the future. So it's a lot of -- it has a lot of different dimensions to it like that. Unless we are intimate with our customers, we don't actually know what N is, so we don't know that we're at the N+1 level. And so that's just by way of saying that we are in 4 domains right now, as you know: the P&C market, the healthcare market, supply chain and financial services. And we'll talk about this more at Investor Day. But we've got plenty of distance to run inside of those marketplaces. And we would not claim that we've achieved the very greatest amount of intimacy that we can with all of our customers. That's good work that we're still engaged in. So that's all by way of saying that while we're always asking questions about the shape of the business and where are we in terms of the markets that we serve, we have a great deal of focus on going further inside of the segments that we already serve. And I think you can expect to continue to see that from us.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. Thank you for that context. And then I have some pension-related question maybe for Mark or Eva. With regards to the pension, just so I understand, that -- the freeze is on current. Or is it current or new employees where the pension -- the movement in the pension is accruing?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So just to give you a feel. We've gone through a couple reiteration [ph] of freezes. But back in March, that was put in place across the entire Verisk enterprise. So there's nobody accruing any additional benefit related to pension. Obviously, what anybody earned in the past is obviously theirs, but there's no more benefit accruing.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. So should we expect significant movement in 2013 as we had in 2012?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So no, what happens is we receive the benefit and what we would expect now is it would be generally flat going forward, as long as discount rates and market results or how the assets are invested don't change materially. So we would expect a flatness to that cost, which is negligible these days.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Mark, just a quick follow-up. On that lower tax rate for '13, is that something that's sustainable going forward? Or should we expect the tax rate to kind of move back up again?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "No. We feel that, that is a sustainable rate in light of these tax planning strategies we've taken on.", "Operator", "And this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Frank Coyne.", "Frank J. Coyne", "Yes. Thank you. And thanks to all for joining us today for our fourth quarter results. We appreciate your support, and I thank you for helping Verisk reach its current stature in the public market. This will be my last earnings call as I transition to solely a board role effective April 1. It has been an honor to serve our 6,000 employees, our customers and our investors as CEO, and I look forward to continuing to be a part of Verisk through my role as Chairman.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.", "Eva F. Huston", "Thank you, Christie. And good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions.", "The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until May 30, 2013, on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you, Eva, and good morning to everyone. In the first quarter of 2013, we delivered strong overall performance, with total revenue growth of over 16% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 13%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the first quarter was 6.8%. Our organic revenue growth was 9.5% in the first quarter, excluding our mortgage analytics business, which continues to face some macro challenges, as we've discussed with you before. Profitability was strong, with an EBITDA margin of over 44% in the quarter, even while we continued to invest in innovation, as we signaled to you last quarter. Our free cash flow growth, adjusted for the timing of a tax benefit that Mark will describe later, was also strong, increasing over 14% in the quarter.", "We remain disciplined in our use of capital and we're focused on delivering shareholder returns. We returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases in this quarter of about $22 million. We remain active and disciplined in looking at M&A. We focus on assets with a genuine strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects. Last year, as you know, we spent about $800 million on acquisitions, principally for MediConnect and Argus, and we remain very pleased with last year's acquisitions, both from a strategic as well as a performance perspective.", "With those high-level results as background, let me just say I'm pleased to continue speaking with you about our strategy, as I've done since our IPO in 2009, but now from the CEO's seat. We will build on the strong platform developed and led for over a decade by Frank Coyne, who I'm delighted to say, remains with us as the Chairman of our board. These are exciting times for Verisk and our over 6,000 employees who have the task, every day, of creating value for our customers, and as a result, for our shareholders. I hope that a lot of you were able to attend or listen to our Investor Day presentations in March, where we shared with you the deep industry expertise and the innovative solutions that we deliver daily.", "As we've done for many years on our journey, we will continue to emphasize 4 things: first, looking for proprietary data sets and analytic methods; second, developing scalable industry-standard solutions; third, repurposing our intellectual property assets for enhanced value for both existing as well as new customers; and fourth, thinking with what we called the N+1 mindset.", "We continue to focus on investment opportunities and we're encouraged -- encouraging our teams to bring more forward. As we've discussed, we are funding a number of initiatives in 2013 and we plan to continue to do so into the future. Our list of investment initiatives in 2013 is very exciting and includes: remote imagery; Touchstone, which is our next-generation platform for catastrophe modeling; the unified health care platform and health care data aggregation; and supply chain innovations. Combining the power of analytics with the creativity of all of our team members, we intend to build on the strong financial results we delivered this quarter. The ongoing experience, knowledge and dedication of our employees across our enterprise positions us well for the rest of 2013.", "So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Thank you, Scott. We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter, in which we delivered both growth and profitability while also investing and planning for the future. In the first quarter, total revenue grew 16.4% and organic revenue growth, 6.8%. The results reflect continued exceptional revenue performance in health care, even as we cycle past strength from 2012, and good revenue growth in our current solutions.", "Mortgage revenue growth remained a headwind to overall growth. Excluding our mortgage analytics business, organic revenue growth in the quarter was 9.5%. In the first quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 24.4% revenue growth, of which 7.8% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of MediConnect, Argus and Aspect. Next quarter, MediConnect will be part of the organic revenue growth in the health care category.", "Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 8.8% in the first quarter and 8.3% organically, excluding the acquisition of Aspect. Our underwriting solutions delivered strong growth and we saw continued double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter. Our claims solutions, which are well penetrated, also contributed to growth. We continue to innovate in these areas, as well as others, to add to the growth.", "In financial services, which includes both Argus and the mortgage analytics business, revenue grew 28.1% in the quarter. Argus is an excellent business, performing very well since the acquisition in third quarter of 2012. Argus is on track to deliver at least mid-teens growth in 2013, as discussed at the time of the acquisition. The mortgage portion of the financial services revenue declined 19.1% in the first quarter. Within our mortgage tools area, we are seeing recent trends continuing. Our origination-related revenue continues to grow, while our mortgage revenue declined due to the ongoing normalization of the forensic piece of the business.", "In thinking about the mortgage portion of financial services for 2013, we continue to believe the full year 2013 results may mirror the revenue decline of about 11% we saw in the full year 2012. Health care continues to deliver exceptional revenue growth, 93.9% total revenue growth for the first quarter and organic revenue growth of 39%, which exceeded our expectations. Our total revenue growth benefited from the second quarter 2012 addition of MediConnect, another acquisition that has performed strongly. The performance to date continues to validate our strategy of combining our revenue integrity and HEDIS reporting businesses with MediConnect to create a comprehensive solution, which we call Revenue and Quality Intelligence, or RQI.", "Organically, we continue to add and implement new customers and expand our relationships with continuing customers. I think you got a great feel for the strength of the health care opportunity and the growth prospects at our Investor Day in March. We remain excited about the opportunity. We expect growth to remain well above corporate average from an organic perspective, but percentages, naturally, will be impacted as we grow off of a larger base.", "Our specialized markets revenue grew 3.6% in the first quarter, with modest growth from our weather and climate analytics, and from our supply chain solutions due to lower growth from government contracts and customer projects.", "Turning to Risk Assessment. For the first quarter, we reported revenue growth of 5.3%, maintaining the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting our 2013 invoices, which were effective January 1. Excluding about $1 million of nonrecurring license fee revenue in first quarter of 2012, which we discussed last year, industry-standard growth would have been about 4.4%. As a reminder, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had included the actuarial services and statistical agency services categories as part of industry-standard programs.", "Our property-specific information revenue increased 11.1% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales and higher volumes from certain customers, as well as the incremental revenue contributions due to the expiration of our revenue-sharing agreement with a technology provider in the fourth quarter 2012.", "EBITDA for the first quarter was $179.7 million, as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 12.6% for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 44.6%, reflecting good expense management, even as we invested in our businesses, as previously discussed. Additionally in the quarter, acquisitions mitigated the reported consolidated margin by about 100 basis points. As you know, we have an ESOP in place, which is approaching its final distribution date of December 2013. We are evaluating the potential for extending the ESOP. If we choose not to do so, we could expect to see a noncash charge of up to $27 million in the year, dependent upon the Verisk stock price. In that case, we could also report an adjusted EBIT number, as you have seen us do in the past, to help you better understand the underlying performance of the business.", "The margins in Decision Analytics were 37.3% in the first quarter of 2013 versus 39.3% in first quarter of 2012. We continue to see a mix shift that impacts margins, as our faster growing businesses, like health care, have not yet scaled to the margins of the more mature businesses. In addition, the margin in the quarter reflects some of the investments that we've previously outlined. We remain very comfortable with the modest near-term margin impact when we see the opportunity to drive faster and sustainable top line growth into the future.", "In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 56.4% versus 55.4% first quarter of 2012. Our business continues to show scalable profitability, even while we continue to invest in developing new solutions. Also, please recall, our invoices in those increases are generally effective first quarter, and our employee compensation increases begin their impact in the second quarter, leading to higher margins in first quarter relative to second.", "As noted last quarter, we expect our investments, which are primarily reflected in the Decision Analytics segments, to be weighted more towards the first half of 2013, and could impact the P&L by about $10 million to $15 million in total, which should have the impact of lowering margins. Our investments are in the combination of people, data, hardware and software, some of which flow through the P&L, but some through the balance sheet as CapEx. As you know, our forecast is about $115 million in CapEx for 2013, including about $20 million related to these investments initiatives.", "We expect our corporate margin will be impacted by modest full year 2013, as our incremental EBITDA margins from existing solutions offset debt. Our interest expense is $3.7 million for the first quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This increase was due to the higher debt balances taken on during 2012 related to our acquisitions. We ended first quarter with total debt of about $1.5 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. Our reported tax rate was 36.7% for the quarter. As discussed last quarter, we've been actively working on our tax planning strategies and were rewarded by the benefits resulting from this effort, as well as an R&D tax credit that benefited us in the first quarter. For 2013, the tax rate will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter, however, 38% still seems to be about the right level for your models, perhaps, with a modest bias to a slightly lower rate for the full year.", "Coming down to the net income line. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 14.3% to $91.2 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.53 for the quarter, an increase of 12.8%. The average diluted share count was 172.8 million shares for the quarter. On March 31, 2013, our diluted share count was 173.1 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased about 382,000 shares for about $21.5 million. At quarter end, we had about $122.7 million left under our authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generalizing annualized IRRs of over 20%. For 2013, we continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution.", "Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, our cash and cash equivalents were $276 million. Total debt, both the short-term and long-term, totaled $1.5 billion. Today, our total incremental debt capacity is over $850 million and will grow with our EBITDA and cash flow. Our debt to pro forma EBITDA at March 31 was 2x, at our steady-state target. As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities, because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly, as we've demonstrated since our acquisition of Argus in third quarter of 2012.", "In the first quarter, free cash flow, which we've define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $162.7 million, a decrease of about $10.9 million or 6.3% versus the first quarter of 2012. Adjusting for the timing of excess tax benefits in the quarter, free cash flow in the quarter was $198.9 million reflecting growth of 14.5% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Our capital expenditures were 7.1% of revenue in the first quarter, consistent with the incremental investments we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow representing 90.6% of EBITDA for first quarter of 2013, reflecting our strong first quarter cash flow generation based upon the timing of our customer invoice payments. Adjusting for the timing of the excess tax benefit we mentioned previously, free cash flow represented over 100% of EBITDA.", "As we think about capital spending for 2013, we're still expecting $115 million for the full year, including this $20 million of investment initiative spending. As you think about your models for the full year 2013, we anticipate amortization of intangible assets of about $64 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $74 million, and a tax rate of about 38%, with a modest downward bias. We aim to keep share counts flat through our share repurchase program. Overall, our business is performing very well. We have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals, and we continue to invest for the future.", "With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just on the health care side, obviously, you've continued excellent performance, as you talked about, and I think you had mentioned that it definitely delivered some growth better than your internal expectations. I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on where they'd be relative to what you guys were expecting? And also, I think you made a comment on sort of health care as one of the segments that hasn't yet scaled to company margins. Just thinking long term, like, how long and what sort of scale do you anticipate to get before it does get to those set of margins?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "To your question, the first part, we -- we're actually very pleased with how the different segments of the business are performing, overall. We see them all as very important to our future opportunities in the vertical. So it's not so much any one segment, and, as I think you all know, we're working very hard, actually, to find a way to pull together our data assets so that we can -- into a unified platforms, so that we can actually create even more value. And that capability is going to underpin all of our segments going forward. In terms of the scalability of the business, I mean, you really said it. We haven't yet arrived at a point where the business is fully scaled. Yet, it's coming along nicely. And we see this as a long-term journey as we continue to try to establish leadership inside of the category. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "No. I think, you're right on. I mean, it's really about life cycle of products. So there's some mature products inside the insurance space, as an example, but we've kind of achieved some relatively high margins. Health care, I think, we scale in each passing quarter. And each passing year, we expect to continue to move along that journey. There's probably some stronger competition in health care than in some of the insurance places where we compete, so that also factors into this space.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then, if I could just ask one more around if you could give a little more color on just what you guys see as your acquisition pipeline? I mean, you guys obviously have a pretty healthy cash balance right now. It seems like one of the highest in a while. What sort of activity is going on in the back end? Any -- just some color around that?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "We are as active as we've ever been. And we are always proceeding from our strategy as it relates to the M&A agenda. So our case is not really founded so much on sort of the M&A climate overall. It's much more we are proactively in the market, creating relationship and suggesting opportunities. And we continue to find that we have a very high success rate in terms of engaging with companies that -- where there's at least a belief that there may be a strategic fit. So the work of the team continues just as it has. I think we said to you in the past that we certainly see health care as one of the places where we certainly anticipate additional M&A activity. And the work we're doing right now is very consistent with that. So it's really the same picture as it's always been.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "First, I want to just ask broadly about the insurance vertical. I know they're not as much your expectations, but I think some people were hoping this year that kind of the lag impact is insurance premiums going up, as well as maybe some easier weather-related comps would help drive a pickup in the growth rate of that business. And it's more so steady right now, I guess, as we look at the numbers. Is it -- I guess, just trying to get your sense, is that -- is the business performing as you would have expected or were you hope -- is there any hope for kind of a pickup in the growth rate this year, because of those factors?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, you've got a couple of things in there, Tim. First of all, on balance, we are pleased with where we are in the insurance vertical right now. I just want to stress, as a point that we've made consistently, which is we really see -- so the totality of what we do in the vertical. That is really where our strategy lies. We end up talking about RA and DA, and we're happy to do that. But in reality, the way the business works is that we're trying to knit solutions together. It's also the case at customers look to deal with us with respect to the full suite that we're providing them. So it's an all-in-all, so we're really tracking our performance in the vertical overall. So that said, you've referenced weather-related effects, there actually was quietness. There has been quietness recently. So that does factor in somewhere. But we're really just on the sort of the long march of causing our solutions to be valuable and to be deeply embedded with our customers. The net effect of all of that is we do believe that as 2013 moves forward, that we will see acceleration in the revenue growth rate of the insurance vertical.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, thanks. And then, on MediConnect, as that rolls into the business, I think you described to us that it had a tough comp in the year ago period. I know it's not in your numbers, but if we just look -- backed into what it was. But I guess, just going forward, what kind of underlying organic growth rate, as -- just trying to get a sense, if that gets added into the organic growth rate for health care's, does that enhance it or bring it down? Or is it about the same as the rest of the vertical?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So we don't give specific guidance, but as you correctly observed, the comp was a tough one because of some roll forward in the prior year. We clearly think that the MediConnect inclusion is going to add to the overall corporate organic growth rate. So happy with that, and I also want to just kind of remind you, when we keep talking about the power of the comprehensive solutions in what we're referring to as RQI, although not direct and explicit, the combined power of the MediConnect acquisition with what was a revenue integrity business, has helped us, on the Revenue Integrity, win business. So it's almost starting to contribute before it's calculated in. I think we feel very good about the opportunities in MediConnect, and the opportunities for RQI overall. And as I said, from a high-level corporate perspective, it should definitely add to the full corporate growth.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Scott, from a high-level standpoint, your businesses seem to be all performing pretty well, with the obvious exception of mortgage. And it's been multiple quarters now, at least on the forensic side. Is there -- could you just give us a sense of your strategic thoughts on that business, because there seems to be a disconnect between all of your other assets and mortgage. Do you remain committed to that? What are your thought processes as we enter '13 now?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes, I mean, the context here has to be the seismic changes in the mortgage marketplace that have occurred over the last several years. And so that's just sort of the backdrop here. And distinguish in your thinking between the automated solutions that we provide, which are aimed at supporting the underwriting process, and the forensic solutions that we provide, which are aimed at supporting the resolution of loans, which have apparently gone bad. And those businesses respond to different things that are going on inside of the mortgage vertical. And it's the latter part. It's the forensic piece that has been going through an adjustment as underwriting standards change so much. And as we move through a bubble of a very large volume of loans which were in trouble, as we begin to normalize, the forensic side of that is naturally going to pull back. The automated solutions that we have in support of the origination process, and a suite of other newer solutions that we put together, all of those are actually very promising. And they're doing very well. And we're very excited about the team that we've got that is leading for us there. And so our focus is on making a success out of the parts of that business that naturally represent the greatest growth opportunity going forward, while trying to minimize the impacts of the market adjustment with respect to the volume of forensic activity. And obviously, the net effect of all of that is what you saw in the first quarter. There comes a point where the downward pull of the forensic adjustment is naturally going to work its way through. And our focus is then on a business, at that point, which -- our aim is to see it be advanced, to -- just to run the Verisk playbook, basically. Newer proprietary forms of data, new analytic methods, a deeper reach into that marketplace. So we're dealing -- our team there is dealing with kind of a once-in-an-economic-lifetime adjustment in the marketplace, and I think they've actually done a very fine job in working their way through that.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So your view continues to be that, at some point, as we get through this normalization process, that mortgage could have an organic revenue growth rate that's consistent with the Verisk corporate average?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "That would be our aim.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And one more, if I may. You've talked about the potential for better organic revenue growth and insurance as the year goes along here. I assume that will come mostly from DA. Could you speak specifically about some of the innovations you think that could drive that? Is that part of the early 2013 investment cycle or is this an ongoing process? And is it within your claims solutions set -- subset? Where do you think that pick up might come from?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes, great -- that's a great question. So we're innovating on a number of fronts, but there are a few things that stand up and stand out. First of all, we're very happy with what's going on in our catastrophe modeling business, which continues to demonstrate leadership in all sorts of ways. And it's a very vibrant category, where there are still lots of country-peril combinations to be modeled. And there's a whole new wave of software innovation, which is coming into that business, where we feel that we're at the forefront, we're very happy with that and about all of that. Our underwriting solutions continued to advance very nicely. I think we've described in the past that when you look at the different places where we serve inside of the insurance vertical, we have great strength with respect to the rating, the pricing process for the insurance product, great strength with respect to the claims process and great strength with respect to some of the sort of complex analytics, which wash across all of that, including catastrophe modeling, as I mentioned before, and fraud fighting. In the underwriting category -- so underwriting, not the -- the underwriting, not rating part of the insurance process, we have opportunities to move towards an equivalent leadership position. We're not there today, but we are actually advancing very nicely. And then, some of the investing that we're doing in first half 2013, we hope and expect will be a part of 2013 results towards the back half of the year. We're very excited about opportunities to enhance replacement and repair cost estimating with some new data sets that really haven't been brought into that process before in any measurable way. And so we do expect a contribution from that in the latter half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "About MediConnect, I think it was about $17 million in the quarter, and I wanted you to first remind us of seasonality, recalling that there was a third and fourth quarter seasonality. I believe MediConnect was down about 28%, if my math is right, sequentially. And they just reported first compared to the fourth quarter. I want to know if that is a normal seasonality for MediConnect. And also, if you're willing to, I want to know if you can give us a pro forma year-over-year growth rate for MediConnect as if it was in place a year ago.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So let me answer the question like we have in the past. I think we think of the business as a whole. So let's use health care broadly. It is kind of a 40-60 split, with 40 being the first half, 60 being in the second half of the year and that, kind of including all 3 of those categories with health care. I think, so I guess what I'm trying to focus in on your MediConnect question, just one more time, Andrew, you're talking about growth quarter-to-quarter or are you trying to do year-on-year back in...", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So, Mark, I was a little sneaky. I kind of asked both. My question is first, is the type of sequential decline that I calculated in the first quarter, which was down sequentially about 28% for MediConnect, being $17 million in the quarter, is that a normal sequential decline? Seasonally, I think it might be, but we don't have the history. And then, I said, secondarily, if you were willing to, could you give us a pro forma growth rate for MediConnect year-over-year as if it was in the quarter a year ago.", "Eva F. Huston", "Andrew, it's Eva. I just wanted to jump in on your question of sequential. I think it's hard to look at it that way, because the business overall is growing. And so what the sequential differences between 4Q and 1Q kind of gets blended with the overall growth in the business. So I would encourage you to look at it as sort of the front half, back half as opposed to the sequential. I think that's more logical. We had also talked to you last quarter, reminding you that the Q1 '12 MediConnect number, which I believe was the $17 million to $18 million, included $3 million to $4 million of overflow from Q4 of '11. Remember, we have this nature where our customers try to get stuff done in 3 and 4, but sometimes, it goes into January because of the CMS deadline. So just take those into account when you're thinking about it. And I think if you were to look at the numbers, you can see the growth in Q1. If you adjust for that $3 million to $4 million, you probably have something like a 15% to 20% growth rate.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "And typically, those deadlines for the -- working with CMS is around January 30, and how fast the customers go, whether there's a roll over into the first quarter or everything's done in fourth quarter is sometimes more of a customer-specific requirement.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right. So if you pull it together, you'd say this was normal seasonality for MediConnect, then?", "Eva F. Huston", "Yes, but I wouldn't pin that on the percentage number per se, but yes, the seasonality is normal.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.", "Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Organic growth in specialized markets slipped a little, and you mentioned government as an issue there. Can you talk about how big government is in that segment and what would you expect, as far as organic growth, for the remainder of this year?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "So, Suzi, I thought that we were going to give you specifics -- I think we feel a couple of things. There's 2 businesses that are generally in there. One is more focused on the environmental health and safety. There, I think we continue to feel good about that business, the supply chain, risk management, doing some investing around that. And I think there's some general excitement. That may have just been a little bit more around timing of the customers and use of products. So, nothing to change perspectives relative to what happened last year. Inside the other piece of the business, which is the climate risk portion, where we do work on behalf of and with the government. Two things happening there. First of all, in the quarter, it was more about a government contract that we just had some less volumes, so really more project-oriented from that government. And that's about 40% of the business. I think the second part of the question, just to kind of give you the furlough and the impact of furloughs on that government-related business, could be something that could affect us. The numbers aren't big to progress for the rest of the year. That's the only thing that's a little bit on our mind with regard to growth rates inside that portion of specialized.", "Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Can you give us any more detail on Argus and the performance there? I guess, what's changed either on the revenue or expense side with the company under the Verisk umbrella?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Let me talk about, sort of generally, how it's -- the Argus team and the Argus assets are working into what we're doing at Verisk. We are delighted to have the Verisk (sic) [Argus] team as our partners in Verisk. I would say that, if anything, the -- I would say that the business, its performance and its fit with what we're attempting to accomplish, is even better than we had anticipated and our expectations were pretty strong. The leadership team at Argus is actually already providing leadership broadly inside of Verisk as we work to find opportunities to work across verticals. And we're very encouraged that we've, even in this short period of time since we came together, we've had multiple customers who actually work with Verisk across vertical markets, particularly the insurance and the banking verticals, have actually, specifically, come to us looking for support that we can provide them in optimizing their businesses by taking a look at their books of business across these different categories. And it's just really exciting that the market is responding to what it is that we see there. Specific to Argus as Argus, apart from these opportunities to build in and with the rest of Verisk, the business continues to perform right on top of where we thought it would be.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I think you recently had your annual user conference. Any broad themes you were hearing from your customers, anything that incrementally changes your view, I guess, on the spending environment of your clients?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. We had a really great session. And I think you're thinking about with our P&C customers, we had that customer conference last month. We actually engaged with our customers across the different verticals within the verticals. And so that -- the event that we had last month is far from the only one where we pull together with our customers. But if that's the one that you're speaking about, it was a very positive event. And I think the themes that certainly struck me from that session were, number one, that I think a lot of the companies are really leaning in to the notion that they can improve their businesses by making yet more intense use of Data Analytics. And I think that the openness to looking to a third-party like ourselves is at least as high as it's ever been. There's specific and into substantial interest in a few things. One would be the insights derived from weather and climate science. I mean, it's just, if you listen to the earnings calls of most publicly traded insurance companies, their CEOs within the first 2 or 3 paragraphs are relating the weather to last quarter's results, either positively or negatively. And we actually impaneled some senior executives to -- in a plenary session, and that was -- and when asked the question of them, what do you see as the likeliest surprises in 2013, the answers all reduced to a surprise, climactically, either up or down. Happily, between our catastrophe modeling and our climate science, we are in a great position to provide leadership on that. I would also say that the predictive modeling theme is very strong, very active. And then new data sets, which are derived either from telemetry sources or new ways of trying to observe physical assets from a distance, these are 2 themes that are really good. So we feel as if the environment is one in which, if we do our work well and we create good solutions, that the market is very open to what it is that we can do to support them.", "Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And, Mark, on the Risk Assessment margins strengths, it was up year-over-year, I think 100 basis points. Was that basically due to the lower pension which was reduced by thinking Q2 last year?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "The pension change took place last year on March 1. There was very little benefit in first quarter relative to the first quarter of '12 resulting from the pension. This is just more rampant scale inside the business.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Bill Clark with KBW.", "William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Given the new solutions development investing you've been doing in Decision Analytics, which you kind of previously indicated would be concentrated mostly in the first half of the year, can you just give us a sense of if the 37.3% EBITDA margin in that segment is what we should expect to repeat again in 2Q? Or did more of the investment kind of fall on the first quarter and they will start to see that trend back up a little bit?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So let me start with that. A couple of things to note. One, I think the factors that contribute to it, yes, investment, clearly, was a part of the 1Q, the margin in DA. The other thing that's important to note is that we talk about the product mix shift. So as you think about products mix, you have health care growing quickly. The margins there, because it's a less mature business, don't have quite the same current margins as some of those insurance products. So that draws down or kind of hurts the margins, too, a little bit. I also want to remind you about the seasonality, to the conversation we had earlier, there's a level of fixed cost inside of all of our health care business. And to the extent that you think about revenue kind of being 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half of the year, that helps for and bolsters some of the margins for health care as you think about 2 -- this 2 half as opposed to the first half. I think all of those are kind of a part of the mix for DA.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Scott Stephenson for any closing remarks.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you very much. We appreciate your questions today, your interest in our company, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer, Corporate Finance and Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Houston, please go ahead.", "Eva F. Huston", "Thank you, April, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2013 financial results.", "With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.

Stephenson", "Thank you, Eva, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot of exciting initiatives underway, and we are energetically pursuing our data analytic agenda.", "Before I get to the future, I'd like to talk a little bit about our results in the quarter, with which I'm pleased. In second quarter 2013, we delivered strong overall performance with total revenue growth of approximately 13% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of 17%.", "Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the second quarter was approximately 8%. Organic revenue growth was 9.5% in the quarter, excluding our mortgage analytics business with its macro challenges.", "Profitability was strong, with an EBITDA margin of over 44% in the quarter even while we continue to invest in innovations as discussed previously.", "Year-to-date free cash flow growth, adjusted for last year's voluntary pension payment and the timing of a tax benefit in the first quarter of this year, was about 8% as we continue to generate strong operating cash flow, while we also elected to invest some of it into capital expenditures related to our investment initiatives.", "We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders, and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. We also remain active in looking at M&A. There have been a few sizable assets on the market recently, which you no doubt are aware of, but none of these met our criteria. So we declined to pursue them. We continue to focus on assets with a strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects.", "In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases of $116 million. We also refreshed our buyback authorization in the quarter by $300 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy, as we've previously outlined.", "As we look to the future, we need to continue to be thought leaders in analytics. As we've discussed, we are making significant investments in certain areas this year, including Touchstone, which is our catastrophe modeling platform; the unified platform in healthcare; aerial imagery; and supply chain analytics. All of these are going well and are in various stages of development and rollout.", "The first 2, Touchstone and the unified platform, are active with our clients. We're getting a great response on Touchstone, and we're seeing incremental value in our contracts with customers who have moved to the new platform. The unified platform in healthcare is also leading us to better results for customers and payment accuracy, where we have completed that phase of implementation.", "Aerial imagery is a wonderful initiative. It involves gathering images, but much more importantly, using those images to generate data that can be analyzed via computer vision. Initial customer feedback from pilots and evaluations have been very positive. And we're very excited about the imagery initiative, and we may choose to pull some of the intended 2014 investment forward into the second half of 2013 and the 2015 investments into next year.", "In addition, the supply chain platform is progressing well with very good conversations with customers on the functionality, as they're looking for it. We also are putting a lot of energy in deleveraging the value of our data and analytics across our enterprise. Everyday, we're discovering new ways in which different parts of our organization can collaborate for the benefit of our customers.", "We're able to do this effectively with our current leadership, and I've recently asked some of our leaders to bridge to added responsibilities that logically relate to their current responsibilities. For example, we're looking to do more work related to climate science across our AIR and AER businesses. We're also increasing our efforts to drive growth in Risk Assessment across the various categories, and we're adding to our leadership teams in the supply chain and corporate marketing areas.", "In this way, we have the best chance of remaining in touch with our markets and our customers, while expanding our collective ability to see and pursue our joint opportunities. Leadership is a key principle of the Verisk way, which you've heard me talk about before; and this is a natural way to ensure the development of our people.", "So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Thank you, Scott. We're pleased with our performance in the second quarter, in which we delivered both revenue growth and increased profitability while also investing for the future.", "In the second quarter, total revenue grew 12.9%, and organic revenue grew 7.8%. The results reflect the continued excellent revenue performance in healthcare, accelerating revenue growth in Insurance Solutions and another strong quarter contribution of -- from Argus. Mortgage revenue growth remained a headwind to overall growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, revenue growth organically grew at 9.5%.", "For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 16.6% revenue growth, of which 8.3% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of Argus and Aspect. Beginning in the quarter, MediConnect is a part of the organic revenue growth in the healthcare category.", "Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 9.5% in the second quarter and 8.9% organically, excluding the acquisition of Aspect. We had discussed our expectation of accelerating growth in the combined insurance this year and are pleased to see results headed in that direction with 7.9% organic revenue growth, including Risk Assessment.", "Our underwriting solutions delivered strong growth, and we saw a continued double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter. Our claims solutions also contributed to the growth.", "In financial services, which includes both Argus and the mortgage analytics business, revenue grew 43.1% in the quarter. Argus is an excellent business, performing very well since the acquisition in the third quarter of 2012. You will recall that Argus is a very ISO-like business, serving as a trusted, neutral intermediary using a contributory data model to help create analytics, which are deeply embedded in our customers' processes.", "The growth outlook in Argus remains positive, including through international expansion and partnering opportunities, as well as additional penetration of existing customers. We have seen growth of over 20% year-to-date at Argus on a pro forma basis and feel good about delivering or exceeding our estimate of mid-teens growth in 2013.", "The mortgage portion of financial services revenue declined 8.9% in the second quarter. Our origination revenue continues to grow, while our overall mortgage revenue declined due to the ongoing normalization of the forensic piece of the business.", "We're glad to see the decline in forensics slow this quarter. In addition, while early stage, we are seeing strong growth in some product sets that are an extension of the type of work we do in the forensic side, but aimed at the underwriting market. As we've said previously, we continue to believe the full year 2013 results may be similar to the revenue decline of about 11% we saw in 2012.", "Healthcare continued to deliver excellent revenue growth of 21.3% for the second quarter, all organic. We were especially pleased with the growth in our RQI division, which reflects the combination of our Revenue Integrity and HEDIS Reporting businesses, as well as MediConnect, which is now organic. We continue to find traction with our solutions in the market. Our sales efforts in the quarter were strong and as we continue to add new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers.", "In the quarter, of the new contracts we signed, 1/2 were with new customers. We are winning sizable contracts even larger than we have won historically, with important new and existing customers, which we expect will benefit us in 2014 and forward.", "We continue to be excited about the opportunity in the healthcare space, and we expect growth to remain well above the corporate average rate. As we've noted previously, the growth percentages naturally will be impacted, as we grow off of a larger base.", "We're coming off of some tough comparisons from the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2012. There has also been some opportunity for us to trade off between near-term pricing for higher, long-term committed volumes. These are all very good customers, where we see these arrangements as win-win for our long-term relationships.", "To provide you with some additional visibility as you think about your models, we expect full year organic growth in healthcare to be about 20%. And given the current pipeline, we expect growth in 2014 to continue in the same range, even when our businesses has more than doubled in size since 2011.", "Our specialized markets revenue grew 2.4% in the second quarter. Growth in weather and climate analytics was affected by lower growth in government contracts. We are pleased to see continuing traction in our efforts to repurpose our intellectual property to meet strong demand from our P&C industry customers.", "Growth in the environmental health and safety solutions was driven by ongoing customer agreements, moderated by lower volumes and some customer implementation projects.", "We think about AER and 3E as long-term options on the growing use of analytics around climate and supply chain and see them as longer-term elements of our growth strategy.", "Turning to Risk Assessment. For the second quarter, we reported revenue growth of 7%, indicating the value of -- to our long-standing insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting our 2013 invoices, which were effective January 1. The acceleration from this year's first quarter reflected the one-time revenue in the first quarter of 2012, which we've talked about before.", "Our property-specific information revenue grew 13.9% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales and higher volumes from certain customers, as they commit to extended long-term contracts, as well as incremental revenue contributions due to the expiration of a revenue sharing agreement with a technology provider in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "EBITDA for the second quarter was $185.6 million, as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 13.3% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 44.1%, even as we invested in our business. Acquisitions did not have any material effect on the consolidated EBITDA margin in the quarter.", "As we discussed with you last quarter, we have an ESOP in place, which was approaching its final distribution date in December of 2013. In May, we extended the allocation of the remaining unreleased shares through 2016. As a result, we will not incur a non-cash charge, as there is no termination distribution in 2013 in excess of our usual 401(k) match.", "The DA, or Decision Analytics, margins were 37.2% in the second quarter of 2013 versus 38.3% in the second quarter of 2012. The margin in the quarter reflects investments we have previously outlined. We remain very comfortable with the margin and the modest near-term impact, as we see opportunity to drive faster and sustainable top line growth into the future.", "In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 56% versus 52.8% in the second quarter of 2012. Our margins were helped in the quarter, partly as a result of higher levels of compensation in 2012 related to stock compensation vested for employees over the age of 62.", "We told you at the beginning of the year that we expected our 2013 EBITDA margins to be flat to modestly down compared to 2012, and that is still our expectation. We will continue to invest in our business to be prepared to support our important contract wins from the first half of the year, even in advance of the 2014 revenue.", "Additionally, we have been discussing some of the investment opportunities, including data acquisition for aerial imagery, which flows through our P&L. We expect these investments to help contribute to future top line growth and cash flow, as customer demand is supportive of our initiatives.", "Based upon the positive customer response, we are considering pulling forward some investments from 2014 into this year and investments from 2015 into the next. The net effect of all of this is that we feel very confident that we'll be able to hit the high end of our 43% to 45% EBITDA margin range in 2013, and we will continue to drive EBITDA and free cash flow growth.", "We can expect that in 2014 and forward as we continue to invest in new initiatives and accelerate them as appropriate, which will keep our margins in this current range.", "Our interest expense was $2.3 million in the second quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This increase was due to higher debt balances taken on during 2012 related to our acquisitions. We ended second quarter with total debt of about $1.4 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. The debt balance reflects the repayment of -- in the quarter of about $45 million of outstanding long-term private placement debt that matured in April of 2013.", "Our reported effective tax rate was 36.2% in the quarter. As we've discussed with you previously, we've been actively working on our tax planning strategies, and we're rewarded by the benefits resulting from this effort, again, in the quarter, as well as some small-time, one-time benefits. We now expect the full year tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for the full year 2013. We expect the normalized rate to be about 38% in 2014 and forward.", "Coming down to the net income line. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense, less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 17.6% to $94.9 million for the quarter.", "Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 17%.", "The average diluted share count was 172.5 million shares in the quarter. On June 30, 2013, our diluted share count was 171.7 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares for $116.1 million. At quarter end, we had about $306.6 million left under our authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized rates of return of over 25%. For 2013, we will continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution.", "Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, our cash and cash equivalents were about $172.6 million. Total debt, both long term and short term, totaled $1.4 billion. As I mentioned before, the debt balance reflects repayment in the quarter of about $45 million of our outstanding long-term private placement debt that matured in April 2013.", "We have another $100 million in private placement debt maturing in August, which we expect to repay from cash on hand or other debt. Today, our incremental debt capacity is over $900 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow.", "Our debt to pro forma EBITDA for June 30 was 1.9x, a little below our steady-state target. As you know, we're willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because we feel our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly.", "In the first half of 2013, free cash flow, we which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $182.6 million, an increase of about $33.2 million or 22.2% versus the first half of 2012. Free cash flow year-to-date, adjusted for the timing of excess tax benefits and the prior-year voluntary contribution of -- to our pension was $218.7 million, reflecting growth of 7.8% compared to the first half of 2012.", "Our capital expenditures were 7.8% of revenue in the first half of 2013, consistent with the incremental investments we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow represented 50% of EBITDA in the first half of 2013. Adjusted for the timing of items we mentioned previously, free cash flow represented 59.9% of EBITDA.", "As we think about capital spending for 2013, we are still expecting $115 million for the full year, including the $20 million of investment initiative spending. As you think about your models for the full year 2013, we anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $64 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $74 million and now a tax rate between 37% and 38%. We aim to keep share counts flat through our repurchase program. And at our current debt balances, our current quarterly interest expense is $19 million.", "Overall, our business is performing very well. We have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals, and we continue to invest for the future.", "With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "My first question was just on the comments you made on the aerial imagery investments, pulling that forward. Is there going to be any -- I guess, maybe just a little more color on what those planned investments were that you're pulling forward? And would there be any associated revenue through those initiatives that will come along with that, or is it just 1 investment for the future?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. This is Scott, Manav. Thanks for the question. So the investments we're making in aerial imagery, they really fall into 2 different categories. One is we're actually acquiring a lot of aerial images. And so, we have to pay for that, and we pay for that in 2 different ways. We work with third parties who have already sourced images. But much more importantly, we're sourcing our own images, which are much more granular and precise than what generally tends to be available. Our sweet spot is in image, where a pixel is about 1 inch to 1.5 inches. Whereas, most of what you see, for example, if you look at Google Earth, when you're looking at a building on Google Earth, a pixel is about 6 inches and not adequate for the kind of automated analysis of the image that we want to engage in. I mentioned computer vision before. That's the field of science and technology that is related to automatically extracting data from a photographic image. So, a, we have to acquire the images; and, b, we're building the capability to both house the images and the technology associated with their automated rendering. So that's the investment program. The part of it which becomes more significant, where the P&L is concerned that becomes more period expensed, is the acquisition of the images. And, yes, we definitely expect that there will be a revenue response to the images that we're acquiring. What we are working on right now is at what rate do we need to acquire the images in order to respond to what we see as the growing demand for the category. This all relates very strongly to what we do with Xactware in the repair cost estimating category. So to date, we actually do relate aerial images to all of the repair cost estimating we do in Xactware. But it's not at the level of analysis or granular detail that we're moving. And so, it's an extension of our -- it's an extension of the business that we're already in. We do generate a little bit of revenue from aerial imagery today, but we see it as a very, very substantial opportunity. So, yes, we do definitely expect that revenue will follow. But since it's a relatively new category for us, that's where the investment, particularly the acquisition of the images, may need to lead the revenue to some degree.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And you guys, I guess, maintained the full year CapEx. So does that mean that this will substitute some other investments, or is that subject to change once you guys do decide that you're going to pull forward these investments?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yes. Let me just take this. This is Mark. There are parts of this initiative and many others, where there's actual programming time that could be capitalized and put on our balance sheet. However, when you purchase data, it is required to be expensed. So when we talked about the CapEx numbers being relatively unchanged, I think that's consistent with what we said in the past. This, that we're calling out, actually has direct effect on the P&L because we are expensing the aggregation of images.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "And do let me just clarify on one thing. Mark talked about purchasing data. In the case of aerial imagery, most of what we're doing -- we're not buying it from someone else. We're actually generating the data ourselves. But it is, as Mark said, a period expense.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got it. And then, one more for me. Could you -- Mark, could you remind us of -- in the past, you've talked about the seasonality on the healthcare side with, I guess, the more weighting in the second half. Any changes to that mix or, sequentially, anything that you can help us model it?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yes. Historically, it has always been a -- healthcare, as a whole, has been a 40-60 type of seasonal split. So 40% on the first half, 60% on the second. We continue to try to bring that, kind of, more in line over the course of the year. But that is just the nature of the business right now.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "When talking about the 20% growth in healthcare -- and thank you for clarifying your goals in that segment. Is that an organic growth initiative? Meaning, is that the organic goal? And then, additionally, since you said 20% this year, 20% next year, I just wanted to ask, is it kind of a lumpy business with new customer implementations? And so, we probably could expect some volatility quarter-to-quarter, right?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "So, Andrew, it's Scott. So first of all, yes, we are talking organic growth rates when we're talking about the view for 2013 and the view for 2014. I'm not sure I would say lumpy exactly, but one thing that is going on in the business is, because of our growing presence in the healthcare field, one of the things that we're finding is that the size of the contracts that we're able to sign, in some cases, are becoming substantially larger than the average contract size that has to date applied in the business. And I'm talking about sales that we have secured and sales that we're very close to securing, neither of which have actually worked their way into the P&L yet. So I'm not sure I would use the phrase lumpy when talking about it in that way, but I do think that we're finding that the scale of the opportunities that were in front of us is getting bigger.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And also, when you speak about new customers, are we mostly talking about Medicare Advantage Plans being added or new customers a lot broader now?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "More broader than that. It's still the case that the lion's share of our business is with the health plans. But we've actually seen some very encouraging things happen with respect to the EA suite moving into the provider world.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "First, I just wanted to ask on the most recent comments about seeing the bigger contracts. Is that a reflection of seeing broader solutions being adopted, kind of, all at once by the clients? Or is it that they're taking on a bigger chunk of the claims activity or some other factor? I guess, what's driving the bigger contracts?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "It is both. Although, I would say that the primary effect in the contracts that I had in mind with the prior comment is a deeper penetration inside of, in 1 case, an existing customer and, in another case, an entity that was not a customer previously.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay...", "Scott G. Stephenson", "[indiscernible] with an existing solution side.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And as we think about organic growth for healthcare, what impact does MediConnect being rolled into that overall organic growth rate have? I don't think it was growing quite as fast as the rest of the healthcare channel...", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Actually, MediConnect's organic growth rate is very healthy. And the fact that it has moved into the organic category is not having any downward effect on the overall organic growth rate of the group.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then, just 1 follow-up on mortgage is -- the lessening -- or the smaller pace of decline -- I guess, you talked about some newer solutions you see growing there. But did you see -- I guess, is the smaller pace of decline related to those newer solutions, or is it that the fraud piece is declining by a smaller amount? Or did the kind of origination side tick up? I guess, I'm just trying to...", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, it's really both effects. So it's how big was the forensic piece. And now, as we move towards absolutely smaller numbers and the smaller fraction of what we do, any further shrinkage in the amount of business that we're doing there just proportionately is less impactful on the Interthinx case. And then, on the other side of it, yes, these new solutions are finding their place in the market and definitely having an effect on the overall outcome.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And, Mark, the 11% decline, does -- was that for the year, and does that factor in that Argus gets dropped into organic in Q4?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So let me just describe the 11%. I was talking specifically about the mortgage analytics business. And what we did last year, that would be 2012 full year, the mortgage analytics business was down about 11%. What we've been saying is that the full year 2013, we think, it will also be down about 13%. So obviously, we'd be down more than that in the first quarter. And hopefully, we'll start to see some stabilization and some growth, as we progress towards the end of this year for mortgage only. That does not have any...", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. So not that overall practice, if you will? Just that piece of it? Okay.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Correct. Negative 11% for both years for mortgage.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "And bear in mind, again, as Mark reported, financial services overall grew more than 40% in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from David Togut with Evercore Partners.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "It's Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Could you talk about the specific factors that drove the deceleration of your healthcare segment from 39% revenue growth in the first quarter to 21% in the second quarter? And maybe if you can just give us an update on business trends and the growth rate of each of your 3 major businesses within healthcare?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "So let me start off there, and Mark may want to add something there. Let me go back to second quarter of 2012 in order to kind of give you some perspective on the growth rates that healthcare -- the organic growth rates that healthcare has been turning in overall. So you'll remember that, in April of 2012, we acquired MediConnect. There's a suite of services that we provide, which are inside of the RQI division of healthcare. And essentially, what we're trying to do is to help health plans understand the quality with which they do what they do and to relate that to the cost that it requires them to do what they do. And we do that so that companies can be viable inside of the private insurance world, so that they can be viable with respect to Medicare Advantage. But that's the essence of what we're doing over there. There was pent-up demand for those services, and one of the things that we need to do to deliver the service is to access medical records. And so, we had a method. We have methods actually for doing that prior to the acquisition of MediConnect. But there was pent-up demand for those set of services. When we acquired MediConnect, what we -- and we talked about this at length, what we created was the ability to actually process faster because of the integration of the 2 businesses. And so, we began to respond to that pent-up demand as we moved into the third and the fourth quarter and even into the first quarter of 2013. And so, if you look at our growth rates inside of health, part of what was going on was that response to the pent-up demand. So I think what you're seeing when you compare, for example, first quarter to second quarter is that, that line of business is still healthy. It's still very growing nicely. But there was a particular reaction, which we expected based upon our increased capacity by virtue of bringing in MediConnect, and that was working very powerfully last half of last year and even into the first quarter of this year. And again, it's not that the effect has gone away, it's just that there was so much demand behind the dam. We don't really talk about specifically about the 3 divisions, but I'll just say that they're all important to the performance of Verisk Health. We're looking to all of them to grow. Just 2 weeks ago, we diligence-d the pipelines for each of the 3 divisions. They're all looking very healthy. And so, we have high expectations for all of them going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.", "Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "About Risk Assessment growth, how sustainable is the growth in the property-specific and underwriting piece of the business? I mean, do you anticipate staying at the high end of that 5% to 7% range that you have talked about in the past?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So, Suzi, let me just highlight here. I think, common things that we've seen that have been reassuring inside of the property-specific is that we've been able to transition many customers from what are transactional type of purchases to longer-term contracts with higher committed volumes. So that has been a positive. I think we've found some stabilization even inside some of the transaction volumes that were causing some ebbs and flows over the last several years. So that's sustainable. That's positive. At the same time, I think one of the things that we've called out is that we did have a contract. It was a 20-year-old contract with a technology provider that came to an end in 2012. So as a result of that kind of rearrangement -- or change in arrangement, we had benefited from a new arrangement where there's more revenue for us, and we've taken over the partners of technology because we felt it's kind of core to the service. That, in 2013, will be here, will continue into the future, but we do get some benefit from the growth over what was a different arrangement in '12. So I think a good portion of the growth continues, a portion of the growth is onetime and will continue into the future. I don't want to say onetime, but it's more of a one-time growth. Okay?", "Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then, on specialized markets, I guess, that's been running in the low-single digits. Is there any reason to think that, that should start to pick up?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I think that, in the near term, we are still working to essentially transform the categories that those phase [ph] meaning, the supply chain domain and the commercialization of climate science. And so, in the near term, no. In the long term, we think of them as options against really kind of building new categories that don't exist today. And we'll certainly work hard to keep you informed as we feel like we've reached those moments where we've actually -- we've created something substantially new and different. And we're working very hard at that.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Let me just -- to emphasize, I mean, I appreciate the question about Risk Assessment. I'd just like to continue to kind of reinforce the fact that I think we kind of think of some of the way we go to market for both the Decision Analytics and Risk Assessment customers. They're the same customers. We're trying to sell a suite. And I think we continue to be effective there with some accelerating organic growth, kind of, across the 2 categories.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Good to see the uptick in your insurance business within Decision Analytics. Could you talk a little bit about some of these newer solutions, whether it's Touchstone or the -- it sounds like you're in the market with that in aerial imaging, which maybe is more of a '14 event. But did we get back to double-digit organic revenue growth within that business this year? Or is that still the longer-term expectation? Or are we, kind of, at what you think is a steady-state for the insurance part of the business today?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, I guess, I would put it this way. I -- we are excited about a number of opportunities to bring more value to our insurance customers. We are at a moment in the P&C industry where there is as much -- or more openness to technology-driven innovation in insurance as, I think, there's ever been. And I think that there's a very settled understanding now that data analytics is going to play a very important role in all of that. So we're -- we really appreciate the relationship we have with our P&C customers, and we -- it's, in many ways, a good moment to be a partner to them, given sort of how their world and, therefore, our world with them is moving. Some of the things that we're talking about, for example, aerial imagery -- just to again go back to that one for a moment, when it fully emerges, it's potentially a very large category. And so, it remains to be seen whether or not we're able to put the solutions together in such a way that they become so compelling that the full market opportunity is realized. But there's a great sense of promise there. Over on the catastrophe modeling side, to just pick another one, the businesses is becoming much more richly featured than it used to be. Basically, our customers used to be primarily interested in the stochastic models. Now equally, they are interested in the decision-support software and the ability to try to pull a lot of observations together derived from the cat modeling world and apply them even at the level of the individual risk. And so, that kind of movement, we think, naturally creates the opportunity to bring substantially more value to the customers than has been there in the past. We haven't really sort of -- a rifle shot, a number in terms of what the organic growth rate is that all of that implies. But the kinds of things that I was just talking about become material relative to the book of business that we already have. And so, we're optimistic. We're leaning into the opportunities in the P&C space.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And as far as the investment pull-forward, I know you've made some comments about EBITDA margin this year. Mark, would the magnitude of the investment pull-forwards have the same sort of impact on your out-year EBITDA margin, whereby we might see revenue growth acceleration but perhaps flat-to-down margin over next year? Is that -- are you pulling forward that much spend, for example?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So I think what we would probably need to do is really think about this in terms of we're building a product today, and we wanted to make sure we have a robust product come into market because we have had customers that are excited about it. As we think about, kind of, the pull-forward that we've just talked about, a little of that has to do with, now, customer reaction and customer response. So I think the answer to your question is we have some pretty big kind of CapEx or an expense that we're kind of bringing through in the first half. We would probably continue, as we described and what we kind of hinted towards in the second half. As I get into 2014, it's a little bit tough to marry up kind of the revenue and the expense around those categories. I would see that the investment would be large. I'm not sure if it's going to be materially larger than what you'll see in '13. So from a relative margin perspective, I don't have great visibility quite yet. But I don't -- I wouldn't put margin erosion on it. I would just say we should probably maintain [indiscernible] flatter.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful color. And one more, if I may. When you look at your healthcare -- unified healthcare platform, do you think that's an offering that can start to really move the needle for you next year? Or is this -- are we talking about a multi-year effort as far as revenue incremental revenue from that?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I think you should think of it as multiyear, but I do believe the effects will -- I mean, actually, we've already seen the effects. Just to kind of recap for you, we have already implemented the unified platform for large customers in the payment accuracy division. Next up is the Enterprise Analytics, and that's a '14 deliverable. And then, we move into RQID in '15. So there are already effects, and we will see more effects in '14 than we have in '13. But it is -- it's a multi-year march. So it's kind of both, really. We will begin to see more and more benefit. I think that it's really when the entire suite has been enabled that the promise of being able to go to the customer and say, \"Would you like us to turn this on for you?\" is really -- I think that's when we're really there. And the third of the 3 divisions is a 2015 deliverable on that plan.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Earlier, you said about some of the contracts in healthcare hadn't -- aren't fully up to speed yet. You've just signed them, and you've [indiscernible] larger. So as you look at your comment -- we go back to your comments about the 20% growth this year and next. Could you just maybe give us some of the assumptions behind that? How much is some of those new contracts you won just coming up to speed? How much are sort of other contracts you've won kind of scaling up or what's new contracts or new clients?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure. I think one of the things that we tried to highlight is that it has been a very good new sales year for the first half of '13. But the way customers adopt and implement, it's not always they can go right away. So we may pick up a little bit in '13, but a lot of these things are actually priming for and looking towards 2014. And in large part, because of the nature of this 40-60 revenue split, a lot of it does actually hang on the latter part of the second half of '14. The other thing that we've tried to, at least, mention a little bit, we've had -- some of these contracts for customers have come to us, and they've said, \"Let's have a conversation about us giving you bigger volumes and longer-term commitments. Is there a way to marry up kind of some price with these longer commitments?\" And we're willing to do that for the right customers and for the right type of volumes. And all of that kind of plays out in a way that probably helps us in '14, and it certainly kind of impacts kind of the way we think about into the future and beyond.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So I guess, if I heard you correctly, you're just communicating that your visibility is better based on some of these changes you're talking about?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Agreed. I mean, I just can't get into the details of contracts except that we're feeling very good about the pipeline, and it's more of a '14 type of new sales win where we see revenue.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.", "Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Step back and focus on the insurance portion of the business. Can you just clarify what impact any changes in insurance premium growth has on your business and when that would occur?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. Can I -- let me talk about it generally and then maybe Mark would like to talk about where we are in the premium environment right now. But the thing that we would like you to understand is that there is nothing even close to a 1:1 relationship between what's happening in the world of insurance premiums and our revenue picture. And that's true for a couple of reasons. First of all, something like 40% of our insurance revenue references, in some way, what's happening with respect to premiums. Meaning, inside of our pricing algorithm is some reference made to premium volumes, only about 40% of our revenue is priced in that way. And of that 40%, there are 3 terms in the pricing algorithm. So there's the premium, there's a mill rate that we attach to the premium and then there's a flat fee. And we are annually assessing the 2 terms in that equation that we are responsible for, which is the mill rate and the flat -- and the flat fee. And we're very thoughtful about what we're doing with both of those. And so, it's not the case that there's a linear relationship even in that 40% between where did the premium move year-over-year, where did our revenues move year-over-year. There were actually several years where there was negative premium growth. Recently, several years where there was negative premium growth in the industry, and yet our revenues actually grew. And then, on top of all of that, I would go back to the point that Mark made a couple of minutes ago, which is we think of everything that we do in insurance as a relatively integrated whole. And so, when we think about setting the terms in that pricing algorithm, we have it very much in mind that we want to preserve and extend the opportunity to sell the other parts of our suite, which are not priced that way. And so, what I really want to strongly move you away from is a sense that the premium environment is strongly -- or, I would say, even modestly affecting what our business is doing. Mark, do you want to comment on kind of where we are right at the moment?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "As an example, I know that there's been some better news with regard to premium growth inside of 2012 relative to, say, 2011. The way we operate in a loose affiliation, 12 premiums would relate to some of our invoicing in 2014. But I will kind of reemphasize Scott's point. What we're trying to do is make sure that there's value to customers, and the customers are looking at the bottom line, how much the invoice is. And we want to make sure that that's fair. We want to make sure that, that is well thought of, so that we can sell other services and other solutions typically from the DA suite to them. And that's the long-term relationship building and the best way for us to win in the long term.", "Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. I appreciate the clarity. And then, on a different tact. I know you don't do a lot of government business, but if you can just remind us roughly what your exposure is to government business? And did you see any impact from sequestration last quarter?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Sure. Government business is rather modest. It sits inside the specialized -- inside of '13, it probably hurt us to the tune of $2 million to $3 million in '13 -- or will hurt us.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "This is Jamie Friedman. 2 questions, 1 for Scott and then for Mark. First, Scott, I was just wondering, financial service, obviously, had a good print. I was wondering if you had any comments on the up-selling characteristics going on within financial service now? And then, moving over to Mark. Mark, if you could comment about the Risk Assessment margin, and your updated guidance was helpful. But specific to Risk Assessment, how we should think about the contribution margin, if you will, longer term? So first on financial service, then on Risk Assessment margin.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. The deeper penetration of existing customer relationships is a very important theme inside of what's going on in financial services. If I look at the business we do with the retail banks around the credit card line and demand deposits, essentially, up-selling is a very major part of what's happening in that business. And it's really -- and it continues to move through 3 levels. So the first level is the thing that we just love to do at Verisk, and that is build the contributory data set and create an industry-level set of Analytics around that contributory data set. And that's how the whole business got started. The next level then is to take the analytics derived from that and to find ways to apply them more precisely on a customer-by-customer basis. And so, that's the first level of up-sell that goes on. What we found is, even beyond that, we have created such a good analytic environment for retail banking analysis that, at the third level, we actually have a growing number of customers that, actually, in addition to purchasing level 1 and level 2, they also actually want to purchase the analytic environment. They want to license the analytic environment from us, which is, in no sense, cannibalizing what we were doing at the other levels. And so, that really is the story of what's going on with respect to those product sets inside of retail banking, and it continues to be a very important part of the growth that is occurring there. In fact, not -- there's -- we are acquiring new customers partly because that part of our business is actually finding its mark in overseas markets. But if you look at, for example, the United States market, a fair fraction of our growth is moving up that cross-sell ladder from the first stage to the second stage to the third stage, and that continues.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Let me jump over to the Risk Assessment. I think what we continue to find promising is Risk Assessment does turn out very nice and stable growth to the extent that, that growth is kind of the above the cost of generally people. We've been able to have some high incremental margins on that business. The operating leverage is strong, and I think we feel very good about that. The one thing I wanted to just highlight, though, is that when we talk about investment, it is across the entire enterprise. And we have high expectations for Risk Assessment around trying to find new opportunities in markets too. And inside that, they have investment initiatives that should certainly be a part of all of this and be considered in. So what you saw in the second quarter was some strength. Remember, a bit of it was the result of the way we recognize expense around options. So if you compared second quarter of '13 to '12, that is -- that piece is a one-time effect. And I just want to caution you to just remember that as you do comparisons from '13 to '12. There is a bit of one-time amount in there.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Hopefully, Jamie, that was responsive to your 2 questions.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over -- back over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you very much. And I just like to thank everybody for joining us for our second quarter earnings call here today. We appreciate your interest and your support, and we look forward to speaking to you again at the conclusion of the next quarter. Thanks very much, and enjoy your day.", "Operator", "Thank you for joining today's conference call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.", "Eva F. Huston", "Thank you, Julie, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.

Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you, Eva, and good morning all. Before I launch into the financial results for this quarter, which were solid but shy of our longer-term objectives, I'd like to review several recent accomplishments. We are confident our long-term prospects remain excellent.", "Over the years, you've heard us speak about running the business with a long-term prospective. Our view on this remains consistent. Recently, we put more emphasis on our innovation agenda, which has always been an underlying theme for how we have grown while delighting our customers. Our long-term management of the business and our determination to innovate are very well aligned. Innovation works over long cycles, and we will continue to invest in a thoughtful way to support new data analytics solutions for our customers, which will result in strong revenue growth over time.", "We remain focused on our twin goals of organic growth through innovation and operating our business with efficiency and scalability. We were pleased to achieve several innovation milestones in the third quarter, including initial customer use of our pooled data initiative for healthcare, our first provision of Roof Insight reports using aerial imagery and the first sale of our new supply chain platform. While these initiatives are not revenue-generating in the quarter or materially in 2013, they are a good indication of future opportunity.", "To delve a bit deeper into what these can mean, let me take as an example the new pooled data initiative to fight healthcare fraud, which Verisk Health launched in the third quarter. With some of the nation's leading healthcare payors joining as founding members, we built a database across payor information and analytics designed to combat the estimated $300 billion that America's healthcare loses annually to fraud, waste and abuse. This initiative will turn the identification of improper or elicit billing practices from an abstract view into an actionable one and save millions in claims dollars in the process. For the first time, healthcare payors will be afforded the same comprehensive view of suspect providers and schemes that has proved so successful for the property casualty industry through our claim search platform.", "As another example, as the fourth quarter began, we announced the creation of the Verisk Climate division. Our customers in insurance and government and across the supply chain are increasingly voicing concern about the effects that climate volatility and environmental extremes are having on their operations and on their earnings. We formed the Verisk Climate division to introduce new weather and environmental analytics that will enable our clients to assess and plan for environmental impacts and to implement strategies to differentiate and grow their businesses despite those impacts. We and our customers will benefit as we create integrated solutions that directly leverage the data and platforms of our other Verisk operating units. While we manage the business with a long-term of view, we are mindful of the need to execute day to day, and we understand our progress toward our strategic objectives.", "In the third quarter, our organic growth was a bit soft for 3 reasons: first, property claims activity was low relative to historic norms leading to moderated transaction volumes on our claims estimating platform for the property and casualty industry; second, our mortgage business continues to adjust downward toward historic norms with respect to the analysis of defaulted loans; and third, we made the decision to accept downward price adjustments in the Revenue and Quality Intelligence division of Verisk Health in order to achieve higher committed volumes with key customers on a multi-year basis.", "Last quarter, we shared with you our forecast for our organic growth at Verisk Health, and we now expect organic growth for 2013 to be in the 12% to 14% range. The differences between our original assumptions and today were changes at 4 customer accounts. In 3 cases, work has been slow to start or ramp, and in one case, we made price concessions in exchange for multi-year volume commitments. Having redoubled our efforts to forecast this highly transactional business, we are comfortable that we can grow revenue in this business in the mid-teens in 2014. While our near-term outlook has changed, there has been no change in the market size or our opportunity to compete in the vertical. Corporately, we will remain focused on the efficiency of our operations while also elevating investment as we re-platform several solutions and acquire new data sets.", "In the third quarter of 2013, we delivered a good overall performance with total revenue growth of 10% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 15%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the third quarter was about 6%, which is below our long-term historical trend line. Organic revenue growth was over 8% in the quarter, excluding our mortgage analytics business with its macro challenges. Profitability was strong with EBITDA margin over 46% in the quarter. We expect that level of margin to be a high watermark as we continue to manage toward our innovation agenda.", "We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders, and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. We also remain active in looking at M&A. We continue to focus on assets with a strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth opportunities. In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $24 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was $282 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy as we previously outlined it.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Thanks, Scott. For the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue growth and increased profitability. In the third quarter, total revenue grew 10%, and organic revenue grew 6.1%. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8.2%. Let me dive into the details for you.", "For the third quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 11.2% of revenue growth, of which 5.2% was organic, excluding the acquisition of Argus. Beginning next quarter, Argus will be part of the organic revenue growth in the financial services category. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category revenue grew 11.5% in the third quarter. We had discussed our expectation of accelerating revenue growth of the combined insurance revenue this year and are pleased to see ourselves continue in the direction with 9.5% organic revenue growth in the quarter, including Risk Assessment.", "Our underwriting solutions delivered strong growth, and we saw a continued double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter. Our claims solutions also contributed to growth but not as strongly as in the past due to historical claim trends Scott referenced. Additionally, we saw a benefit of a little over $3 million related to the implementation of our solutions with a large customer. The comparison in the fourth quarter for insurance are a bit tougher as we saw in the past 2 quarters.", "In financial services, which includes both Argus and the mortgage analytics business, revenue grew 26.6% in the quarter. Argus has continued to perform very well since the acquisition in third quarter 2012. Argus is a very ISO-like business and serves as a trusted, neutral intermediary using a contributory data model to help create analytics, which are deeply embedded in our customers' workflows. The growth outlook at Argus remains positive, including through international expansion and partnering opportunities, as well as additional penetration of existing customers. We have seen growth of over 20% year-to-date at Argus on a pro-forma basis and feel good about exceeding our estimate of mid-teens growth in 2013.", "The mortgage portion of the financial services revenue declined 16.6% in the third quarter. The origination-related revenue declined this quarter, about in line with the market and the ongoing normalization of the forensic piece of the business continued. We were glad to see a slower decline in forensic revenue again this quarter.", "Full year 2013 results may be a little lower than the revenue decline we saw in 2012, which was about 11%. The mortgage market remains bumpy, and originations are expected to continue to decline through 2013.", "Healthcare revenue grew 6.2% for the third quarter, which was below our expectations. We had a few customers where we now expect transactional volumes the come through later than we previously planned. In addition, we mentioned last quarter that there was an opportunity for us to trade near-term pricing for longer-term volume commitments. In some cases, we are seeing the volumes ramp up more slowly than our customers initially anticipated. These are very good customers where we continue see these agreements as win-win for our longer-term relationships. As a result, we now expect 2013 revenue growth to be between 12% and 14%. We expect growth in 2014 to be in the mid-teens. We remain excited about the opportunity in the healthcare space, and we expect growth to remain above the corporate average growth rate in 2014.", "Our specialized markets revenue declined 1.4% in the quarter. Growth in weather and climate analytics was affected by lower growth in government contracts. We are pleased to see continuing traction in our efforts to re-purpose our intellectual property to meet strong demand from our P&C industry customers. We think our formation of Verisk Climate will enhance our ability to capitalize on that. Growth in environmental health and safety solutions were driven by ongoing customer agreements moderated by lower volumes from customer implementation projects. We expect to see a several million dollar sequential decline in specialized revenue next quarter due to cycling of government contracts in climate analytics prior to the ramp-up of our commercial solutions, as well as fewer environmental health and safety projects as we approach year end.", "We think about AER and 3E as long-term options on a -- the growing use of analytics around climate and supply chain, and see them as elements for our growth agenda in the future. In our recent launch of Verisk Climate division and with our ongoing efforts in the supply chain area, we can start to see evidence of the kind of traction we hope to gain over time.", "Turning to Risk Assessment. For the third quarter, we reported revenue growth of 7.8%, indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 5.1% in the quarter, reflecting our 2013 invoices, which were effective January 1. Our property-specific information revenue increased 17.2% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales and higher volumes from certain customers as they commit to expanded long-term contracts, as well as incremental revenue contributions due to the exploration of a revenue sharing agreement with a technology provider in the fourth quarter 2012. Innovation is also an important component of our heritage business. We continue to work closely with our customers to innovate around international solutions and enhanced predictive analytics and commercial real estate solutions building on our P&C expertise.", "EBITDA for the third quarter was $202.9 million as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 10.9% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 46.3%. As Scott mentioned, we are eager to continue our investment program and are focused on doing that while maintaining a strong margin profile. We intend to accelerate our investment in aerial imagery in the fourth quarter, which will likely have a P&L impact of about $10 million.", "The margins in Decision Analytics were 41.4% in the third quarter 2013 versus 40.9% in the third quarter 2012. The margin in the quarter reflects good cost management even as revenue growth decelerated in the quarter. We continue to make the necessary investments in the business to support our innovation agenda.", "In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 55.1% versus 54.6% third quarter of '12. Our margins were helped in the quarter by good cost management in natural scaling business.", "We told you at the begin of the year that we expected our 2013 EBITDA margins to be flat to modestly down compared to 2012. Based on the investments discussed above and spending to support ongoing and future customer contracts, margins may be down up to 100 basis points. The net-net of all this is that we still feel confident that we'll be towards the upper end of the 43% to 45% EBITDA margin range in 2013, and we'll continue to drive EBITDA and free cash flow growth. You can expect in 2014 and forward that we'll continue to invest in new initiatives and accelerate them as appropriate, which will likely keep our margin in the current range.", "Our interest expense was up $0.6 million in the third quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This increase was due to higher debt balances taken on during 2012 related to our acquisitions. We ended the third quarter with total debt of about $1.3 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. The total debt balance reflects the repayment in the quarter of about $100 million of our long-term private placement debt in August of 2013. At quarter end, we also repaid an additional $35 million in long-term private placement debt.", "Our reported tax rate was 36.2% in the quarter. As discussed over the past several quarters, we've been working actively in our tax planning strategies. In the third quarter, we again saw a onetime benefit resulting from those efforts. We now expect the tax rate to be a little below 37% for the full year 2013. We expect the normalized rate to be about 38% for 2014 and forward.", "Coming down to the net income line. We focused on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 15% to $106 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.62 for the quarter, an increase of 14.8%.", "The average diluted share count was 172.2 million shares in the quarter and also at quarter end. In 3Q, we purchased about 381,000 shares for $24.4 million. We had about $282 million left under our authorization at September 30. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date generating annualized IRRs of over 25%. For 2013, we continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution.", "Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents were $180.2 million. Total debt, both long term and short term, was about $1.3 billion. As I mentioned before, the debt balance reflects repayments in the quarter. Today, our incremental debt capacity is over $1 billion and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Also, just as after the quarter, we upsized our credit facility to $975 million of commitments, all of which is undrawn and available for general corporate purposes, including M&A. Our debt to pro forma EBITDA at September 30 was 1.7x, below our steady-state target. As you know, we're willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly.", "Year-to-date in 2013, free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $271.6 million, an increase of about $7.4 million or 2.8% versus the first 9 months of 2012. Our capital expenditures were 9.1% of revenue year-to-date in 2013. Free cash flow generated represented about 47.8% of EBITDA in the first 9 months of 2013, and adjusted for the timing of certain tax benefits mentioned previously, free cash flow represented 54.1% of EBITDA.", "As we think about capital spending for 2013, we are now expecting $160 million for the full year, including about $30 million of investment initiative spending. We have increased our expectations for capital expenditures due to business opportunities, as well as some timing for multi-year hardware and software purchase support growth of our business.", "As you think about your models for the full year 2013, we still anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $64 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $72 million and now a tax rate below 37%. We aim to keep share counts flat through our repurchase program. And at current debt balances, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Overall, revenue growth remains solid, margins strong, and we are innovating for the long term.", "With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "First, I guess, I wanted to ask about the healthcare business. And just, I guess, I apologize if I missed it, but just to make sure I heard it correctly. The weakness was mainly in RQI, and it was isolated to 4 main customers. Is that correct?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Tim, this is Scott. Yes, that's correct. They're -- basically all of -- the difference between our original expectations and where the quarter came out were a function of events at 4 customers, and in all cases, that was related to RQI.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And did you trade off lower price for more volume at each of those customers? Or was...", "Scott G. Stephenson", "No, no. In the comments I made upfront, Tim, I said that of the 4, 3 of them were slowdowns in terms of implementation or ramping. One of them was because we traded off price for longer-term commitments.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And do you have any sense for why the volumes slowed down, I guess, at those customers?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "A lot of it has to do with the ability to get implemented. And the ability to get implemented is not always fully in our control.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "But these are new -- these are not existing customers that slowed down from what you saw last year necessarily. These are new customers that didn't add as much...", "Scott G. Stephenson", "One thing to bear in mind about our business, Tim, is that we have a very healthy mix of new business with new parts of an existing customer, as well as absolutely new customers. And so you actually have those effects inside of what was happening. In other words, an existing customer, which is trying to implement in a different part of their operation, that actually shows up in some of those cases that I was just mentioning.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I guess, if we want to look, is there any -- in trying to understand, was there any competitive impact? And/or was there any signs that the customers are less interested or demand is less for these solutions?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "No, to both questions.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then just the follow-up, did I -- on the margin side, did you say -- with the 100 basis points for the -- was that in terms of margins being down perhaps as much as that? Was that for the year or...", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Correct. Yes, it was for a year.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. So obviously, an even bigger decline implied for the fourth quarter.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to also ask about revenue quality intelligence, RQI. This unit primarily serves Medicare Advantage plans, optimizing reimbursements and such. And when you look at the headlines for Medicare Advantage plans at places like UnitedHealth, it seems like Medicare Advantage plans themselves have some headwinds. Do you think that has anything to do with what you described in the Verisk Health business?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes, Andrew, this is Scott. I don't actually. And you're right about those headlines, and we're aware of what's going on in the space. But the fundamental fact of our situation remains that we are still a relatively small player inside of this world. And so our opportunity is ahead of us, and it really is centered upon building out our business and acquiring business with a number of plans that we don't even work with today. And so yes, there are the dynamics of what's going on inside of the category. Although I will say that it remains the case that Medicare Advantage plans are still highly incented to get after precise measurement of their performance, both cost and quality, since their reimbursement hangs upon it so deeply, and that's the category that we're providing here. So no, I don't think that there's really any affect in what happened in this quarter nor will there be in the -- at least, in the near-term future because our opportunity is essentially to take more space starting from a relatively small position.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right. And you said these 3 clients will be implemented soon, right?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "They are -- we believe that all of them are in the process of moving towards contracting with us and/or expanding their business with us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So Scott, I had a couple of questions. Upfront you had described some of the innovation initiatives related -- one you mentioned related to pooled healthcare fraud from -- yes, so maybe if you could help us to -- it seemed important, potentially important that you have payers that are joining that initiative. If you could help us to understand how that rolls out and the magnitude of it.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Right. So first with respect to the rollout, a lot of -- a fundamental fact is that a lot of the fraud, waste and abuse the goes on in healthcare is actually perpetrated by providers. And when you take that perspective, then immediately, you're framing on trying to get after this becomes a somewhat local one because you're actually trying to diligence providers in the way they interact with payers more on a market-by-market basis. And so the way that we've gotten started with this is the -- in the first phase of this, we've got -- we have 2 national players who have come in, but they have come in only for certain localities. And so the rollout is going to take 2 forms: one is hope -- we expect that they will bring more and more of their localities into the pooled data initiative; and then secondly, more payers will enter in to the initiative. And so just to kind of give you a sense of kind of the scale of all of this, with the providers that we started with, we're dealing with a relatively small fraction of their total business is inside of what we're doing today. And the next wave of payers to come in, we would expect it to be on the order kind of 3 to 5 additional source of plans, and that sort of pace of build over the course of rest of '13 and into 2014, is kind of what we're looking for. So it does grow. It's not growing linearly. It will be much more than that, and there is the network effect of having more and more payers in the process. So we -- that's the way that we think it'll grow.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, that sounds exciting. And then switching gears on the aerial imaging side. Mark, you had mentioned $10 million of incremental investments. Is that -- if you -- so are you putting infrastructure into database, the images? Is it procurement of the infrastructure to get those images? Where is that $10 million going?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure. So let me describe, the images are one thing, obviously, a lot of people have pictures. What we are actually trying to do is go one step beyond that and from those pictures derive data through a computer vision actually creating what is specific measurements of roofs and homes and information that can be used for both claims and underwriting in the P&C space. We have been on this agenda now for over a year, and we have built out the infrastructure from standpoint of the technology, the data center and the servers. However, as you actually start to collect and aggregate data in the form of images, that needs to be expensed, not a CapEx item. And so we're trying to call out some of the P&L impact associated with that initiative, and there is a bigger chunk in the fourth quarter. That's what I was trying to describe there in the $10 million.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then the last question, if you look at both of these, should we view them between pooled health and aerial imagery as long-term revenue objectives? Or are we going to see some waterfall sooner potentially next year?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "We definitely expect revenue from both in 2014, absolutely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Capital Markets.", "Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "This is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on healthcare within Payment Accuracy and Enterprise Analytics, maybe how those businesses performed, excluding RQI?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Let me take that one. This is Mark. The general theme is they have performed well. I would tell you that the bigger growth in the opportunity at least recently has been with RQI, and that's where we've seen some big customer contracts. I think the underlying theme around Payment Accuracy, which is the fraud and abuse case, is very strong, and we continue to have nice ramping customers in volumes. Although as the business gets larger, it's tough to grow at the same percentage rate. So what we've seen is growth extension and the opportunity to continue to add dollars. But the dollars are on a bigger base, so the percentages are lower. From an EA, which we refer to as Enterprise Analytics side of things, a little more competition in this space. I think we see opportunities there that extend beyond what as providers -- excuse me, extend beyond what are the payers and into the provider space, and we're ramping up in spending and investing there with the opportunity to kind of extend the market opportunity as what is, call, population management or the world of what we do in Enterprise Analytics can be applied to a shifting set of risks potentially inside of the healthcare space as providers probably take on some more risk in the future.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "And I'll just add to that, a very pleasing fact for us is that we now have a material fraction of all the ACOs, which have been launched to date as customers for our EA division, which is a really, really nice place to sit.", "Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And just one follow-up, Mark, I apologize if I missed this. Did you say there was any change to your 2013 investment plans and innovation of -- or is it still tracking at around $90 million?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So I think what we tried to describe, the dealer part was -- and this is more of a CapEx discussion and then I'll double back into the P&L. Our CapEx is higher right now. I want to just at least give a little color and clarity on that. And inside that, I think at least $10 million additional has been added. So now we're at about $30 million inside that CapEx because of these investment initiatives and some of that additional CapEx is really just because operational needs to get the bigger, whether it's around facilities or just it's around computing power. That's been the focus with some additional CapEx. I think that answer your question. If you're more on the P&L side, I'm happy to go into a little deeper dive there, but what we tried to reflect inside of the -- up to 5 -- 100 bps is some of the expense that we would incur resulting from the investment initiatives, which are more than $90 million today from what I'll call P&L perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.", "Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I know you've been asked this question a number of different ways, and I'm not sure that I completely understand this. So how significant were the pricing concessions? Because maybe I'm not thinking about this right, but if part of the disappointment in Health in the quarter was related to delays in transactional volume. And I think you mentioned that was the case with 3 of the 4 big customers. Then, why aren't you expecting growth next year to be higher than mid-teens? I mean, is the real underlying organic growth in healthcare now actually lower just given that, that mid-teens number includes some of this catch-up revenue?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes, it's not -- no, there's not a catch-up effect here. So I'm not quite sure I'm tracking your question, but let me say it the way that we see it and understand it. So we made some trade-offs in the third quarter with respect to price, which showed up in our third quarter results, will show up on our fourth quarter results. And will have the effect of relating to transaction volumes in '14, '15 and '16 in particular. Then separately, there are customers that we're finding are intending to be our customers, but the rate at which they are moving into being a part of our customer set is lower than we had originally thought it would be. And that applies in the quarter, but also as we try to think about where the business is going to be in '14, we're seeing some of that same effect. And as I think you know, a large fraction of what we do and in healthcare, about 70% of it, is transactional as opposed to the rest of Verisk, which is about 70% subscription and recurrent. And so that which we don't get in '13, it's not -- it doesn't just roll over into '14.", "Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, and then separately, when do you expect mortgage to bottom? And then are you going to continue breaking out mortgage within the financial segment going forward once Argus is brought into organic?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, I'm sure that we would -- I'm not on the point about specifically what our reporting looks like, but certainly, we will continue to comment on mortgage just because mortgage is a meaningful part of what we're doing in financial services. With respect to the bottoming, you got to look at 2 things. One is what's happening with respect to mortgage origination volumes. And there, according to the MBA, the expectations for '14 is it'll be a somewhat softer market than '13. And then the other piece is cycling through the forensic piece, and our view is we haven't quite gotten to the bottom yet, but we're moving towards it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just another question on healthcare. Just it looks like your fourth quarter, your guidance for 2013 would imply fourth quarter healthcare revenue growth to be about 0% to 6%. Is that what -- is that the right implication? And then on 2014, we just saw the trading pricing for volume, we start to see that pick up in '14, so why -- just maybe one more point of clarification on why we're not kind of reaccelerating back toward that 20%? Then a quick final one on the margin. Are we flat into '14 from 100 basis points down in '13?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Okay, so let me take the healthcare question. So for first of all, in the fourth quarter, you talked about a 0% to 6% range. We think we're at the higher end of that range but yes. Again, the slowdown on the ramp-up is an effect which doesn't happen at just one moment in time. In other words, we're trying to be very clear and very thoughtful about what we see happening across the customer base, existing customers, as well as prospects, the ramping up at existing customers, as well as prospects. And so that effect is at work in '14, as well as '13. And then, Mark, do you want to just talk about the margin question for a moment?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yes, when I was referring to the 100 bps, I was referring to full year '13. I think we've continued to have a view that we'll be in that high end of the range of 43% to 45% as we roll into '14 and beyond.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just one on healthcare for me as well. But the impact, I guess, the pricing impact on that one customer, I'm just trying to understand like can we see more of that sort of trade off that you're making on additional customers down the road that could have a similar impact.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I would say that it's possible. What happened in this case was very specific to the individual customer. And -- but we're also paying a lot of attention to price realization in the category. And again, we are still sort of the, relatively speaking the new kid on the block in healthcare generally. We were -- in 2010, we did about $55 million of healthcare and you know where we are now. So our position is one that isn't -- is emerging relatively quickly. It's in a category where a lot of the product today tends to be transactional rather than long-term subscription. So we're working very hard to secure that business. But it's also the case that the customers themselves are going to have a view about exactly how rapidly they're looking to grow their own books of business and how rapidly they're looking to grow their engagement with us. And so those are essentially the moving piece parts. And in the middle of all of that, our goal is to become an increasingly relevant part of what it is that they do. So certainly, if there were opportunities to trade off price with volume, we would take a look at those because we want to be a leader. And this is a moment where we're introduced to new customers that we haven't worked with before, and we're expanding relationships with existing accounts, and all of that is -- it's very dynamic. And we're open to what the right way to go about optimizing that going forward.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then, I guess, just within the healthcare space as well, I mean, and in line with your commentary around an active M&A pipeline, can you maybe talk specifically on how you see your mix shifting towards maybe a little more M&A now that you've been a couple of years so without doing much in that space?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. Well, as you know, 2012 was actually a very active year for us in M&A. So there was a little bit of -- we needed to fulfill our commitments with respect to our leverage, and we accomplished that. But otherwise, we remain as active in them M&A process as we've ever been. We -- and I would just underline that we continue to be thoughtful about what we think is the right assets, and we're certainly looking hard at what are fair valuations. I think it's fair to say that in this time of relatively cheap money, valuations have tended to move up. There have been several transactions this year around assets that, from the headline level, at least you would have said, \"Gee, isn't that really logical for Verisk.\" But as we looked at them, we thought very long and hard about valuation and what we thought was the right way to use our shareholders' money and in some cases, took a pass. But we're as active as ever, and we remain very committed to the M&A agenda as part of long-term value creation here.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just, Mark, finally on the mortgage side, can you -- what is the mix between forensic and the front-end piece? And just to clarify, in your comments, you said that the front end, the one tied to originations was down as much as the market was?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "That is correct. So what we've seen is, at one point, the forensic was as much as 60% of the business. I think we're kind of trending towards that 50-50 at this point. And to clarify, yes, we have seen a lower or lighter decline on the forensic side. And with regard to the front end of the business, which is more closely tied to originations, it was kind of down consistent with what has been a drop in the overall market in the a number of originations there.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Could you give us a sense of, Scott, of the performance of some of your acquisitions in revenue and quality intelligence? That seems to be the area within healthcare where you've been most active from M&A standpoint, in particular MediConnect. As you look at the properties you've acquired over the last couple of years, have they performed about in line with your buy plan?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "They have, yes. They -- and one of the things that we talked about a couple of quarters ago, actually, when we were characterizing MediConnect upfront, was that we thought that something unique would happen when we put MediConnect together with the assets of what we used to call HRP because essentially we were now sort of fulfilling a value chain where it began with chart abstraction and ends with the analytics to support the payer in making their argument for their cost and quality outcomes. And so we had -- we were putting all of those assets together. And in fact, what we saw over the course, particularly of third and fourth quarter 2012 and first and second quarter of 2013, was that some demand was essentially liberated by virtue of our ability to provide that end-to-end solution. And you certainly saw that in our results and in the substantial organic growth that took place there. That effect continues to occur, and that's why we believe that we're going to have a very healthy level of growth in the healthcare business next year. But there was sort of a moment in time response to a capability that just was not there for us prior to the 2 assets coming together. And each of them individually has continued to do well. MediConnect has very much been operating according to plan.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Good. And just as a quick follow-up, historically, you don't provide growth rates for the 3 segments within healthcare. But in light of the slowdown this quarter, can you give us just some broad ranges on growth for Enterprise Analytics, Payment Accuracy, and revenue and quality intelligence?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "This is Mark. I mean, I think we tried to characterize earlier the nature of the growth there, it has been primarily driven by some of the RQI. The other 2 businesses have continued to perform nicely but not at the levels of RQI.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So all 3 businesses actually grew within healthcare in the quarter?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "All businesses were strong. As we kind of think about the businesses, we think there's opportunities across the board, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Clark with KBW.", "William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just one more on healthcare. How long is the typical implementation in RQI? So if you get those 3 customers locked in, how long would it normally take for us to see a meaningful contribution to the top line there?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "It's sort of weeks to months. So it's -- and it all depends on -- in many ways, it actually depends on the nature of the customer's operations. But think of it as several weeks to sort of a low count in terms of number of months.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.", "Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "In the past, you guys talked about seasonality in the healthcare business. Is there anything we should be thinking about as we model healthcare for next year?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "I think the one thing that we are trying to do, so we get a little bit away from some of the seasonally is we have tried to work with our customers so there wouldn't be quite as much kind of second half demand so that the opportunity and their needs are spread more broadly across the entire year. I think we've been somewhat successful there, but I think you're going continue to see more in the second half of the year. Typically, that was in that 60% to 70% range. So hopefully, we're trending towards the lower percentage there as we're thinking about that in the future.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'll now turn the call back over to Scott for closing remarks.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Okay. Well, we appreciate everybody being with us for the call. We appreciate all the questions, and we certainly understand the interest in our -- the healthcare part of our business. We remain focused on making it a really very strong and important part of Verisk. It's a long march but one in which we're very confident. We're also very excited about a lot of other things happening in our business. And the agenda remains focused on innovation, and we believe that we are becoming an increasingly strong company with respect to innovation and growth. And so we look forward to being with you again next quarter, and thanks for your time today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call.

Ma'am, please go ahead.", "Eva Huston", "", "Thank you Chantey. Good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions.", "All numbers we discuss today unless otherwise stated will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx, our mortgage services business which we announced in February we\u2019re selling. Interthinx is classified as discontinued operations. In our 10K filing revenue is reported from continuing operations only but EBITDA is shown including Interthinx as per the SEC requirements.

Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "And now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott Stephenson", "", "Thank you Eva. Good morning everyone. The results we reported last night were in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter. We\u2019re confident our long term prospects remain excellent and we continue to run the business with that time horizon in mind. Our view on this has been and will remain consistent. Our long term management of the business and our determination to innovate are very well aligned given that innovation works in long cycles. We\u2019re eager to continue to invest in our innovation agenda which we expect to drive both top line and free cash flow growth overtime. We remain focused on our twin goals of organic growth through innovation and operating with efficiency and scalability. As you know we made several strategic moves over the past several months announcing the acquisition of EagleView Technologies Corporation or EVT and the sale of our mortgage services business Interthinx.", "We continue to focus on being good stewards of our capital. On January 14, we announced the signing of an agreement to acquire EVT for a purchase price of $650 million. EVT is the parent company of both Pictometry International, a recognized leader in imagery, and EagleView which is well-known in the insurance industry. EVT is a leader in imagery analytics offering solutions in the property and casualty, contractor governance and commercial spaces.", "While the nascent imagery business today is fragmented and populated by some large companies. We believe our expertise and experience offer an opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the use of imagery and solutions that enhance the efficiency of our customers\u2019 businesses.", "EVT has over 1 million square miles of images in the United States, covering 85% of the population and 90% of our structures, a very valuable asset with over 20 petabytes of data that has taken years to build.", "As a reminder we see the natural development of the solution is moving from a catastrophe focus today to include non-cat claims, underwriting customers and commercial property risks. By combining EVTs claims solutions built on their comprehensive library of images with our own extensive insurance customer base and our industry knowledge, we can enhance the selling of these claims solutions in the insurance market, as well as move to develop automated underwriting solutions which do not exist today.", "Customer reactions to our pending combination has been positive. As we discussed last month on the call regarding the acquisition EVT will be integrated into our Xactware division under the leadership of Jim Loveland. The regulatory and shareholder approval processes are underway, and we expect integration to begin soon as the transaction closes. As we have stated our strategy is to allocate capital to the highest return opportunities for shareholders and EVT is one of these opportunities.", "The business has grown strongly leveraging the foundation of the government and municipal businesses into new markets in insurance and other commercial segments and we have significant opportunity to continue to grow the business, both in the United States and we believe over time, internationally. We remain consistent in our approach to acquisitions and we are focused on the strategic importance of the business to Verisk as the key driver in our decision to require EVT.", "We remain focused on our core principle of creating shareholder value through innovation, discipline and execution. Earlier this month we signed a definitive agreement to sell our mortgage services business Interthinx to First American Financial Corporation for a price of $155 million cash subject to typical adjustments for among other things, the working capital of the business. We are currently awaiting regulatory approval, and expect to close by March 31.", "Our IRR on our mortgage services business based on sale price of $155 million was greater than our typical 15% hurdle and similar to our return experience for our overall acquisition portfolio, which has IRR's of over 20% using our conservative, 10 times EBITDA terminal value. The sale of Interthinx will allow us to focus on businesses most closely aligned with our strategy of providing proprietary data analytics into our key verticals. The Interthinx's leadership team, headed by Jeff Moyer has done an excellent job responding to changes in the mortgage market and we wish them continued success as part of First American.", "In yesterday's press release we provide pro forma historical financial results, excluding Interthinx which should help you in thinking about the shape of our businesses and our financial profile going forward. Also last quarter at Verisk Health we put a new leadership team in place, led by Nadine Hays which occurred after our update on our financial outlook. I'm pleased to tell you that our team was 100% focused on execution during Verisk Health\u2019s busiest time of year, which concluded on February 14th. We satisfied our customer\u2019s volumes expectations in the quarter.", "To put this in perspective, Verisk Health\u2019s volume in its Medicare advantage business increased nicely in 2013 and this within a market that is fast-growing, in light of the baby boomer population's progression toward Medicare eligibility. This is the time of year when Medicare advantage plans were to meet a deadline related to submitting documentation to substantiate the health status of their patients. This documentation directly drives the revenue yield our customers realize in connection with the illness burden of the patient population they manage. As you know, helping our customers drive their own revenue growth within Medicare advantage is an important part of our business.", "A positive result of the Verisk Health\u2019s focus was that it allowed us to deliver revenue for the quarter, just above the high end of our forecast, ensuring a quality outcome on a tight time table for our customers did require a somewhat higher than planned expense level. But Nadine and her team are working very hard on demand planning with our customers to ensure that in 2014 we stand ready to meet our customer\u2019s volume requirements while improving profitability.", "We have more work to do at Verisk Health\u2019s and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity. We also believe that we are on the right track to ensure that business as a whole is built for the scale necessary to meet the healthcare opportunity. We continue to manage the business to mid-teens growth in 2014 as we discussed with you last quarter. You will have a chance to hear about the business from Nadine directly at our upcoming investor day.", "On a topic of investing for the future, we were very excited as we went through the 2014 budget cycle to see the number of ideas coming from our business units for creating new solutions and enhancing existing ones. We are fortunate to be able to green light many of these initiatives with the expectation of also maintaining strong margins.", "In the fourth quarter of 2013 we delivered results which were in line with our expectations with total revenue growth of 7% all organic and a decline in diluted adjusted EPS of about 11% largely due to tax benefits seen in the prior period which did not recur in the current period. Full-year revenue and diluted adjusted EPS grew about 13% and 9% respectively. Our consolidated organic revenue growth for the full year was about 9%. Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin, excluding Interthinx of 45.4% in the quarter and 46.7% for the full year. The margins were down versus the prior year as a result of investments we have been discussing with you and increased spending to meet customer demand at Verisk Health.", "In the quarter we returned capital to our shareholders to stock repurchases of about $117 million. We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. Even with the acquisition of EVT we remain active in looking at M&A. We continue to focus on assets with the strategic set of strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects and with that let me turn it over Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.", "Mark Anquillare", "", "Thanks Scott. For the fourth quarter we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, we\u2019re also investing in the future. Revenue grew 7.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 all organic in 13.3% for the fiscal year 2013. Excluding the effect of 2012 acquisitions revenue grew 8.5% from fiscal year 2013.", "Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 7.6% in the fourth quarter of 2013 all organic. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in financial services primarily contributions from our Argus, which is now all organic. For the full year Decision Analytics revenue grew 18% and 9.8% on an organic basis. Within Decision Analytics our insurance category grew 7.3% for the fourth quarter of 2013 all organic, the increase was driven by strong growth in catastrophe modeling and insurance fraud claims solutions, whilst quantification solutions also added to the revenue growth. Overall growth was driven by the increased adoption of existing and new solutions and annual invoice increases for certain solutions.", "We\u2019re pleased we\u2019re delivering acceleration in combined insurance revenue growth in 2013 consistent with our comment at the beginning of the year. Full year 2013 combined all RA and DA insurance revenue growth while 7.8% all organic.", "In the financial services category, revenue grew 25.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013 for all organic and after classifying Interthinx as a discontinued operation. We sold both the automated and the forensic pieces of the mortgage business. We did retain a small business focus on portfolio analytics in the consumer loan space which is aligned with and will now be part of Argus.", "Revenue increases were driven by demand of our analytic solutions and services. For the full year 2013 on a pro forma basis financial service revenue from continuing operations which is Argus and retain strategic analytics business grew 26.3%, Argus is a very ISO like business and serves as a trusted neutral intermediary using a contributory data model to upgrade analytics which are deeply embedded in our customer\u2019s processes. The growth outlook at Argus remains positive. Including through international expansion and partnering opportunities as well as additional penetration of the existing customers. However we\u2019re mindful of the larger base against which Argus will be growing in 2014.", "In the healthcare vertical, revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6.9% all organic driven by growth across all the divisions led by Medicare Advantage related services. The results were a little better than expected as we\u2019re able to meet customer demand. This came across with negative impact on fourth quarter DA margins although margins in healthcare remained healthy and scaling. As Scott mentioned we\u2019re working with Verisk Health team to better prepare for future demand of our solutions. We continue to be excited about the opportunity in healthcare space and we expect growth to remain well above the corporate average.", "We continue to manage towards mid-teens growth in 2014 and are working with our customers to jointly improve demand planning. In the specialized markets category, revenue declined 3.1% for the fourth quarter 2013 but grew 0.3% from full year. Good growth in the quarter EH&S and commercial weather in climate analytics were more than offset by lower activity related to government contract customers. The quarter came in better than we expected due to unanticipated project revenue in the environmental health and safety space. We\u2019re pleased to see continuing traction in our efforts to repurpose our intellectual property to meet strong demand from P&C customers and think our formation of Verisk Climate will enhance our ability to capitalize on that. We think about AER and 3E\u2019s options on the growing list of analytics on climate and supply chain and see them as longer term elements of our growth strategy.", "Turning to risk assessment, for the fourth quarter we reported revenue growth of 6.7% all organic indicating the value to our long standing insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment is due in part to 4.5% revenue growth in industry-related insurance programs result in primarily from the continued annual effective growth in 2013 invoices effective January 1.", "Property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 14.7% in fourth quarter, growth as a result of new sales at higher committed volumes and incremental revenue contributions due to the expiring revenue sharing agreement with the technology provider in fourth quarter of 2012. Full year, risk assessment grew 6.7% driven by a 4.5% growth in industry standard insurance programs and 14.2% in property specific rating and underwriting information.", "For the fourth quarter 2013 EBITDA excluding Interthinx grew 1.4% to a 189.3 million with an EBITDA margin excluding Interthinx at 45.4%. For fiscal year 2013 EBITDA excluding Interthinx grew 11% to 744.8 million. The EBITDA margin excluding Interthinx of 46.7%", "There are some moving parts in 4Q related to our expectations. Our spending on aerial imagery in the quarter was below lower than planned as we deferred some image capture. However as I mentioned earlier we spent more than planned at Verisk Health in support of customer demand to meet deadlines. We have talked recently about the transaction nature of some of the Verisk Health business and that played a role. In addition the new leadership team at Verisk Health recognized the need for some operational adjustments to support variable customer demand and to move certain functions towards greater automation.", "We still have work to do but the team only stands what needs to be done in executing against that plan. Decision Analytics EBITDA excluding Interthinx declined 5% in fourth quarter of 2013 and risk assessment EBITDA grew 9.7% versus same period in the prior year. Fiscal year 2013 EBITDA for DA excluding Interthinx grew 12.1% and risk assessment EBITDA grew 9.7%.", "The fourth quarter of 2013 EBITDA margin excluding Interthinx for Decision Analytics decreased 38.5% from 43.6% in fourth quarter 2012 because of higher cost to meet transactional demand. The fiscal year 2013 EBITDA margin excluding Interthinx in Decision Analytics was 40.7% versus 42.8% in fiscal year in 2012.", "The fourth quarter 2013 EBITDA margin in risk assessment increased 57% from 55.5% in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the previously discussed revenue growth and good expense management. For fiscal year 2013 EBITDA margin risk assessment was 56.1% versus 54.6% in fiscal year 2012.", "As you know following our divesture of Interthinx our margins are higher than they used to be. As we look forward we\u2019re still comfortable with 2014 our EBITDA margins will be flattish versus 2013 EBITDA margins from continuing operations.", "Over the long term we believe reasonable range for EBITDA margins is 45% to 47%. We expect the middle of this range would be our reference point as we think about investing opportunities in the future.", "Our interest expense was down 3 million in the fourth quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This decrease was due to the repayment with cash from operations at a 180 million from private placement debt that matured during 2013. We ended the fourth quarter with total debt for about 1.3 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. As we discussed we anticipate using our revolver in cash on hand as well as proceeds from the sale of Interthinx on the purchase of EVT.", "We estimated the after tax proceeds from the sale of Interthinx will be approximately a 125 million. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% for the quarter which was higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 due to a onetime tax planning benefits in the prior period. As discussed over the past several quarters we have been actively working on our tax planning strategy and realized benefits in both 2012 and 2013 from them. Consequently our full year 2013 effective tax rate was the same as 2012 rate of 36.5%.", "In 2014 without the one-time benefits, we anticipate the rates to normalize around 38.5%. Adjusted net income decline 11.5% for the fourth quarter 2013 and increased 9.5% for the fiscal year 2013, declining the fourth quarter was largely due to tax benefits seen in the prior period which did not recur in the current period.", "The average diluted share count was a 171.7 million shares in the quarter. On December 31, 2013 our diluted share count was 171.1 million shares. In the quarter we repurchased about 1.8 million shares for about a $116.9 million. At quarter end we had about a 165.3 million left under our authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to-date generating IRRs of over 25%.", "For 2014 we continue to anticipate at a minimum buying shares offset dilution.", "Turning to our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2013 our cash and cash equivalents were about 165.8 million, total debt both short term and long term totaled about 1.3 billion. Today our incremental tax capacity is over a $1 billion and it will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our debt to pro forma EBITDA at December 31 was 1.7 times below our steady-state target. With the acquisition of EVT and sale of Interthinx we anticipate our leverage to rise to about 2.3 times.", "We will delever back to our target of 4 to 5 quarters after the close of EVT. As you know we\u2019re willing to temporarily go above our long term target of 2 times debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because of our free cash is strong and allows us to delever quickly.", "In 2013 free cash flow which we define as cash from operations of capital expenditures was 349.4 million and decrease of about 10% versus 2013. Free cash flow for 2013 is adjusted to the timing of excess tax benefits and prior year voluntary pension contribution was 394.6 million reflecting it's climb to 2.7% compared to prior year.", "Our capital expenditures were a 107.5 million in 2013 consistent with what we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow represented 46% of EBITDA in 2013 lower than our historic average of 65% to 60% due to the increased CapEx.", "As you will see in our 10K, our expectation for CapEx for 2014 is a 147 million down meaningfully from a 158 million in 2013. This is consistent with our comments during 2013 at but the elevated CapEx was temporary. Although we continue to expect a greater use of capitalized software related to new solutions will modestly raise the capital intensity of our business when compared to historic trends.", "We continue to aim to grow free cash flow at or above for level of our EBITDA growth. As you think about your models for full year 2014 we anticipate amortization and tangibles was about $57 million. Fixed asset D&A of about $75 million to $80 million, the tax rate around 38.5%.", "We aim to keep share count flat through our repurchase program. In a current debt balances our quarterly interest rate expense is about $17 million to $18 million. As we said on the EVT call in January you can model the debt cost associated with the acquisition of about 5.5%, net of the Interthinx sale we anticipate borrowing about $475 million although that number can change based on time of the close. After the close of EVT transaction we will update you.", "Overall our business is performing well and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and we continue to invest for the future. With that I would like to ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co", "The insurance vertical as a whole. I know you talked about it accelerated this year on a full-year basis, but it was a little slower in the fourth quarter. So I guess two parts of the question. One is what was a little slower in the fourth quarter versus what you saw in the third quarter, which was very strong and as you look forward here to 2014, is the growth rate you saw in 2013 something that accelerated pace, something you can sustain or would we see a step back towards more I guess the growth trends you've seen in the last couple years?", "Mark Anquillare", "First of all I think we feel very good about insurance, we delivered this year on kind of some strong organic growth, I think we feel well positioned for 2014, as you were to think about the quarter relative to third quarter we did highlight the fact that there was some onetime lurk that was done in third quarter that we probably make a little bit of an consistency between third and four [ph]. Going back to 2012 there is a lot of pluses and minuses there, I think the general trend is one that we look to across the year and it was a positive one. There is nothing that is systematic that would cause you to be a concern that this quarter was below what it was a year ago.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co", "Okay. And is the underwriting group, you usually you have mentioned, highlighted that as a source of strength for the last few quarters, but it wasn't mentioned.", "Mark Anquillare", "I think the answer to your question we continue to see improved growth in underwriting in the quarter just quite up to what we had seen in the first three quarters of the year in a little bit to the point I made just a moment ago.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co", "Okay. And then just on healthcare, can you help me understand what type of cost you needed to add? I guess maybe I overestimated how automated of a business it was, but I guess where was the extra cost that you needed to put to bear and I guess a little more color on the operational changes you described. The new management side.", "Scott Stephenson", "There is a couple of things but particularly with respect to the Medicare Advantage business which is the part which is very transaction oriented, there are activities related to chart retrieval and then coding in order to abstract the data out of the chart and those are the things which have to flex up as the unit volumes go up and that\u2019s what we had to put more time and energy into and that is one of the aspects of the business as Mark was mentioning before that we\u2019re working to achieve the highest possible level of automation.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co", " ", "Okay. And is that something if you knew earlier you would have been able to spread the cost out? Is that the comment that I guess if you planned ahead?", "Scott Stephenson", "Well we do plan ahead.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co", "Well, if the client had planned ahead and told you I guess.", "Scott Stephenson", "It's more of that, that\u2019s right. I mean there is an aspect of the actual volume that we work which is in reaction to our customers. We want to be supportive of them because they are our own business result hinges upon what we do. So and they have a greater volume it's our desire to respond to it. We don\u2019t always know from them exactly what those volumes are going to be, so we try to remain a little bit nimble and able to flex with them.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co", "Okay. And just to finalize that, was your comment that the margins, they were still scaling? So can I take that for the full year the margins still improved in the healthcare business?", "Scott Stephenson", "Right.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital", "Just on the health, one more thing. I mean you guys I guess you mentioned in there that the busiest period I guess ended February 14. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that and I guess with that in context, any commentary on how first quarter should shape up sequentially?", "Scott Stephenson ", "Yeah so let me kick off there as we have mentioned in the past there is a seasonality to the work that we\u2019re doing, in fact different aspects of what we\u2019re doing Verisk Health have different seasonal cycles. But there is a back half quality to what it is that we do in the healthcare space overall and we would expect that to continue to be the case this year.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital", "I guess so this busy period you talked about though, that was just specific to one area then? I was just trying to understand why that was the busiest time.", "Scott Stephenson", "Well there is in the Medicare Advantage stage there is a process by which the Medicare Advantage plans have to make their submissions to CMS in order to drive their revenue outcome and all of that times out this year it times out on February the 14, and so there is a lot of activity through the end of Q4 and even a little bit into the first quarter just try to respond to that deadline and that\u2019s what we were referring to.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital", "Okay, all right. And then just on Argus, I mean obviously it continues to perform really well. I guess you have a little bit tougher comps, so you maintain mid-teens. But can you just help us understand some of the I guess the drivers near term that have been leading that solid growth?", "Scott Stephenson", "Well there are multitude of ways in which the Argus business grows which is one of the reasons why it's such a wonderful business in addition to the extremely propriety nature of the data they have got but the business consists of multiple sets of solutions that are provided to retail banks which include the basically the contributory data studies analytic solutions and a suite of services which are built around the analytics solutions as well as actually licensing the analytic platform that we have built back to some of our customers and all of that in the context of the opportunity to grow the business globally. In addition to all of that we\u2019re increasingly finding ways to try to repurpose the data to tie in what\u2019s happening in the retail banking channel with what\u2019s happening in other vertical markets to specifically into the world of trying to observe patterns of consumer spending and how they respond to promotion and advertising whether it's broadcast or online.", "And all of those are part of the Argus story and will continue to be as we go forward.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo.", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "With healthcare coming in as strong as it did and Argus as well, do you think it would be as we look out to organic growth for the rest of the year, do you think we've come to a point where we've basically troughed and for total Company organic growth we will see some gradual improvement over the year?", "Scott Stephenson", "We\u2019re feeling good about the business though and we\u2019re very focused on organic growth and one of the things I would just say is that our case is built on a very broad base. There are I mean we basically do not accept that any part of our business is mature. And so even within the longest standing solution sets we've got, we are asking for innovation and new forms of value for our customer. So we\u2019re looking in a case which is built very broadly across the entire company.", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And I also wanted to ask for an update on the pooled data initiative, just how many organizations are participating and how effective it has been at reducing fraud in healthcare and is it generating any revenue or when do you have plans for it to do that?", "Scott Stephenson", "Right, so we\u2019re still in the early stages. Last time we talked about we reported that we had two companies participating that\u2019s still where we\u2019re at but we do have a couple of name brands companies that are deep into conversation with us and this is very definitely one of those network effect businesses and so as we can get more companies into the process the value is going to grow not arithmetically but more geometrically. Even so even with the first two we\u2019re very encouraged by the amount of value that we have been able to point to for our first two beta customers in relatively short period of time. So we\u2019re very encouraged.", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "Got it and a couple of quick housekeeping questions. One was just the share count exiting the fourth quarter and the other was I didn't know if I caught what you thought the kind of ongoing organic growth rate for Argus next one, two years would be. Sort of mid-teens, is that the way to think about it or?", "Mark Anquillare", "So let me take on a couple of questions, the share count and you asked specifically where the share count was at the end of the year that was 171.1.", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "That's fully diluted?", "Mark Anquillare", "Highlighted that we would try to buy back shares to minimize any dilution at a minimum\u2026", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "Got it.", "Mark Anquillare", "In the year. I think we continue to feel very good about Argus, we highlighted that, we continue to feel that. There is multiple ways that they can expand both internationally into some new customer set as well as some new verticals as Scott highlighted. On a bigger base so we\u2019re cautiously optimistic and I think we continue and kind of live by the mid-teens that we talked about.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.", "Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase", "I wanted to ask about the trajectory of Verisk Health as we go throughout 2014, kind of starting with the 7% in fourth quarter 2013. Do we feel like it is going to be a progressive, rather smooth acceleration through the year to make mid-teens for the full year? And then my second part of the question is does Verisk Health need additional healthcare wins to get there or is this really just ramping existing contracts?", "Scott Stephenson", "Let me take the second question first and then I will turn it over to Mark for the first one about the profile but the way that we have built our view of 2014 is by looking at all of the customer relationships in place by the end of 2013 and having a I think a good view of how those are going to perform in 2014 and then taking a risk adjusted view of what we believe that sales pipeline is going to yield in 2014 and the very large majority upto 2014 case is built on the performance of business is already in place as we rounded the corner out of \u201913 and into \u201914. So that\u2019s how we came up with our view of where we\u2019re at and Mark if you want to talk about sort of the profile in \u201914?", "Mark Anquillare", "Sure. I wish I can tell you it's a smooth ramp, I think it will continue to be a little bit of an up and down. Let me describe it a little bit why, first of all I think we already highlighted this because of the sweeps is focused on satisfying our customers\u2019 demands around submitting the reimbursement, everything happens or a lot happens in the second half of the year. That is typically being around that 55% to 60% so continue to keep that in mind and what we\u2019re doing this year in \u201914 is trying to demand capacity plans hopefully little more effectively with our customers which would even out some of the volumes there between third and fourth quarter.", "So I wish I could give you pointed information but I would continue to think about bias towards second half of the year with regards to overall revenue and third and fourth quarter hopefully we have a little bit more capacity planning which would drive a little more revenue in the third quarter, a little less in the fourth.", "Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase", "And this is all about RQI, I mean the comments you just made really fit RQI's profile, right?", "Mark Anquillare", "That is the variable aspect of the healthcare business, that\u2019s true.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "I hate to kind of pepper you with more healthcare questions, but I'm doing it anyway I guess. With regard to the transactional versus subscription nature of the business, you made some moves I think in the, you talked about in the third quarter to transition the business or to push it in the direction of recurring subscription revenue. It sounds like perhaps in 2014 we are not going to see much of an impact of those initiatives. I guess that would be the first part of the question. And then the second is it sounds like to the extent you had some volume ramp delays that affected the third quarter, you feel pretty confident that those are behind you at this point?", "Scott Stephenson", "So let me take that on, first of all I don\u2019t want to over characterize in sort of any given period the degree to which we can actually shift the revenue mix from transactional to subscription. So you may be thinking about comments we have made where we would always have that in mind as a goal and over longer periods of time our experience has been that in data analytics business you do tend to move with time from transactional to subscription, partly because our customers would like to have relatively greater certainty about what it is that they are going to be paying us through time.", "So that is a general view that we have on the business and a general ambition that we would have for the business, but we would not want to over characterize our ability in any given period to move the market in that way because particularly with something like Medicare Advantage where you have had such substantial expansion in transaction volumes, our customers would not really know exactly how to project where individually they're headed and therefore they wouldn't really know how to write subscription contract around that. So you may have heard us express that as a preference but I don't want to give you the impression that that's something that we feel can be moved around, you know, particularly strongly at any given moment in time.", "And with respect to what went on in the business in the fourth quarter when we were talking about third quarter we had talked about four accounts in particular and we can report that actually that\u2019s the cumulative effect of those four accounts in the fourth quarter was actually slightly above what we had expected.", "Mark Anquillare", "Maybe I can just add to real quickly to the characterization, what we tried to put in place was long term contracts that had committed volume minimums. So those minimums there that gives us comfort it also gives us a long term relationship but inside those committed minimums they are full year minimums so just trying to get from our customers that capacity it's smooth over the year, it still continues to be they give it to us as they think\u2026", "Scott Stephenson", "In addition to which our ambition is to outperform the minimums and in some cases substantial.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "And Scott, if you just take a sort of high-level view of the healthcare business given all the moving pieces, would you kind of characterize 2014 as a transition year or work in progress year because it sounds like there are some ongoing investments or adjustments that you are making at the same time that your revenue growth continues to be pretty robust? And do we think about the business perhaps evolving and maybe even taking on a more a different complexion, a more mature complexion from a margin standpoint as we get into \u201815? Is that kind of directionally the way to think about it?", "Scott Stephenson", "I think that we are and will remain an evolving organization for some time just by way of reference and I think most of you know this but in 2013 our healthcare business was five times larger than it was three years prior in 2010. So there has been a great deal of growth. And obviously we\u2019re intending to continue to grow the business and growth implies that we\u2019re going to be creating a solution that we\u2019re going to be improving the processes and the products that we already have out in the marketplace and on top of which the really important contextual point here we have a business that is material now inside of Verisk and yet at the same time when you look at the healthcare space overall we\u2019re still a small to midsize. There are several companies which are in the data analytics space who are larger than we\u2019re, and so we still have a long way to go I guess it's the way that I would put it and lots of opportunities to try to continue to improve the way we do what it is we do whether it's acquiring yet more proprietary data or enhancing the automation inside of what is that we do and as our colleagues inside of our healthcare business know every time we\u2019re together and we\u2019re together a lot talking about the business it's basically about how can we continue to reinvent this business through data analytics and enhanced processes and so I think there will continue to be opportunities to do that over longer periods of time.", "It's still an evolving and dynamic business and that\u2019s in that is where the growth opportunity exists.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Suzanne Stein of Morgan Stanley.", "Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley", "Can you go back to the insurance piece of Decision Analytics and the organic growth rate there? It dipped down in fourth quarter from a kind of 8% to 9% normalized range that it has been in the nine months prior. How are you thinking about 2014? Are you looking for a further deceleration in that segment or are there trends in the P&C end market that give you confidence it could trend higher?", "Mark Anquillare", "I think I will just try to highlight that we continue to feel very good about the opportunities insurance and that\u2019s not just in well I call the DA businesses that goes across into risk assessment and we I think we continue to think about the opportunity being across a full spectrum of the insurance customers. We have optimism fourth quarter from your point it was down a bit in fourth quarter. I don\u2019t think there is anything systematic there, it was really a little bit inside of underwriting as we described and we have quite the growth there that we had in past. We continue to believe that all of those businesses including risk assessment have an opportunity to expand and grow. I will highlight one thing though as you think about risk assessment. We did have that service provider, that contract that expired in fourth quarter of 2012, it's about $12 million that will continue to be in our \u201914 numbers but \u201913 did experience a onetime growth because of that contract expiration.", "Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then on the buyback activity, it was bigger I think than it has been since 2011. Was there anything specific that drove that? And I guess given where your leverage is now, should we expect it to remain at an elevated level, just I guess assuming the stock remains in the range it is now?", "Mark Anquillare", "So in fourth quarter we kind of use our capital for the best way possible, we felt like it was good at time and a good buying opportunity which we did do. At the same time we have now placed some capital through the use of acquisitions, EVT specifically and at a minimum we\u2019re going to buy back shares to limit the dilution into 2014 that is our plan and we have just basically consistent targets that we continue to work through.", " ", "Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley", "And then maybe just one more on specialized markets. You mentioned that some of the better performance this quarter was project-related. Are you expecting this to continue in 2014 or was that more of an unusual fourth-quarter item?", "Mark Anquillare", "So I think what I will highlight is that sometimes those special projects do kind of move revenue into a quarter and it's good news but the fact that projects are there usually leads to more opportunity, more intense relationship. So although they are a little bit one time I think it kind of has some promising aspects to it and I feel that both EH&S and from a commercial perspective the world of climate, I think, provides us some upside into \u201914.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Togut from Evercore.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners", "Just piecing together your comments, Scott, and yours, Mark, as well with respect to margins; I think, Mark, you signaled that EBITDA margin would be flattish in 2014. And, Scott, you highlighted the focus on maximizing organic growth but also the operating leverage in the business. So as we look beyond 2014, would you anticipate that EBITDA margins would begin to expand again, or would you hold margins flat and max investment to continue to drive organic growth?", "Scott Stephenson", "So first of all going back to what Mark had mentioned before when you look at continuing ops what we said is we think that 2014 will be flattish relative to what they were in \u201913 for continuing ops. So that\u2019s kind of the near term horizon, the long term horizon is Mark did talk about the range being 45 to 47 and that we\u2019re kind of oriented around the midpoint. And the way we think about that is we are very determined to make sure that we see the top line growing organically while at the same time making sure that EBITDA and free cash are also advancing in-line and that free cash flow it's more than keeping up with EBITDA growth. So that\u2019s kind of the equation we\u2019re working and the sort of the good news about where we said is that as we ask for more innovation from the organization we\u2019re actually getting it and so we\u2019re in kind of in opportunity rich environment is what it feels like.", "And so we\u2019re leaning into the opportunities to invest. The one thing to bear in mind is that we are a business-to-business data analytics company. Our customers are sober minded, businesses who will diligence process and expect proof of concept before they buy into them and they should because they're trying to run their businesses with the steadiness and so the effect of all of that is that a great new solution can take a while to find it's way to market and so the balancing point then is we\u2019re investing today and innovation tends to commercialize over longish periods of time in an environment like ours and so those are all the things that we will be playing with as we try to advance the business top and bottom line.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners", "So does that mean EBITDA margins would likely be flattish in 2015 as well, as you continue to drive higher investment to innovate?", "Scott Stephenson", "Well we\u2019re still communicating the range that we talked about there, so we did talk 45 to 47 and we did talk about the midpoint being a reference for us and we\u2019re going to actually take a count of real-time conditions on the ground basically as we move into \u201915 and a lot of that has to do with just how innovative is our organization being.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners", "That makes good sense. I guess just drilling down into 2014 a little bit, it looks like you are getting very nice operating leverage on the risk assessment side and a lot of the investment is going into DA. Would you expect that to be the trend as well in 2014, where you get lift on the RA margin, and DA margin continues to be down as you drive a lot of investment in that business?", "Scott Stephenson", "So we really, one of the things that we talk about as frequently is that we really see the all of what we\u2019re doing insurance as an as an integrated whole. When we sit down with our customers, our largest customers. We don't really tend to have when we\u2019re having our relationship discussions they tend not to be focused on individual products whether they are RA or DA, it tends to really be the totality of relationship and so in that context what we\u2019re looking for is the overall result, the overall organic results and therefore the, we\u2019re certainly paying attention to what\u2019s happening with each of the products line but we\u2019re really looking for the overall result.", "All of that said I think that in DA I believe that the margins will be firm in 2014 relative to 2013. Firm plus but the exact outcome, we\u2019re kind of, we\u2019re adjusting as we go inside the context of customer relationships.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners", "Understood. A quick final question, Mark, on tax rate. What is your expectation for 2014?", "Mark Anquillare", "About 38.5, lot of good news one-time tax planning items are behind us and that is the new normalized lower rate going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs", "My first question, I was wondering if you could potentially provide an update on some of your previously discussed moves in the healthcare business to offer contracts with some lower prices in exchange for longer-term commitments. Is this something that you are continuing to pursue more widely across the business and are you finding it successful in locking in more customers?", "Scott Stephenson", "So I did comment earlier about for customer situations from the third quarter and for the way that that generally is played out in the fourth quarter. But we\u2019re generally, we\u2019re really led by where the customers are and there are some customers that are going to be more concerned about knowing that they have capacity to flex if they find that their own volumes are moving and there are others who want to try to cut it more closely in terms of sort of not really laying in capacity but rather sort of in essence taking the risk that their needs can be met even if they haven't signaled them with great precision beforehand and so in that sense we\u2019re just responding to what it is that the customers need and want, and I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m aware of any sort of major trends in that area one way or the other. Our preference always as I said before would be to have the certainty that it is associated with a license agreement and a subscription but that being our preference doesn\u2019t mean that we can necessarily make that happen in the marketplace where it can be done, that would be our preference but we\u2019re following our customers around in this regard.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs", "And with regard to the two existing customers in the pooling business, was there any expansion of those customers into additional geographies as I think you previously indicated that they were only doing business in certain regions? And are there any more specific anecdotes that you would be willing to provide on some of the types of savings and benefits that you've been able to provide, as you said, that the early read is that those relationships are going well?", "Scott Stephenson", "At Investor Day we\u2019re going to actually talk a little bit more about what\u2019s going on inside of the pool data initiative and I think you will benefit from hearing about that directly from our people in the business.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Just another question about healthcare margins. You said you'd put the Decision Analytics margins. You said you pushed out some of the investment in aerial. How much was that push out? And basically it sounds from the last question that we should expect DA margins maybe to be down in the first half and up in the second half and then maybe flattish to slightly positive year on year overall. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Mark Anquillare", "I\u2019m not sure we do those conclusions, let me just kind of go back at, we did spend a little less on aerial imagery as we kind of got towards the end of the year whether it's flying conditions or flight plans. There is an opportunity you know to not gather as much information as we had anticipated that they push off and we will push off into 2014 that is a fact. As far as the margins into 2014 I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to start commenting by quarter I think we tried to give you a little bit of color for \u201914, we have a view that this should be generally flattish. Scott highlighted that from a DA perspective we will see some scale there so he has talked about flattish plus and from an RA perspective I think we do kind of expect and see a little bit of some ramping investment in RA. So probably you won't see the same type of scale in RA in \u201914 that probably saw on \u201913 that was overall characterization.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "And then just on that aerial push out, does that mean it is coming in the first quarter or any way to size that just so we can try to model it?", "Mark Anquillare", "Yeah I\u2019m not sure we exactly know the timing of that right now, it's certainly in the first half of \u201914, yes.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "And then, finally, the 45% to 47%, I think that's a new target. Is that also going to be the target, I think your old bonus target was 43% to 45%. Is 45% to 47% the new bonus target?", "Scott Stephenson", "We\u2019re always taking into account all the moving parts in the business. So we will be working on that with our Board and the comp [ph] committee et cetera to determine where the target should be put but generally we want the targets to reflect the reality of where the business is. We will definitely spend time on that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital.", "Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets", "Just wanted to quickly circle back to your comments about the pricing environment and the fact that you respond to what your customers want. Was that a comment just for the healthcare business or is that something you are seeing in terms of maybe potential changes across your other verticals as well?", "Scott Stephenson", "So there is actually I think two questions in there Jeff so let me try and grab them both. The first thing I would say is our preference which again would be we like to be in a subscription relationship and generally our experience has been overtime that\u2019s where our customers would like to be once they get a handle on their transaction volumes so that with confidence could know in essence what they are signing up for when they sign the subscription agreement because if you\u2019re going to enter into an all you can drink kind of a relationship you would like to know how much you\u2019re likely to drink and what the alternative would look like if you can get it on a per drink basis.", "So that\u2019s the preference when we actually look at our business. I would say that there are puts and takes, the healthcare business has off late it has grown more on the transactional side. On the other hand, when we look at say diversified financial services, there have been some gains there with respect to subscriptions and I think that in insurance space I think it is highly committed and stable actually and actually we have made some gains in say the commercial property part of our business. So there is puts and takes but I think at the margin I would say outside of healthcare we\u2019re probably becoming slightly more subscription oriented.", "Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets", "And can you just remind us when you think the EVT transaction will be closing?", "Scott Stephenson", "Well what we have put out there is by the end of the second quarter and we have mentioned that we are paced by two things one is regulatory approval and the other is just working through with the shareholders who are the current owners of EVT but that\u2019s the track that we think we\u2019re on. July kind of early July would actually be the very specific target.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse", "Unidentified Analyst ", "This is (indiscernible) dialing in for Hamzah Mazari. Just a couple quick questions. Could you provide any color on pricing increases that you saw in the quarter and for 2014 versus how they've fared in the past?", "Scott Stephenson ", "You mean across the entire business?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes.", "Mark Anquillare", "Let me take the first, I think that many of our businesses don\u2019t really institute price increases as I think about healthcare as an example. Maybe focus in a little bit on is inside of our P&C business, some of our traditional industry standard programs we have kind of a January one invoice that comes out. I think what we have tried to do is we have highlighted time and time again and said we think of insurance customers are selling and buying a large group of products from us and those invoices around industry standard programs, we've tried to keep the approach consistent. ", "We haven't done anything that would cause them, you have to really think too hard about those invoices, we want them to think about new products in extension of solution across the full suite of the enterprise in Verisk. So business as usual I would say on the risk assessment side of pricing and that would be true of also our what I call claims search invoices that's inside of our Decision Analytics set of solutions for insurance.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And the next question that I had is just post the EagleView deal, how should we think about the acquisition pipeline and which areas you might be most looking to augment going forward?", "Scott Stephenson", "So first of all we remain very focused on that part of the agenda. We believe that it's been very value adding for our investors over a long period of time and as long as we continue to operate strategically inside of that agenda. We think it will continue to be a value creating for our shareholders. We see opportunities across all the vertical markets to try to support and amplify what it is that we\u2019re doing on the acquisition front.", "So I wouldn\u2019t really buttonhole it anywhere. As we have said in the past because of where we fit in the healthcare space today there are certainly a very large number of companies out there that would logically be on our radar screen and at Investor Day we will talk a little bit more also about the way that we partner in order to relate to that world. And so partnering is also sort of an early step in the M&A agenda. But we see it as a very broad based, a very broad based kind of activity. If I was to point at any trends I suppose there would be and you can just see this in what we have done the size of the deals have gotten somewhat larger and I think that\u2019s likely to remain the case, that\u2019s not to say that we won't do smaller tuck-ins but our deal size has gotten somewhat bigger and I think it's likely to continue to be that way. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of William Clark with KBW. ", "William Clark - KBW", "Scott, I think you have kind of touched on this, but just wanted to make sure I was clear. So the three customers that were slow to switch over in the Medicare Advantage business in third quarter, they all switched over in the fourth quarter and you saw no additional issues in terms of the timing of bringing new customers on board? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Scott Stephenson", "What I said very specifically was we talked about four customer situations on our third quarter call. Three of them were about the timing of getting started and one of them was about volume responding to pricing and the comment that I made was the net effect of all four of those was to be performing somewhat higher than we actually expected going into the fourth.", " ", "William Clark - KBW", "Okay. And then given the February date you mentioned, a lot of the CMS activity has to be done by, now that we are past that date, is this a time when you generally see more or less activity in terms of customers thinking about changing or switching providers?", "Scott Stephenson", "I don\u2019t really think of it as being bound up exactly in that. If you\u2019re talking about existing products to existing customers, I feel like in essence we\u2019re constantly being diligent by the marketplace and there is such a strong relationship and this is going really be highlighted when we\u2019re with you on Investor Day by our healthcare team. There is such a strong relationship between the quality of our execution and our growth opportunity and so our customers are perpetually able to observe how we\u2019re executing and delivering for them and I think that they are kind of constantly taking that into account as they think about how much work they want to do with us.", "And we talked before about the fact that we have got a wide range of solutions and a big part of our opportunity is to cross sell those solutions and so again I\u2019m just back to if we execute and I think our execution is very evident to our customers then that is supportive of our opportunity to introduce new products. So I don\u2019t think of it is bound up in any given moment in time.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit, I know you made the changes at the management level in healthcare. Can you talk about any processes and/or functions with the new manager in place there that they are looking at and there might be some changes in?", "Scott Stephenson", "We are paying a lot of attention to way that the business actually operates. Our growth opportunity is not a function of young clever resegmentation of the market that we haven't seen before or some new concept even though we\u2019re introducing new solutions all the time but some fundamentally different view of what we\u2019re doing. Our growth opportunity is very tightly related to the quality with which we deliver on the things that we currently do. And so essentially the very first job for our new leadership which by the way wasn\u2019t part of the business, so it's not sort of this completely from the outside sort of a perspective but what we really ask Nadine and team to do was to just intensify the focus on the quality of your operation and the nature of our operation and that\u2019s really stem to stern statement.", "So that applies to all the different lines of business we do, all the different solutions and all the different customers that we serve but what we have really tried to emphasize is we must do high quality work at these very highly elevated volumes that we have achieved over the last couple of years and that everything else follows that, our growth follows that everything is dependent upon that and I have been very happy with the amount of attention that the entire team has given to all of that.", "I mean it's everything, if I was to try to give it to you functionally, the categories are the same as everything that we do. We have got to extract, transform and load data, we have to interpret data, have to then analyze data. We then have to create platforms by which we deliver data and analytic back to our customers. And one of the things on top of that that we have the opportunity to do in the healthcare space particularly it's normalized the data that comes in for different reasons but to normalize so that we have one common set of data definitions and we have achieved that. But it's the all of that, it's not as if there is just one thing where if you pull on the lever all of a sudden it works the way that it's supposed to. It's a very complicated business and it's a very complicated set of steps to get the results that our customers want.", "So it's a big agenda, we have got a good team that\u2019s very actively on that.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "And on the insurance front, you talked about there being some stability and maybe third quarter had a little bit more business than maybe the fourth quarter and that is why the run rate moderated a little bit. How should we think about that business going forward? It looks like it had tweaked down a little bit but should we be looking more at the historical run rates or should we be looking at exit 2013 run rates for that business?", "Mark Anquillare", "I think I will go back to I will highlight one 2013 items that we mentioned this about $12 million item that came into \u201913 it will continue into \u201914 but there won't be any growth. That item was related to a service provider that expired the contract that expired in \u201912. We feel across the insurance operations, very strong. So we feel good. The fourth quarter was a couple of items, primarily inside of I will call it underwriting but the DA insurance business is performing well. It was, you know 4Q is higher than 1Q it's on the right ramp it's on the right trend and I would just highlight you that there is nothing systematic in what you see there. It is over the long term, over the year. I think we will continue to deliver in insurance, I think we\u2019re getting into the right type of conversations with our customers you know walking at the very senior levels having conversations about climate, about their book of business, around profitability. That puts us in a great position to really talk about the suites of solutions that we have to help them really profit.", "So I think we\u2019re making progress.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "And very last question. Any lessons learned from the divestiture that you are carrying forward for future acquisitions?", "Scott Stephenson", "Well I think that what we did there certainly relates to the principles that we run the business by and I would say always have run the business by. We want to be very differentiated with respect to our intellectual property and our proprietary data and analytics and we would like to be facing markets that are inherently healthy, relatively non-cyclical. We\u2019re very focused on competitive advantage and, so essentially our view of who we are as a business has not changed at all.", "What moved was just the underlying market being served by our mortgage business. I think we have talked in the past about the fact that transaction volumes in the mortgage market as recently as 2006 were about four times as large as they are today. And so we just needed to take account of that as we thought about our allocation of capital and put that in the context of all the other ways that we can deploy capital and just drew the conclusion that we had a greater number of opportunities given who we\u2019re in other marketplaces, but fundamentally I'm very impressed with our management team and everything and I think that First American will be a very logical home for the business.", "So now just all of that was a part of our sort of decisioning and so I'm not sure that I could really point to any lessons that we have learned from that. I feel like it's the logical extension of what we've always been doing which is trying to behave strategically and to be very thoughtful about where our capital is deployed.", "Operator", "At this time we have no further questions. I will now return the call over to Mr. Scott Stephenson for closing remarks.", "Scott Stephenson", "Well thank you and thanks to everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company and support, and I just want to say that I hope that all of you can be with us at our upcoming Investor Day on March the 6th, we will be as we have in the past, we will be highlighting several of our solutions. Giving you a chance to really touch them and see how they operate as well as having a live panel of our senior leadership with us to discuss the various parts of our business and so we\u2019re looking forward to that event on March the 6th and hope to see all of you there. And thanks for your time today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

This call is being recorded, at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk\u2019s Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Chief Knowledge Officer, Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.", "Eva Huston", "Thank you, Lisa and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our second quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call this morning are; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark, highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release results have been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until August 30, 2014 on our website and by dial-in.", "And finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to. Scott", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Thank you, Eva and good morning all. Our second quarter revenue growth was good, again driven by very strong performance in our insurance units. We remained focused on our effort to continue to innovate and deliver predictive analytics for our customers, which will in turn lead to solid organic growth and shareholder returns over time.", "As we\u2019ve discussed with you, we consider our organic growth rate to be the single best measure of our vitality as an organization. I believe our assets makes us the best, it has been in my years with the company. And we believe our assets will allow us to deliver the kind of organic growth you\u2019ve come to expect from Verisk.", "I want to share with you a couple of recent highlights, across some of our key themes. A wonderful example on the innovation and investment agenda is the launch of Touchstone 2.0 which is the next version of our next generation cat modeling platform, released earlier this month. As you know we\u2019ve invested in Touchstone and are very pleased with the customer adoption, we\u2019ve seen in the course of 2013 and 2014.", "With this second release, we\u2019re introducing many new capabilities, including support for non-cat risks, such as fire, lightening, explosion and vandalism. Having this information in a single platform, by leveraging other parts of the Verisk insurance solutions group, provide some more comprehensive view of risk, thereby expanding the value to our insurance customers, by giving them a more holistic view of their portfolio.", "Second, we\u2019re focused on the large and long-term opportunity, related to international expansion. We\u2019re in the very early innings with international comprising a small piece of our revenue today. Our units within existing presence outside the U.S are working to expand. We generate revenue outside the U.S today from analytics-related to catastrophe modeling, environmental health and safety, payments and insurance claims. Our other units with solutions and analytics which are applicable or adaptable to international markets are exploring the best ways to enter those markets.", "A recent example of our international efforts is the Risk Symposium, we held in London, in June. We were pleased with the quality of the attendees and the strong interest in our solutions from the insurance industry. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our international efforts will reflect the mix of both organic growth and acquisitions where they make strategic and financial sense.", "M&A remains high on our agenda and our team is actively evaluating opportunities, while we remain focused on our core principle of creating shareholder value through innovation, discipline and execution. We\u2019ve meaningful capacity for additional acquisitions that meet our strategic agenda, both through our significant free cash flow, as well as our borrowing capacity. We also have continued to repurchase our stock, a sign of confidence in our future.", "We continue to work through the SEC approval process, in connection with our announced acquisition of EagleView Technology and still expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter of 2014, likely towards the end of September.", "In the second quarter of 2014, we delivered good overall performance with total organic revenue growth of about 9% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 8%. EBITDA margin in the quarter was about 46%. We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and we remain disciplined in our use of capital.", "In the quarter we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $30 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was about $346 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy as we previously outlined.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning. In the second quarter, total revenue grew 8.5%. For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 10.8% revenue growth. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in insurance. Our Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 14.2% in the second quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in loss quantification and catastrophe modeling solutions.", "Underwriting growth in the quarter was good and claims solutions also contributed. Overall revenue growth was driven by the increased adoption of existing and new solutions as well as a strong quarter for tax-free bonds, although even without that benefit, our Decision Analytics insurance growth was double digits. Because of the cat bond revenue, which is based upon market transaction, I would expect growth to moderate a bit in the coming quarters, but will be strong for the year.", "In addition, we have seen the benefit of new contracts and adoption of new solutions in our repair cost estimating business. These began in 2013 and will come full cycle in the second half of this year.", "In financial services, revenue growth of 11.6% in the quarter was in line with our expectations. Second quarter growth was below our first quarter growth rate due to larger than usual project revenue in the second quarter of 2013. However, overall this is a highly recurring revenue business which offers us a very good visibility. We are confident that the growth outlook at Argus remains strong.", "This includes opportunities related to international expansion, additional penetration of existing customers, and partnering opportunities, in particular related to advertising effectiveness with traditional and new media companies. We remain confident that financial services will grow at least mid-teens in 2014.", "In the healthcare vertical, revenue in the second quarter grew 6.6% led by growth in revenue and quality solutions. We are focused on the Medicare Advantage busy season, which will run through early 2015. We have much better visibility into our customer volumes for this year than we did last year at this time. We\u2019ve improved our operations in support of the business and we have achieved over 50% more records in the second quarter of 2014 than in the second quarter of 2013.", "Pulling the work of the busy season forward and staffing ahead in this way is precisely where we thought we\u2019d be and exactly where we need to be in order to deliver the mid-teens growth for the full year 2014.", "In the specialized markets category, revenue increased 0.8% in second quarter. So good growth in the quarter in environmental health and safety solutions and weather and climate analytics to the commercial market. Growth in government space was offset by the shift of (indiscernible) contract from development to maintenance mode.", "Turning to Risk Assessment for the second quarter, we put revenue growth of 5% indicated the value to our long standing trend customers. Our industry standard insurance programs grew revenue 5% in the quarter, this reflects our 2014 invoices which were effective January 1.", "In addition we saw our contribution to growth from newly adopted solutions such as predictive modeling, electronic reading content and worker\u2019s compensation solutions. We are putting a lot effort into our long standing solutions and building our culture continue our strong position into the future.

This increase was from new sales including those resulting in higher committed volumes.", "EBITDA from continuing operations for the second quarter increased 8% to $194.2 million and our EBITDA margin was 45.9%. The margins in Decision Analytics were 39.4% in second quarter 2014 versus 39.6% in the second quarter of 2013. After the dip in margin, the first quarter 2014 related to increased cost in our healthcare business as well as investments to support our innovation agenda. We are pleased to see the margin close to where we were last year in the second quarter.", "Our preparation for the Verisk Health busy season has included earlier hiring to ensure appropriate staffing levels. So, this is a good result even with the front loading of these expenses. You will recall that as revenue picks up in healthcare business, some portion of these expenses were as well. These variable costs is something you may want to keep in mind, if you look DA margins for the rest of the year.", "In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 56.3% versus 56.0% in the second quarter of 2013. Our margins were advanced in the quarter by revenue growth, good expense management and lower pension cost.", "Our interest expense was down $2.2 million in the second quarter versus the respective period in 2013, due to lower debt balances as a result of repayments made in 2013. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate using our revolver and cash on hand, including the proceeds from the sale of Interthinx to fund the purchase of EagleView Technologies.", " ", "Our reported tax rate was 37.9% for the quarter. Adjusted net income increased 5.1% to $96.9 million in the quarter, adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 7.5%. The average diluted share count was 169.5 million shares in the quarter. On June 30, 2014 our diluted share count was 169.5 million shares.", "In the quarter, we purchased about 0.5 million shares for $30.4 million. At quarter end we had 346 million left under our authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to-date generating annualized IRRs of about 20%. For 2014, we continue to anticipate at a minimum buying shares to offset dilution.", "Turning to our balance sheet as of June 30, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $419.4 million. Total debt both long-term and short-term was about $1.3 billion. Today our incremental debt capacity is about $1 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow.", "Our debt-to-pro forma EBITDA from continuing operations as of June 30 was 1.7 times below our steady-state target. With the acquisition of EagleView Technology using in part cash on hand, interest paid or leverage will be about two times to close the transaction.", "Free cash flow just for two items discussed below grew 4% compared to the prior period to $228.1 million. This represented over 60% of EBITDA from continuing operations in the first six months of 2014.", "As a remainder, we\u2019ve defined free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures to facilitate comparability to the prior period we just did free cash flow for the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013, and for the sale of our mortgage services business this year.", "Cash provided by operating activities, as reported increased $40.1 million. This increase was the result of $20.6 million increase generated by improved profitability of the business, a $5 million decrease in interest paid due to lower debt balances, and a decrease of $46.2 million in taxes. This is partially offset by a $10 million use of cash for working capital, another balance sheet changes and other outflows of $21.2 million.", "Our capital expenditure was 9 or 9% of revenue year-to-date in 2014. We continue to expect about $147 million in CapEx for the full year, a greater use of capitalized software related to new solutions or modestly raised capital intensity of our business when compared to historic levels. We aimed to grow free cash flow at or above the level of our EBITDA growth.", "As you think about your models for the full year 2014, we expect flattish margins for the full year, excluding Interthinx. As we remain focused on our innovation agenda, we are maintaining our longer-term view of margins in the 45% to 47% range. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be about $57 million, fixed asset depreciation, amortization of about $85 million and an effective tax rate between 37% and 38%.", "We aim to keep our share count flat through our share repurchase program. And at current debt levels, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Based upon the strength of our cash flow generation and current debt to cash balances, we anticipate borrowing about $300 million less for the acquisition of EagleView, depending on the timing of close and other events.", "We are expecting to incur $4 million to $5 million of higher legal and professional services fee related to the transaction, most of which will fall in the third quarter. After the close of EagleView transaction, we will update you.", "Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We have a nice mix of growth across multiple verticals, we are executing on our operational plans and we continue to invest with discipline for the future and we continue our strong organic growth.", "I will turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.", "Eva F. Huston", "Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. And given the large of analysts we have covered, we ask you to limit your questions to one and one follow-up, this will give more people an opportunity to ask questions. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "So the first question is just around the cat bond business, I was wondering if you could help us understand the size of that business because clearly it\u2019s been a nice driver for the DA insurance for some time and also if you could maybe help understand, I think you\u2019ve pointed a little bit, but just the one-time impact from just the issuance levels I guess versus the subscription base that moved up?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Sure, so let me first describe a little bit about the way we think of cap on some. Those are very big function inside the opportunity where there is a model that is used for any type of insurance link transaction. We believe that the science is very important there it\u2019s probably the pure sense of the quality of the solution and in a very significant majority of the coupons AIR has own that business, so unfortunately it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to predict, it kind of gets up and down year and year out generally though the trend in insurance-linked transaction in coupons has been growing over time. So we think that is positive trend broadly.", "I think the best way to kind of describe, the impact is, it is not a material part of the cat remodeling business, but it becomes increasingly more important. The overall growth that I wanted to describe inside of Decision Analytics insurance as a whole even without that would have grown about 10%, an excessive 10% actually in the quarter.", "Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then, maybe just around in the financial services piece, you referred to the opportunity in the advertising effectiveness with media companies. I was wondering if you could just help us or elaborate just a little bit more on what exactly that mean?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "This is Scott. Basically through the work that Argus does we have a very comprehensive view of spending patterns by individuals and households. And the world of those who are trying to promote to individuals and households is interested in understanding what the reaction is when there is some form of media campaign. It could be traditional media, it could be new media. Argus data are useful in understanding what the reaction is in terms of consumer spending patterns. That\u2019s the linkage.", "Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Fair enough. I\u2019ll get back in the Q. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Tim\u00a0McHugh with William Blair & Company.", "Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Thank you. First, I guess I want to follow-up on the catastrophe business a little bit. Besides obviously the bond, can you talk about what\u2019s driving the strength there? If you look at the biggest competitor there, they seem to be growing more like mid-single digits. And then, I guess can you touch on, I guess, maybe Touchstone 2.0. I know they\u2019re in the process of trying to roll out their own kind of new technology platform. Just competitively how do you think about that there?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Tim, your second question is actually the answer to your first. A lot of the growth that\u2019s going on now is innovation around the software platform that\u2019s used for not only delivering the cat models, but actually interpreting the cat models into workflows. And this is the change in the cat modeling business. It used to be more about the basic model, which was essentially around a stochastic view of the probability of disasters and their impacts on damage and then the damage impact upon insurance outcomes. Those are the core models.", "The software, which is really \u2013 and this business has become much more software intense, I would say over the last year or two. The software is basically about graving those models and helping our customers to interpret them into their own decisions, whether it\u2019s at the portfolio level or the individual risk level. And the market is responding very positively essentially to all of the things that I just described.", "Our models are seen as being great distinct, very grounded and really good signs. And our software is industry leading at this point. So there\u2019s really been just kind of an across the board very strong reaction by the market. And when I say the market there are lot of different customers segments here, there is global reinsurers, there is insurers, there is reinsurance brokers and all of the segments are responding strongly and positively to what we do.", "Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Does that mean that you\u2019re displacing the competitors there, because they don\u2019t have a new platform out there and are they grabbing new shares? And I guess associated with that do you, I guess if you\u2019re displacing the competitors, what is the risk as they were out their own technology platform that it all stalled some of the pace of growth here, I guess that you\u2019re seeing?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "We are really quite sure that we\u2019re taking share, but it\u2019s also the case that the size and scope of the relationships with our existing customers are also growing. So, both of those are contributing to our growth. And, yes, we expect that RMS will eventually come out with their own solution and this is a \u2013 this will be a perpetual journey for us in terms of always upgrading the value of our solution. That is not really anything different from where the business has been in the past.", "Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James E. Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "I guess I will ask mine up front, but the \u2013 I just want to clarify Mark, with regard to expectations that they would imply that this second half healthcare growth is either in excess of 20% and also at the same time that you\u2019d said you\u2019re expecting team\u2019s growth for Financial Services.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So your math is correct? Correct, yes we are expecting both of those. We are doing the right things with regard to healthcare and position to deliver. And at the same time I just want to emphasize that how strong a business the Argus business is, and I think we feel that we\u2019re making great progress along lot of fronts.", "James E. Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Great, I appreciate the clarification. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.", "Jeffrey P. Meuler \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Follow up first on the healthcare outlook, I think it sounded like part of what gives you confidence is that you are better prepared for the busy season and maybe you\u2019re going to be pulling some revenue forward. Is that the primary sector that gives you the confidence and the re-acceleration in healthcare growth? And asking that from the standpoint that if there is kind of this one-time catch up benefit is the longer term outlook for that business still similarly kind of mid-teens plus.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Let me, let me take your question kind of in the order they were placed. Our confidence about the back half of the year is really a product of two things; one is, we have had the benefit now of the first two quarters and the way that we operated to business and Mark referenced the fact that in the second quarter the quarter we just completed, we retrieved more than 50% of more records than we did in the prior period, second quarter 2013 and so, we have a strong sense of the arc of the volume of the business based upon the fact that we\u2019ve already moved a good number of transactions into the pipeline and as I think most of you know we moved from retrieving the records, coding the records on to the answer that our customers\u2019 needs by way of risk adjustment.", "So we have observed what we \u2013 how we actually operated in the first two quarters that, that\u2019s one part of our confidence and the other is we know where we are with the costumers in terms of what they have access to in terms of volumes to the full year 2014.", "With respect to the longer term and of course our business is made up of many different things we serve the Medicare Advantage space, we serve commercial payers, we have a variety solutions in our view of all those systems that were still a relatively small player in the healthcare data analytics space and essentially our view on that has not changed.", "Jeffrey P. Meuler \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, and then there is talk at the analyst day about Telematics, there was talk in this call about expanding internationally. I believe there was a Telematics international acquisition that got transacted in the quarter. Can you just maybe recap us on what exactly you are looking for in the Telematics space and whether it\u2019s likely to be a build or buy?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes, so we did announce an acquisition it wasn\u2019t in this quarter was actually a while ago, and it is a very, very small acquisition what we acquired was really technology, but our view on Telematics overall is, it is likely that with time our customers are going to be interested in how they rate auto insurance policies and that at some point which is very difficult to determine actually very difficult to predict, data derived via telemetry from vehicles, it can probably play some role in all of that.", "And our first and most important goal here is to remind relevant in terms of auto policies get priced. And so we feel the need to be very familiar with the kind of data that are coming off of the installed devices that you kind of see today, the after-market devices and the mining of data from the OBD ports on the vehicles and but also \u2013 actually there is more interest now in seeing whether we can use our smartphones to also communicate some of the dynamics of the operation of the vehicle. So we\u2019re really interested in it, because we have a relatively large business today in the mechanics of rating a personal auto policy, net commercial auto policy.", "And we see Telematics first and foremost as our ability to stay current with respect to what\u2019s happening there. So some of what we do in Telematics will express itself as sort of new factors, which are incorporated into our rating programs and won\u2019t necessarily emerge as separate revenue line items. But it\u2019s also the case that we think that as we continue to do work in the Telematics space, we\u2019re open to also finding ways to license some of the methodology to others that are also interested in mining telemetry data.", "Jeffrey P. Meuler \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question is going to come from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.", "Andrew C. Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "", "Hi, gentlemen. Mark, I wanted to ask you about some of the events hiring in Verisk Health \u2013 it\u2019s obviously \u2013 is it optimistic side about revenues, I want to talk to you about margins. My question is, has Verisk Health created better efficiencies going into this busy season, because I\u2019m still remembering from last busy season which was fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014, that it was kind of a headcount intensive process for Verisk\u2019s part. I was wondering, as we go into this busy season, while always will require additional heads, will it be efficient?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "", "So, thank you, Andrew. It\u2019s a good question and let me just describe a little bit about the plan that we have and how we\u2019ll roll this out. Because of the \u2013 a little bit kind of seasonal nature of the business, I think \u2013 we are doing right now is we\u2019re getting enough people in place to satisfy what I\u2019ll call the busy season which is the July through to typically into January sometimes in February, Medicare Advantage sweeps.", "What we\u2019ve also done is we kind of work with some partners to handle overflow business. We have that both onshore and offshore to the extent that we need. And the expectation is because, a, we are hired and ramped up significantly more than last year. So that\u2019s why I referenced the additional costs in the quarter that we probably didn\u2019t see in the past. We should be better ready, better equipped to provide: a, higher quality service; b, the productivity should be there.", "It is difficult sometimes to try to manage all these new hires and that kind of self staffing somebody who we have had some tenure with will be better equipped to be able to be efficient, be more productive. We\u2019ve also worked \u2013 we talk about a lot of effectiveness in efficiency, we\u2019ve also worked on internal processes, we have metrics, we have work flow solutions all of those should contribute to higher quality and more effective process in the latter half of the season but the latter half of what will be 2014.", "That's what gives us some of the confidence as we talk about going forward. A lot of these volumes is about interacting with customers, making sure we know how they're going to give to us, when they\u2019re going to give it to us, so we can deliver on our promises and deliver kind of results for them.", "Andrew C. Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "And so there should be some operating leverage as the revenue grows picks up right.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "We clearly incurred some possible in the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year I mean in 2014 to handle the volumes and to satisfy customers. Those are kind of excess costs we would not expect to continue, correct.", "Andrew C. Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify and understand a little better in the Healthcare business. I think the reference was to having collected more than 50%, more volume or increased volume versus the first half of last year. I'm just curious as to how that ultimately translates into revenue. I know there have been some pricing incentives to drive volume. You clearly looking for an acceleration in that business in the back half, but can you just describe the dynamic between record volume and maybe price per and how that informs the revenue growth in the business?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes. Let me, you had a couple questions in there. So just first of all, to clarify the factual statement. What we were communicating is that the number of records that we retrieved in the second quarter of 2014 was more than 50% greater than the number of records we retrieved in the second quarter 2013.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, so q-over-q.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Q-over-q.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Got it. Okay.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "And the way that we get, the way that we get paid is we actually have to work through not only the retrieval of the record, but actually through the coding of the contents which is really onto the interpretation of the content and deliver all of that to the customer. That is the point at which we get paid.", "And so in a sense, you can see what we did in second quarter of 2014 and the growth relative to 2013 is essentially part of the priming of the pump where we will then sort of work through the completion of each of these units as the second half of the year moves that and that\u2019s when we will recognize the revenue. You should not understand a relationship overall between increasing volumes and price point. Last year we referenced the fact that there was one case in particular, where we made that tradeoff, but that\u2019s not fundamentally an explanation for why our volumes are growing.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "", "Okay. So, revenue, all else being equal in that business should more or less track volume growth? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "", "Just one quick clarification for you. Exactly what Scott said, yes, but it\u2019s also an illustration that we\u2019d accelerate the program and we\u2019re trying to move some of these work volumes forward too. So I\u2019d to describe to you a combination.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "So timing in the year versus last year as well?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "That\u2019s well, as volumes. Correct.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then, if you could just elaborate, Mark, a little bit on the nature of the project revenue at Argus. Is that business that comes on and off in some sort of predictable way? In on other words, could there be another quarter in the future where you\u2019d see a big jump in growth for these projects or is it much more episodic than that?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "So a very large percentage of the Argus business is long-term contracts. We recognize it greatly over the year, very high visibility, very high rate of recurring revenue. Around those benchmark studies the beauty of the Argus business is they get very deep and very close to the customers who then need some special projects done.", "In many cases that work or that project work tends to flow a little bit more heavily into the fourth quarter. It represents a smallish fraction, between 10% to 20% of the business and it\u2019s pretty regular, but there is some timing elements as to when. And there was a pretty major project that took place in third quarter of 2013.", "I would tell you that it wasn\u2019t anything we would call out because it is just kind of a part of the business. It happens all the time. So I would tell you we are not concerned by anything, but you see kind of slower growth here in the second quarter around the Argus business. I think we feel good about where we\u2019re going to be.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "One of the nice things going on at Argus is that we\u2019re continuing to find a home in non-domestic markets for our method, which is a real source of encouragement for us.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. So that business could be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarters is what you\u2019re saying?", "Mark V.

Like how should we think about that in relation to \u2013 the trajectory of that business in any given year?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yeah, there is \u2013 there is definitely a relationship, I think your word dependent is a little bit strong because as is true of almost everything that we do in healthcare, part of our opportunity is defined by the fact that we are relative newcomer and so, we haven\u2019t really become the category leader in, I would say, almost anything that we do. And so, part of our opportunity is based upon taking our position inside of these markets.", "But, yes, one of the confidence points for us on Medicare Advantage, the part of our business which faces Medicare Advantage is that on balance we think that the long-term trends are good. If you just look at demography in the United States and you look at the continued relative popularity of Medicare Advantage, we think those are positive factors as it relates to the long-term for our healthcare business.", "Joseph D. Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Okay. And what percentage of healthcare now is Medicare Advantage or the work you do there? And then just adjacent to that. You said your visibility has improved. Can we assume that visibility in that business will always pickup, maybe here going forward? I actually think about that in general.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "So we put out in the past that our Medicare Advantage business is more than 50% our total mix of business in the healthcare space today.", "Joseph D. Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And then, just on the visibility side of things. Should we always expect that midyear it will dramatically increase? I mean just from a seasonal pattern, how should we think about that?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "There definitely is seasonality, particularly as it relates to the Medicare Advantage business. And something that we put out in the past is that overall our total healthcare business is about 40% in the first half, 60% in the second half as a rough general guideline.", "Without question our visibility with respect to the part of the business that is seasonal increases as we move through the year. But part of what we\u2019ve been trying to stress in this call is that because of the substantial ramp in the overall volumes we have in the part of our business which is transactional, especially the Medicare Advantage business, we have been very diligent in the first of half of 2014 in trying to tune operations, anticipate the second half surge, if I can call it that, and to observe on where we need to be.", "So, yes, there is more visibility, but the other part of the equation is preparedness and our team \u2013 I\u2019m very proud of our team. They\u2019ve worked very hard to get prepared for, to deliver against the successful selling that they\u2019ve been doing. And so, we feel good.", "Joseph D. Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.", "Anjaneya Singh \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hello. This is Anj Singh dialing-in for Hamza Mazari. I\u2019m wondering if we can get an update on your joint demand planning discussions with your healthcare customers and what progress you might have made their during the quarter?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve been reporting on throughout here, I mean our ability to as we mentioned a few minutes ago, the ability to retrieve over 50% more volumes in the same time prior period is directly a function of the coordinating that we have been doing with our customers, as well as our strong sense what the volumes will be in the second half, and so that\u2019s all the product of that of the demand planning, I was actually speaking with the head of our healthcare unit yesterday, and she was in touch with one of our important customer, they\u2019re all important to us.", "But one of our large customers and it was just more of the same dialog that we're in with our customers in terms of where they're at, what they need. Believe me, there are a lot of operational metrics that get shared back and forth on a very consistent basis and it is that tied in quality us to them and then to us that really characterizes the way we're going about this business.", "Anjaneya Singh \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got it, and then as we look at your international growth initiative, I\u2019m wondering what are the milestones we should be looking for and as we think about M&A internationally, are there verticals that you prefer to grow organically versus an equivalent basis or will you just be opportunistic and pursue whichever strategy makes more sense?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "It\u2019s definitely, our M&A agenda is definitely not characterized primarily by opportunism, we have got very hard about which verticals we are in, and our first preference always would be to build out from the verticals that we\u2019ve already established, and so the reference earlier the international market is that\u2019s exactly what that\u2019s about, it\u2019s trying to find ways to take our existing capabilities and as they can relevant in other markets.", "It\u2019s just a comment which I know many of you have heard us say before, but I think our methods if you think of it as the algorithms and the methods by which we operate the algorithms, I think they're completely applicable by and large in other markets. The issue is that other economy is don\u2019t have the same tradition of data aggregation that we have in the United States.", "And so, a lot of what actually governs the rate at which we can move out as our ability to begin to cause data sets to flow. We're very open to using our M&A dollars in international markets, but I think you're putting two things together that kind of don't go together in our minds. We will use M&A dollars for international expansion and that\u2019s definitely a part of our thinking, that doesn\u2019t necessarily imply that we were moving into new verticals.", "I think that it\u2019s our view, generally would be that by and large the set of verticals we are serving is a very adequate playing field for us. There are \u2013 there is I don\u2019t want to say too much about it, but there are, there is one vertical which is sort of adjacent to the ones we already in and there may be a linkage there at some point I really wouldn\u2019t want to disclose too much that lower.", "Thinking that right at the moment, but because I would \u2013 I am mentioning that because I wouldn\u2019t want, anybody to be surprised, if it were the case in the future that we did, open up another vertical, but we \u2013 for a long time now we said that we are not looking to sort of add verticals without constrain, we are very thoughtful about what verticals we are in and I think we have a good set of verticals.", "Anjaneya Singh \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Danny Caliendo with Morgan Stanley", "Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi guys, thanks for taking my question, I want to delve into expenses a little bit, they didn\u2019t jump as much quarter-over-quarter this year, as they have in the past especially on the SG&A line, and looking at the Q, and there is some of the salaries actually went down in the quarter there?", "So, maybe if you can just give a little color on your expense control on SG&A? Is it something why may be the bonus is very low, but lower, what is there anything else going on there or maybe your down facto the sales force and focusing more on kind of improving the operational efficiency, let me try to color on the expense curve.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Sure, I think there s I\u2019ll let Mark, answer that but I\u2019ll just say there\u2019s been absolutely no layoffs, we are on the expense then a number of parts of our business, so that\u2019s sort of the furthest thing from the reality of our business. But Mark do you want to take on this SG&A account.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Sure, I think there is couple of things that we continue to do as we tried to fine tune all of our competition plant and in April we give out our Equity words, so one of the things typically affects is obviously you have an increase in equity that that will make the normal increase, I think what you will also find out is, in our program if your age 62 or alter you what make the best and I think we have fewer people in that bracket, or in that kind of category for 2014.", "So I don\u2019t think we have that accelerated best in accelerated best that, would have historically taken place in the April timeframe so that may contribute a little bit to the SG&A item that you referred to. The only other thing that, does come to mind is we think about overall the compensation plans, I think we at Verisk probably have been a little bit more focused in 2014 on variable comp that would be in the form of our short-term cash programs as well as long-term equity programs and probably had a little bit less in the form of salary increases. So if you\u2019re repositioning, although, the overall comp increases were at least as good as in the past, but the way we went about it is probably slightly different this year.", "Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "One more on the CapEx. Historically you were at the low 5%. Now you\u2019re kind of moving more towards this 9% of revenues number and you mentioned that you were spending more on capitalizing software.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Right.", "Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Is there anything one-time in this number or is this just for the next two years or is this 9% number really where you guys are going to be over the next few years? Maybe you\u2019re churning more into a software company than you were in the past or how should we think about the CapEx over time?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "So we don\u2019t think of 9% as the benchmark. We expect that number to come down as we move into 2015 and beyond. But it is also true that in general relative to, let\u2019s say, five years ago, just to pick a reference point, the software intensity of the business have gone up. I referenced, for example, earlier Touchstone, which is a very major movement inside of the whole cat modeling world and that\u2019s just a category of spending, which is tended to be much lower in the past.", "I would also say that because of the desire to bring out these solutions in general across many of our businesses, we find are still spending somewhat more on the internal development of solutions, which we capitalized. There have been a couple of things, which I think have been a little bit more one-time. We\u2019ve basically been consolidating down to data centers and all of that, has required some special attention at the moment in time. And we built a major new facility now in Salt Lake City. In that we\u2019re cycling through that in 2014.", "So, some of those things are going to kind of naturally come down any way. And then, I think as our businesses scale, I think we\u2019ll naturally find that that ratio moderates as well. So 9% is not the benchmark, but it is also the case actually that our business. If you want to be solutions oriented and if you want to be growth oriented, as we do, I think a natural implication is that you become somewhat more capital intense and we have.", "Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, lastly, just a quick one. Going back to the insurance, you mentioned that the transactional revenue and you kind of indicated that the cat modeling were the big part of that, which you result in this particular quarter. I think you said something that would have been 11% without the cat impact. Number one, is that right? And then number two, just so we can kind of be aware of this in future quarters. With this cat transactional revenue, is it cat as the number of deals, maybe the face value on the deals or maybe the number of terms looking at the deals? Maybe a little color on how to think about predicting when a particular quarter might have higher or lower cat.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "", "Yes, that\u2019s a little \u2013 your question sort of ended in sort of a funny place, because prediction is a little bit difficult. And I know you are using shorthand when you\u2019re saying cat, but just to remind you it\u2019s cat bonds. And so, its investors are anticipating that there is something in the market that would allow them to make a return based upon \u2013 in essence betting on the frequency and the depth of catastrophe activity, but we\u2019re talking about the investing in the bonds.", "And the bond volumes tend to be a functional of a couple of things. One is, probably some very general sense of the intensity of catastrophe activity in the economy globally, but also a sense of different ways that you can lay off catastrophe risks. So how active is the reinsurance market with respect to ensuring against cat risk et cetera. So there\u2019s a number of factors that are actually in there. The market over time has tended to grow, but it also has tended to cycle around a little bit. Mark, I don\u2019t really have a predictive metric in mind. I don\u2019t know if you do.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "", "No. I just will reiterate what I said, Danny. The growth in DA insurance is greater than 10% excluding the cat bonds and the way those cat bonds are priced to be exact. It\u2019s about the size of the deal and obviously that the number of deals that happen.", "Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess my question was more about how the revenue hit, not necessarily the size of the cat bond market, but how did revenue actually hit your insurance plan? So I guess your answer to that is that if we\u2019re looking on cat bond issuance in a particular quarter, we would want to focus on the number of deals and the size of deals and then it could be taken by 3% impact to growth into this year versus the last quarter.", "Eva F. Huston", "Hey, Danny, it\u2019s Eva. Thank you very much. I think we got four questions in the set. So we\u2019re going to move on.", "Danny Caliendo \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks.", "Eva F. Huston", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks for the confidence around healthcare and talking about the increase you pulled for. It do sounds like it\u2019s more than 50% of your business. Can you just talk about the remaining parts of your business in healthcare, the kind of visibility you have there? And how you feel about that going to the third quarter? Anything you can give us to kind of help us feel more confident in that backend growth rate would be helpful. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "", "So I think most folks know that \u2013 so as we\u2019ve talking about Medicare Advantage that\u2019s really about our RQID division. We have two others. One is enterprise analytics and the other is payment accuracy. Payment accuracy is about diligence and claims to get fraud, waste, and abuse out of them and enterprise analytics is essentially about risk adjusting and including applications of risk adjusting into categories like population health management.", "So those other businesses are very important in the mix of what it is that we do. And we\u2019re looking for really growth across the board in the business. I would say that kind of recently payment accuracy has had some nice win in the sales in terms of growth. Payment accuracy tends to have more of a transactional nature to it. Essentially our revenue is related to the amount of money that we thrift for our customers. Enterprise analytics tends to be very subscription oriented.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll give the same. But are those divisions with any healthcare growing at sort of a divisional average in the second quarter or was all the growth driven by Medicare Advantage?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "So I\u2019m not going to get into specifics, but they\u2019re growing. Yes.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. Obviously those are a little more transactional basis. Is Analytics more subscription?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Yes, that\u2019s what I said.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Right. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.", "Jeffrey M. Silber \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "", "Thanks so much. Just wanted to go back to the EBC transaction. I think initially you had expected the deal to close in July than mid-Q3 now. It\u2019s the end of 3Q. Are there any specific reasons for the delay?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "It\u2019s the government\u2019s process. I mean, we\u2019re answering questions and we respect our government and they\u2019re going to run their process the way they\u2019re going to run it.", "Jeffrey M. Silber \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Okay. And it\u2019s just a follow-up. Just going back to some, I guess the front loading cost in Verisk Health, would that been in the cost of services line as opposed to the SG&A line?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes.", "Jeffrey M. Silber \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Okay. Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Andre Benjamin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "", "Hi. Good morning. First, I want to know understanding that a lot of the business is subscription base. I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing any changes to demand trends in Argus\u2019 services from a push by some of the banks to get more aggressive lending to some less optimal or \u201csubprime lenders\u201d as the recovery matures.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "No, I don\u2019t see that as a factor.", "Andre Benjamin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay and on the healthcare side I am wondering in terms of how us think about the size of the addressable market and growth and I know these things don\u2019t change that much quarter-to-quarter, but if you have any thoughts on how those sides in the market is relative to the $4 billion that you discussed at the Analyst Day, how the three markets are growing, and are there any key capabilities that come up in your conversation with clients that you think will help you better attack those buckets relative to what you are capable of today.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Well, yeah so our view of the opportunity really have not change as kind of implied in your question. Healthcare continues to be a very large part of the American economy and in general, it is an environment that is characterized by I would say an increasing interest in the use of data analytics to make decisions. Supported in, I would say in a background kind of a way by our government\u2019s seeming interest in pulling more data analytics and to the part of the cost tax of government is responsible for and by making data sets from CMS a little bit more available.", "So, that kind of the overall sense of the market is that it remains as the opportunists as it has one of the big sort of issues on the horizon is, will the providers become more risk bearing and there is a lot more talk about that and then there is actually progress to-date if not that there has been none and there are more accountable care organizations than they are used to be, but when you look at the fraction of the risk which has been warned by the providers it still relatively low.", "Another movement in the space that you got the rise of the exchanges there are the public exchangers there are also the private exchanges and we\u2019ve actually had some nice progress in terms of becoming the analytic inside of some of the exchangers. We actually see the exchanges as another customer segment in the same way that commercial payers or a customer segment in the way that state medicates our customer segment etc.", "So you have those kinds of developments in the market. But the overall story is the effective reform is to have more people be insured and since the majority of our business is with insurers today on balance that is a relatively positive trend.", "Andre Benjamin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thanks.", "Eva F. Huston", "Operator, last question please.", "Operator", "Our last question will come from the line of David\u00a0Togut with Evercore.", "David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a quick final question if I would, Scott and Mark. I\u2019m trying to piece together your comments, Mark, that you saw over 50% growth and records retrieved in the RQI business, and that you\u2019re expecting 20% plus growth in healthcare in the back half. Can you sort of correlate records retrieved with revenue growth? It doesn\u2019t really seem to be one-to-one. Is there is a ratio we should be thinking of?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Well, one thing you should bear in mind. I know Mark is going to jump in at a slightly more technical level, but bear in mind that the record retrieval that we\u2019re talking about relates to only part of our business. So that characterization of a much greater rate of record retrieval is very accurate and augurs for growth in the third and the fourth quarter, but you can\u2019t do it one-for-one in terms of the growth of our overall healthcare business because those records and that retrieval relates to the part of our business, which is Medicare Advantage, which is we said is greater than 50%, but it\u2019s well shy of 100% of our whole mix. So, you can\u2019t complete those two.", "Mark V. Anquillare", "And, David, I\u2019ll just kind of reiterate what I was trying to describe earlier in terms of follow-on. I think we feel good about the increased volumes. I think it\u2019s indicative of a combination of: a, our customers and working with our customers to get things sooner and also it\u2019s partially indicative of the fact that we do had greater volumes apples-to-apples compared to last year. So, I can\u2019t tell you there is a direct correlation to revenue there, but it\u2019s certainly a partial correlation. And I think it\u2019s a set of good example set aside of several things that we\u2019re doing to make sure that we deliver on the results in the second half.", "David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Is Medicare Advantage all of the RQI business?", "Mark V. Anquillare", "Not all of it, but most of it.", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Yes, yes.", "David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners", "So in other words the RQI business should growth well in excess of 20% in the back half?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "Not sure we said that, David.", "David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay. That\u2019s just my interpretation. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further questions. [Presenters] (ph), do you have any closing remarks?", "Scott G. Stephenson", "It\u2019s Scott here and I just would like to thank everybody for joining us for this earning call and for your continued interest in our company. I know that Eva and team will be following up with several of you and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.", "Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer", "Thank you, Shannon, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "All numbers we discussed today, unless otherwise stated, will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx. Interthinx is shown in discontinued operations reflecting the sale of the business in March 2014. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K, which we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until March 26, 2015, on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.", "Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Eva, and good morning, everyone.", "We're very pleased with the results we reported last night with outstanding revenue growth and strong operating discipline. In the fourth quarter, we delivered excellent results with total revenue growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 18%. Full year revenue and diluted adjusted EPS both grew about 9%.", "Excluding the costs associated with the FTC review of the EVT acquisition and the fourth quarter risk assessment reorganization costs that Mark will discuss in more detail, our diluted adjusted EPS growth in the quarter was 22%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth for the full year was 9.4%, Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin of 46.2% in the quarter and 46% for the full year.", "Adjusting for FTC-related costs and Decision Analytics and the reorganization and risk assessment, full year EBITDA margins were 46.6%. This is consistent with our expectations and previous comments that we would maintain margins at about the same level as 2013, while also investing in our business. As you know, in December, we concluded our efforts to acquire EVT following the vote by the FTC to challenge the transaction. We worked hard to come to a mutually agreeable solution with the FTC, but no agreement could be reached that was in the best interest of our shareholders.", "While we were disappointed in the FTC's decision, we are committed to remote sensing and imagery analytics and intend to be the leader in these areas. For competitive reasons, we'll be measured today in our comments regarding our go-forward strategy. The solutions we have and will create over time will be based on a multi-tier, multi-spectral set of images. We are doing this today with satellites in our Verisk Climate division and with non-satellite images at Xactware. In fact, Xactware recently announced that Property InSight is now available for all residential, commercial and agricultural structures in the United States.", "The Property InSight data bundle includes 3D property models, roof exterior and property measurements and property risk factors, among other critical data points, for professionals who work with properties. We also announced the launch of the Xactware Remote Sensing Lab, a collaborative industry group dedicated to developing remote sensing technologies specific to the property industry.", "The Lab is a natural extension of Verisk's long history of partnering with customers on new technology and applications. Participants in the Lab include experts in remote-sensing, computer vision, geospatial intelligence and analysis, computer science, engineering and geology.", "We expect to pursue our strategy through balanced investments, synchronized with revenue growth, and will remain within our typical margin expectations. As we had accumulated cash in anticipation of EVT transaction, we determined that a return of capital to our shareholders in the form of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase was appropriate.", "This was in addition to the $90 million in the fourth quarter and $275 million for the full year we spent repurchasing shares in the open market. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was $190 million. We continue to feel confident in our long-term opportunities to grow shareholder value, and the accelerated share repurchase is evidence of that confidence.", "In addition to returning capital to our shareholders, we remain active in looking at M&A opportunities. We continue to focus on assets with a strong strategic fit, and as we've been discussing with you, we are interested in using acquisitions to support our international expansion efforts. We remain interested in both our existing verticals as well as potentially other global verticals that can leverage our existing intellectual property.", "In the fourth quarter, we made two small acquisitions, both of which expanded our global footprint. One, DART, is in financial services and is now part of Argus. The other, Maplecroft, is in the area of country and political risk and an important complement to our existing supply chain initiatives.", "DART is a leading provider of benchmarking and advisory solutions to financial services institutions in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific markets. Argus and DART will serve financial institutions in lending and payment product optimization.", "Maplecroft, which is based in the U.K., uses a proprietary data aggregation and analytical approach enabling its customers to assess, monitor and forecast a growing range of worldwide risks, including geopolitical and societal risks, many down to the local site level. Maplecroft's unique solutions are used by multinational companies, financial institutions, governments and NGOs. Maplecroft's research data and platforms complement our world-class capability in natural catastrophe and extreme weather impact assessment in order to form a comprehensive set of analytic solutions. The combination will enable organizations to make informed risk-adjusted decisions for their assets, operations and supply chains.", "With the addition of Maplecroft, we are establishing ourselves as a leading provider of value chain optimization tools, providing comprehensive quantitative risk analytics and platforms by which our customers can visualize, quantify, mitigate and manage their risks. We have rebranded the company Verisk Maplecroft to reflect our growing international strategy. You'll have a chance to see Maplecroft's solutions at our Investor Day next week on March 5 in New York City.", "As we look back over the past two years, we've been able to deliver very good results in the context of a temporary step-up in our investments and a sizable expansion of our healthcare business. Both our organic revenue growth and our operating profitability continue to be sector leading, and we remain committed to a prudent mix of M&A and share repurchases over time to complement and enhance our core businesses. This combination positions us very well to deliver the kinds of shareholder returns over the next several years that we expect of ourselves and that you expect of us.", "So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover the financials in more detail.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Scott.", "For the fourth quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in the future. Revenue grew 11.6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and 9.5% for the fiscal year 2014. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, revenue grew 11.4% for the fourth quarter and 9.4% for the fiscal year 2014. The strong organic growth reflects the health of our business and the value we deliver to our customers.", "Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 15.2% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 15% on an organic basis. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in financial services, healthcare and insurance. For the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 12.1% as reported and organically. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 12.3% for the fourth quarter of 2014. Underwriting solutions led the growth, followed by catastrophe modeling and loss quantification solutions. Insurance fraud claims solutions also contributed to the growth. Overall, growth was driven by the increased adoption of existing and new solutions and annual increases in invoices.", "Touchstone, our next-generation catastrophe modeling platform, continued to drive growth, as did our GIS risk platform and property replacement cost underwriting solutions.", "In the Financial Services category, revenue grew 25.2% in the fourth quarter 2014. The revenue increase was driven by demand of our analytic solutions and services. As you know, we sometimes see project revenue in the fourth quarter from our clients as they look to fully utilize their budgets, and again saw that in 2014. For the full year, Financial Services revenue grew 19.3%.", "In the healthcare vertical, revenue in the fourth quarter grew 21.8%, all organic, with growth across all divisions led by Payment Accuracy Solutions. For the fiscal year 2014, revenue from healthcare grew 16.2% at the higher end of the direction we gave you for mid-teens growth. This is a strong outcome in the area of our business that is more transactional than the rest of Verisk.", "As we look ahead to 2015, we want you to understand a change in one part of the revenue in the Medicare Advantage area of our RQI business at Verisk Health. We recently adjusted some of our contract language at Verisk Health to accommodate health plans that want to include prospective health assessment costs in their medical loss ratios.", "We prefer changing the contract language instead of becoming a licensed medical provider. There is no impact to our bottom line as we've always netted out these revenues and expenses. The only result is a change in less pass-through revenue in 2015 than in prior years.", "Overall, we expect to see good growth for the full year versus comparable 2014 revenue number of $279.5 million. Similar to 2014, revenue growth will be somewhat weighted to the latter part of the year, and while we don't breakout profitability of Verisk Health, we expect EBIT to grow faster than revenue in 2015 as we continue with our program of operational improvements.", "In specialized markets category, revenue declined 0.5% in the fourth quarter 2014 and 0.8% for the full year. Good growth in Weather and Climate Analytics and Environmental Health and Safety Solution was more than offset by lower activity related to government customers. Verisk Climate continues to provide important analytic content for our insurance customers and our supply chain related initiatives. The specialized category will return to growth in 2015 both as reported and organically.", "Turning to Risk Assessment, for the fourth quarter, we reported revenue growth of 5.5% indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment was due, in part, to 5.1% revenue growth of our industry-standard insurance programs resulting primarily from growth in 2014 invoices effective January 1.", "Property-specific rating and underwriting revenue increased 6.8% in the fourth quarter. Growth was a result of new sales with higher committed volumes. For the full year, Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.2% driven by 5.1% of growth in industry-standard programs and 5.7% of specific rating underwriting category.", "For the fourth quarter 2014, EBITDA grew 13.4% to $214.6 million with an EBITDA margin of 46.2%. For the fiscal year 2014, EBITDA grew 7.8% to $803 million with an EBITDA margin of 46%. Excluding professional fees related to the FTC of $6.9 million for the full year 2014, including $1.7 million in the fourth quarter as well as risk assessment reorganization costs of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter 2014, EBITDA margin was 46.6% for the fiscal year 2014.", "The fourth quarter 2014 EBITDA margin for Decision Analytics increased 41.1% from 38.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Excluding the FTC-related costs, full year Decision Analytics EBITDA margin was 40.2%.", "Over the past year, we've been working to position our core insurance business for sustained growth and innovation into the future. In the fourth quarter, we offered voluntary resignation packages to a group of our long-tenured employees to honor their solid contributions to the business. The risk assessment reorganization was a talent realignment rather than simply a cost reduction exercise. We intend to reinvest the savings from those taking these packages back into our core business in the areas like product strategy, advanced analytics, technology platform and customer engagements, which are crucial for sustained innovation.", "The fourth quarter 2014 EBITDA margin Risk Assessment decreased 55.4% from 57% in fourth quarter of 2013.

Under the ASR program, we received an aggregate initial delivery of approximately 6.4 million shares, which represented an estimated 80% of the ASR at the then current prices. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR were based on a discount from the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock over the course of the program, which will be run up to six months or conclude earlier at the broker's option. At final settlement, we expect to receive additional shares of our stock.", "In the fourth quarter, we also repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares for $90.5 million prior to the announcement of the ASR. For those shares purchased in the quarter, the average price we paid was $62.54. At December 31, 2014, the company had about $190 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

We expect CapEx of about $115 million up modestly from 2014.", "Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing very well. We are seeing growth from multiple verticals and we are executing on our operational plans.", "With that, let me turn it back over to you for comment before Q&A.", "Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer", "Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions.", "And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair and Company. Your line is now open.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks. I guess the first question just on the margins, and I guess as we think towards next year, if I adjust for the new revenue presentation for healthcare I guess, my quick math, which could be wrong, tells me that's about a 90 basis point boost to the margin just because that's pass-through revenue. And then there's another 60 basis points from stripping out the professional fees in restructuring. So between those two that puts you above the 45% to 47% range, I guess. You've talked about being within. Is that still the range, then, that we should we think about next year, or are there factors offsetting it that the underlying margins would be coming down?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, Tim, thanks for the question. I think your math is good. To the extent you think about the FTC costs, which we do agree are onetime, and the nature of the change in accounting, the 90 bps is about right in both cases.", "I'll continue to just to highlight that we have a high degree of good feelings about the business into 2015, especially around margin performance. We think that we have scale in all of those businesses. What we continue to, obviously, balance is the investment in the business to make sure that we grow into the future. So our view is, we're feeling very positive about where margins should be anticipated in 2015, moderated by what I would say is some overlap in investment.", "The other thing I'll highlight to the team, I think we tried to bring it out inside of the conversation, the script is that the iPass reorganization, albeit a $4.8 million number, is probably something that will come back into the P&L in 2015. We are looking to redeploy those resources.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And the healthcare comment was \u2013 I guess, I wasn't clear what you, from a revenue growth perspective on, I guess, the new revenue presentation. Are you still looking for double-digit growth or mid-teens growth like you were talking about last year in that business or, I guess, on an underlying basis, how are you thinking about the outlook there?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We feel good about the business. The growth in 2014 was broadly based across many different solution sets. We expect the growth in 2015 to be broadly based across several solution sets.", "One of the metrics that, among several, but one that some folks follow is the rate of growth in the Medicare Advantage population. It's been the case, and we expect it will continue to be the case, that in that segment of what we do, we would grow faster than the underlying market, which is actually true of a lot of what Verisk does across our many solution sets. So we feel very good about our growth into 2015.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And we would take that growth and grow it off of the $279.5 million that we were describing throughout the day.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, guys. So just to follow up on the healthcare, like thinking longer term, one of your competitors obviously just went public and they've thrown out long-term targets of 20%-plus with some mid-30%s margins and so forth. I was just curious if you guys could provide us any color. I know anecdotally you guys are very positive on the space, but just trying to get a sense of how we should think about this over the next, call it, five years.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, our mix is by degrees different from theirs. And so we're certainly interested in an (24:14) company with whom we compete in some categories. But our reference point is really us and the solutions that we've got and the customers that we're serving.", "And this is one of the places inside of Verisk where, as we've said in the past, we've actually got secular tailwinds in the form of just kind of the underlying demand in the market, and it causes us to feel good about where we sit. We have strengthened the business operationally and expect to continue to do that. So it's a positive outlook for us inside of the healthcare space.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then just on your M&A pipeline, so for a couple of years, I guess, we've heard you talk about a very active M&A pipeline and maybe the last year, the pending EVT deals that have held you guys back. But what's the roadblock or what's the delay in terms of executing some of these deals that you have in your pipeline?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, maybe other than sort of the obvious one about the FTC process last year. I wouldn't call it a road block, but I would describe us as a very thoughtful acquirer. There are any number of transactions that we could have closed over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months, some of which you actually would have heard about if you observed the space around us where, just based upon our sense of valuation versus the sellers' ambitions, we were definitely positioned to buy businesses, but for valuation considerations chose not to. So we don't actually feel constrained and are leaning very heavily into the M&A agenda.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Congrats on the quarter.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hi. I was wondering, could we dig a little deeper as to why the change in the accounting methodology and what opportunities it either opens or changes from a demand perspective in the healthcare business?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So just to go back to fundamentally why we're making this change, our customers in the context of the Accountable (sic) [Affordable] Care Act, are being measured and managed on their medical loss ratios. And they need to make sure that they don't fall below levels that the government has identified as the benchmark.", "So what they're interested to do is to have as many costs reflected in the expense line, which is the numerator of the calculation. One of those expenses that our customers would like to have in that numerator is the cost of prospective health assessments, and that's the product line that Mark was describing.", "In order for us to provide the service and book the gross revenue, we would have to have \u2013 we would have to be treated as if we were a provider. We would have to have a provider ID. We're not interested in being that. We're not interested in having the liability associated with being a provider.", "So all we've done is we've said that the pass-through revenue associated with that service, we're just not going to book as revenue anymore. Otherwise, we're still providing the service just as much as we did before. We're simply changing the way that we account for it, and that is the only change. And it really has zero interaction with our business going forward.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Got it. That's very helpful. And then on the insurance business, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing from an underlining demand trends. I know that there's been no correlation between premium movements. But how do you feel about that, and how long does it take, you think, to create that imagery business as opposed to the acquisition? Thanks.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Okay. So let me \u2013 two very different questions, both good questions. So the insurance market has its ebbs and its flows. We're in a place right now where it certainly is not growing at high rates. It cycles around a little bit, but as we've often described, our opportunity is really based on the amount of value that we can create for our customers, the amount of innovation we can put into existing and new solutions.", "And so our situation is very similar to what it has always been, which is we love the insurance market and our customers. It's a steady market, which is of course what we all look to insurance for, and our performance is going to be a function of the innovation and value that we can bring.", "On the Aerial Imagery front, I just really want to emphasize two things that I hope are clear, but just to make sure. The first one is we've got fully dimensioned analytics already; the analytics are already built. And the second is that we have a set of images that cover the entire country. So we're all dressed up and ready to go.", "The ongoing issue with respect to imagery is that we would like to see the quality of the images improved and, in fact, that was part of the thought process around EVT was that we would start with their library but improve it. We're now discussing multiple additional ways that we could go about doing that, and we will inform you when we have chosen which of those paths we're going to go down. But we feel very good about where we sit, and we feel very bullish about the business going forward.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line in now open.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So in healthcare, just conceptually, how should we think about the trajectory of healthcare growth rates in 2015 given seasonality but also given the fact that the comps are easier in the first half of the year?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Toni, so I just want to try to catch the question. Very similar to what we've talked in the past, from a seasonal perspective, the suites (30:32) regarding Medicare Advantage and the work that we do with RQI is second-half weighted. So we have talked about 60% at the end of the second half, 40% in the first. And I think you'll see that same type of ramp as we progress through the year.", "If your question is a little broader kind of to the one we had earlier, I think I'll kind of reinforce Scott's position. I think we're feeling good about the business as a whole. I think we're feeling good about healthcare. And one of the things I think you probably noted in the way we described the growth, RQI, which is more transactional, has been strong but so is the payment accuracy side of the business which is a fundamental fraud fighting kind of expertise that we have and we felt good about that.", "Final element or final component from the healthcare perspective, population management is the rage right now. Everyone's trying to find ways to better consume healthcare and probably get better outcomes for less cost. And that trend, that interest, I think will continue to spur our Enterprise Analytics business. So across the board, I think we look forward to 2015.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Maybe just to amplify a little bit on that point. There are a couple of sort of emerging customer sets in the healthcare world. One would be the accountable care organizations and integrated delivery networks and their ilk and the other would be the exchanges both public and private. And we feel very good about the territory we've been able to claim in both of those categories, which is a source of encouragement for us on where we're headed.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, terrific. And then I've been reading a lot about the increasing popularity of cat bond lite transactions. Can you just talk about how you expect that that trend may impact your business if at all? Thanks.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I appreciate the qualifier on your question because it's just important to bear in mind that cat bonds are one of many ways that catastrophe risk gets managed and transferred. And in fact, it's one of the lesser ways, so it's identifiable because there are discreet transactions and we do very well on the category. In 2014, we had about 80% of all those transactions, but I just encourage you to keep it in context.", "Overall, it is a small part, a very small part, of the revenue associated with what we do in catastrophe modeling. So that said, cat bonds lite, you're still going to need a calculation agent that's going to stand as a third party to render a dispassionate and technically deep view of what's going on. And so if that was to expand that market overall a little bit, that would be great. We expect to still be highly competitive with respect to what's going on there.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Terrific. Great quarter. Thanks.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. I want to talk a little bit about the Risk Assessment business, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. I remember third quarter commentary about some shift in annualizing or annualize contracts with reinsurance customers. It seems like somehow we've overcome that. So could you talk about how we accelerated in the fourth quarter, and given that 2015 invoices are out now, will the fourth quarter trajectory foray continue into 2015?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Andrew. Let me take that. This is Mark. First of all, I think we had a strong year from Risk Assessment. I think we have fundamentals in the businesses are as strong as ever and the position we have is strong as ever. A couple things to highlight if I think about the fourth quarter. First of all, some of our content is actually licensed through vendors, and that revenue is strong. It's been a component of a license and there's some royalties. So we saw some pickup there, so that's good news and hopefully that will continue into 2015.", "And I think I've highlighted some other elements of Risk Assessment. We've talked about Risk Analyzer, which is our predicted modeling. We've moved from very much focused on personal auto but into homeowners as well as into the commercial line space and that has been up \u2013 the uptake there has been very strong and very good. We've had some good news around what is our electronic rating content. That's the way we take our loss cost and our rules and embed it deeply into our customers' workflows. And finally even Workers' Comp, which we haven't talked a lot about, had some good legs in the quarter and we think will continue. So those are the features of the fourth quarter, which I think will bode well into 2015.", "And I think to answer the second part of your question, at this point you referenced about invoices; you're right there out. And I think we've done what we've consistently tried to do. We've tried to deliver value to our customers, reflect that in the invoices. At this point in time, though, you have to remember that more than 50% of the way we're contracted with customers, it really is about longer-term contracts now that they're committed to, they're multiple year. So it's not as much annual recalculations. And I think we're going to see a consistent growth reflecting the value we provide.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'll just add those multi-year contracts Mark was referencing, they always increase year \u2013 they always carry year-over-year price escalators.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Perfect. Thanks, guys.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore. Your line is open.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. You saw a very nice acceleration in organic revenue growth in the quarter to 11% from what had really been trend line organic growth in the high single digits over the last couple years or so. So my question really is, are the drivers of the higher growth rate more specific to the fourth quarter, or are you generally seeing an improving demand trend that might support more of a low double-digit-type organic growth rate going forward?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, of course, what we do is extremely broadly based; we're in multiple verticals, et cetera. So I don't think there's one answer really to your question. I would say that the demand factors across the vertical markets that we serve are, at least, as strong as they have been. So if you think of that as foundational, I would say at least as strong as they have been in the recent and intermediate past.", "And as is always the case with our company, in 2014, including in the fourth quarter, we found ways based upon value to grow our business at a rate which was greater than that of our customers and the underlying markets and we believe that that dynamic will continue to apply in 2015. And we have definitely been doing a lot of investing into the business to try to create new solutions, to try to re-platform existing solutions. All of these things are pro-growth, and we are definitely focused on the organic growth of our business.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "I appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up, you saw a nice acceleration in growth in financial services in the quarter; I think Mark called out some project-specific work behind that. But are there other factors that might support a more sustained higher growth like what we saw in the fourth quarter?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So thanks for the question. I think what we've seen inside of the financial services category is really the fundamentals of the business where we've been able to actually take that product and extend it internationally has helped. And that's progress, and I think that's something that we'll continue to see in 2015.", "The other thing that is a little bit more project work, I don't want to suggest that's a big, big number, but that is a typical kind of bit of a surge at year end where people and customers have some dollars to spend and they try to get their money's worth at year end. So I wouldn't necessarily annualize that base. But the underlying fundamentals internationally is very good. And the other thing that I will highlight is the world of marketing and advertising effectiveness, which is a way to go about helping advertisers understand how good and how effective their advertising is based upon the consumer and the spend is a very big category for us, and that continues to grow nicely and will have legs into 2015.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)", "Understood. Thanks so much.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So earlier in the call, you had referenced growth in Medicare Advantage. I'm just trying to balance that with some forecasts that we've seen indicate that growth may inflect negative in the coming years. Just wondering how you think about the impact from that. Is there any risk to the healthcare category's growth, or is it safe to say that demand for the analytics within that space should easily offset that?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We don't see kind of what you're hypothesizing there. We don't actually see that. The long-term factor inside of Medicare Advantage is an aging population and a preference for the Medicare Advantage product. So I'm not quite sure whose projection you're referencing. First, the most recent look at growth in the enroll populations was actually very strong, high single-digits. So between that and our own work, to make what we do valuable for our customers, we feel good about the environment.", "Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Got it. Yeah, it's the CMS Office of the Actuary that I believe has those forecasts a little bit further out showing that the growth there dips. But I guess moving onto my next question. I'm wondering if you can discuss the head count reductions in Decision Analytics during the fourth quarter. Can you tell us which category this was attributable to? Is there more room for efficiency there and, perhaps, how you think about your SG&A going forward in light of it being remarkably flat the past few years.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So first of all, just to make sure you're clear, the head count reduction was in Risk Assessment, not Decision Analytics. And basically it was, we took the opportunity on a, really, on a one-time basis to reset the talent inside of that business. As Mark said, we're trying to make the unit more analytic and more capable of the kind of high-value growth that we're looking for.", "So it really was a moment in time readjustment, and this is inside of what is really the oldest part of Verisk ISO. And so we just made our assessment. Clearly, what we did has made us stronger and will continue to make us stronger into the future. So we feel very, very good about it. The transition was quite smooth and in line with what we expected. So, Mark, do you want to talk about SG&A at all?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, and I believe your question there was on a broader context, the SG&A category throughout the corporation. I think we have a constant goal to try to be continuously improving those operations, and inside the SG&A category, I think we've been pretty successful there.", "Couple things that I'll highlight. We've done some data center consolidation. We continue to see benefits from that. I'm not sure that those benefits will increase as much into 2015. The other thing that helped us in 2014 was pension, and the pension assets performed extremely well. So there was good news in a reduction to the pension cost in 2014. As we roll into 2015, the mortality tables have changed, offsetting what was good news inside of the pension asset returns. So the pension will actually cost us more into 2015. I think those couple things are more or less offsetting. I would just see some gradual increase in SG&A maybe up a little from what you've seen in 2014.", "Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from SIG. Your line is open.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Great way to end the year, guys. I had a couple of questions, so I guess I'll ask them upfront. So, Mark, you had mentioned project-related work in financial service. I think we've become more accustomed to seeing that in insurance DA. Anything to call out there? And then the other one is, Scott, relative to DART and Maplecroft, as we're trying to figure out the contribution for 2015, I realize you gave an organic for the fourth quarter. Did those deals close early or late in the quarter so we can try and annualize those? Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Why don't you take the first question, Mark, and I'll take the second.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So from a project-related work, the things that typically come to mind both in our cat modeling category and what we refer to as the loss quantification, which is Xactware, sometimes there's work that's done on behalf of a customer to more deeply integrate the models into their environments. Obviously, cat bonds is the other element. Although these are big, sometimes they do flux into fourth quarter. I don't think there was anything to call out in the fourth quarter inside the insurance category. It was probably a little bit more than other quarters, but nothing unusual.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And to your question, DART closed in November and Maplecroft closed in December.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning. Two questions, one on energy, one on healthcare. First on energy, I know you said you're going to be measured in your comments, but I know at that time you bought EagleView, you were pretty clear you thought they were a very strong competitor. Now they're going to remain a competitor. So I was just wondering how we should think about how you're thinking about competing, how aggressively you're willing to spend to become a leader, and whether we should characterize imagery as remaining at the top of your priority list that you're going to pursue aggressively or if that's kind of overstating its importance relative to the whole business?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Imagery is a high priority for us, and we believe that imagery will play a number of roles inside of Verisk. So the first order role is the existing product set, which is using images in the process of responding to property claims. The next most important use will be as it relates to a higher degree of automation in the underwriting process, where imagery will play a role in that.", "And beyond that, we think that the interpretation of images, whether they're taken from 50 miles above the Earth or a couple thousand feet above the Earth or a couple hundred feet above the Earth from a drone, all of those need to be brought together into a kind of one unified way of dealing with imagery so that you get to the best solution at the lowest cost. EagleView plays at one of those levels today, primarily. We intend to play at all of those levels. That is part of what we think is important here. And the other part is that just like with most of what we do, there's also a very important requirement to distinguish based on analytics and the workflow by which the analyzed output gets into the customers' own process.", "We intend to be doing all of those things in order to make it happen for our customers. And so we believe the category is important. We believe that we will bring a lot of strength to this, and as I said, the only part of it that might register as a question is where will the images come from? Again, just want to underline, we already have the images for the entire country and the objective for us is to get, yet, more precise images. And we feel very confident that we are able to do that and we are really sorting among the options for doing that right now.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And the second question was on RQI. I was just wondering if you could talk about your level of penetration of the client base and the updated thoughts on the size of the market. I know you've got an Analyst Day coming up, so you may be looking to save it for then. And specifically, I was interested in how many of the country's biggest clients that have the large data and analytics firms are currently clients?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So we feel very good about the customer list. We have many of the name brand commercial carriers among customers for what it is that we do. Our sense is that we are a share leader in the business. It's also clear to us, however, that we don't work with everyone and we don't have all of the available business from those with whom we do work.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Bill.", "William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So I've got a question for you about what impact, if any, you think the severe weather in the Northeast potentially has on some different parts of your business, it seems like, near term, potentially you have some benefit from Xactware and XactContents from a transaction piece there. But could it also be impacting cat modeling demand and possibly even premium growth for the coming years?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So I think you answered your own question. I mean...", "William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Does that make sense though?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, definitely. Those are the places where our business actually responds to events. Now that said, in the course of the year, there are lots of natural events, natural \u2013 and I'm trying not to say catastrophe. There's a lot of claims that are not related to catastrophes, and so the overall claims volume is going to be a function of not just one event, but a whole lot of events, some larger, some smaller, some that relate more to flooding, some that relate more to atmospherically driven events.", "So I would encourage you not to get overly focused and think that there's some enormous surge based on any one event. But it is the case that when there are more property claims, there's more call upon the Xactware platform. We have, by the way, in that business, we've worked to have a balance between committed subscriptions and transaction-based revenues. And, in fact, the mix has shifted more towards the committed volume side so that dampens the effect somewhat.", "Definitely it's the case that everybody gets more sensitized to the need for good modeling when there are large-scale events that go on and, yeah, rates generally tend to harden when there's more claims. So I think you did identify the cause-and-effect levers that are in there. Again, I would just say any one event or any one moment in the course of the year, don't overweigh it too much because there are a lot of different ways that there is damage to property and claims are being filed.", "William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Excellent. Thank you very much.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Welcome.", "Operator", ". Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Turner of SunTrust. Your line is now open.", "Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "I know you mentioned in the past that you continue to balance returns of capital versus M&A. Just wondering, can we expect returns of capital of a similar magnitude to the $500 million ASR in the future, or should this be viewed as a one-time in nature just given the EagleView?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's one-time. I mean, we had earmarked capital for a $650 million acquisition, which we were in pursuit of for about a year. And we felt that when it was clear that for the reasons I stated earlier, we weren't going to do the transaction, that the responsible thing to do where our shareholder were concerned was to return the capital to them. It doesn't infringe our opportunity to do M&A in the future. But at the same time, we felt that it was a responsible move at a particular moment in time but definitely in response to the one-time event of the EVT transaction.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I'll highlight...", "Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think we've always said we have a preferenced investor in our business and we always balance between acquisitions and then share repurchases, and this was just the right time given market conditions.", "Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "As there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time, I would now turn the call back to Mr. Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank You. We appreciate everybody joining us here for our Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. I appreciate your interest. And we look forward to seeing many of you at Investor Day next week, and of course we'll speak to you next quarter. Thanks for your time today.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice-President and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.", "Eva Huston", "Thank you, Jake, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2015 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "All the numbers we discussed today, unless otherwise stated, will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx. Interthinx is shown in discontinued operations reflecting the sale of the business in March 2014. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "And now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott Stephenson", "Thanks, Eva, good morning, all. In the first quarter we again delivered excellent results with total and organic revenue growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 22%.Profitability was strong with EBITDA growth of 18% and margins that continue to be industry leading. We\u2019re pleased with these results which we believe reflect the strength of our solutions and their value to our customers.", "During the quarter as you know we announced the $2.8 billion acquisition of Wood Mackenzie. We have received regulatory approval for the transaction and expect to close in the second quarter as we had previously stated after completing debt and equity offerings to fund the transaction.", "I had the chance recently to spend time with many of our new Wood Mac colleagues in a variety of offices around the globe, and I came away more impressed with the debt, expertise and professionalism of the team. And we could not be more excited to welcome the Wood Mac team into the Verisk family.", "Wood Mac is the global data analytics company with a culture very much like our own. We\u2019re adding a truly Verisk like business, one which offers its customers industry standard solutions based on proprietary data. The solutions are primarily provided through recurring subscriptions which benefit from network effects and scale economies. Like Verisk, Wood Mac has demonstrated an ability to grow by adding value through all of its customer\u2019s business cycles over a very long period of time.", "In the first quarter, Wood Mac grew revenue in the high single digits as measured in pounds. Because of our combined free cash flow generating capabilities and the strength of the Verisk balance sheet we will be able to acquire Wood Mac with the benefit of an appropriate level of financial leverage. Our use of a prudent mix of debt and equity allows us to maintain our investment grade credit rating.", "With regard to capital allocation for buybacks we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in December of 2014, as a result we had no incremental repurchases during the quarter. And once we are on track to meet our commitment to de-lever to 2.5 times gross debt to EBITDA we will manage our repurchase program as a part of our balanced use of capital. Our existing authorization at the end of the quarter was about $190 million.", "We continue to focus on innovation throughout our businesses as we believe this will enable us to deliver value to our customers and therefore strong financial results for the long term. A great example is our ongoing innovation effort that we announced recently with the launch of ISO ClaimSearch DNA. Some of you may have seen a demo at our Investor Day in March. With this new solution, PMC insurers can better visualize large networks of suspicious activity operating across the industry.", "DNA magnifies the power of ISO ClaimSearch which recently passed the $1 billion Claims mark to find patterns of potential fraud in increasingly large data sets and the detect entire networks of organized activity among individuals and businesses including related service providers.", "The patent tending technology provides a fully automated solutions proactive fraud network detection. The advanced analytics and predicted models work seamlessly to uncover hidden relationships across large data sets and to prioritize the networks of interest for each customer. ISO ClaimSearch DNA also provides insurers with alerts and actionable intelligence on their suspicious networks and claims for further investigation.", "Organized fraud often affects multiple carriers. So an industry wide perspective is essential to helping companies fight large scale fraud by giving them the whole picture. This is one of many and various innovative solutions that we continue to develop. We continue to feel confident in our long term opportunities to grow shareholder value through a combination of innovation driven organic growth and prudent deployment of the capital including through our strategy driven M&A.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to cover the financial results in more detail.", "Mark Anquillare", "Thank you, Scott. In the first quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in the future. Revenue grew 12.1%. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, revenue grew 11.5%. The strong organic growth reflects the health of our business and the value we deliver to our customers through our mission critical solutions.", "Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 16.6% and 15.6% on an organic basis. We saw organic growth across all four categories led by financial services. Decision Analytics insurance grew 8.7% in the first quarter, the increase was driven by strong growth in underwriting solutions and good growth of catastrophe models, claims and loss quantification solutions. Touchstone continues to be a growth drive in the quarter and we were pleased with the contribution from [Indiscernible] as well.", "Financial services revenue from continuing operations increased 67.3% driven by strong overall performance bolstered by a significant onetime project around advertising effectiveness. This project yielded very nice profitable revenue in the quarter as well as intellectual property which we will leverage repeatedly as our advertising effect in this business grows. Excluding this project which had revenue around $11 million growth in the quarter was 15.1%. The advertising affect of this market is early in its development yet has significant long term potential.", "Healthcare revenue grew 17.5% as reported which increases in all solutions group led again by payment accuracy. The results in the quarter came in ahead of our expectations as the transaction nature of much of the business means we have lower visibility than in our other businesses, and we saw higher levels pass the revenue than anticipated.", "Our current forecast indicates growth will moderate as we move through the rest of the year. As you know our second half of the year is seasonally larger than the first half. We are expecting visibility in the Medicare Advantage business to increase as the year progresses.", "The changes in contract language we discussed with you last quarter took effect later in the year than we had anticipated. As we told you last quarter the Verisk health revenues for the first quarter 2014 would have been $58.4 million if reported on the basis of the new contract language. On that same basis, the first quarter of 2015 revenue would have been $68.4 million. Growth on a net basis was 17.2% just below the reported growth of the quarter.", "Specialized category revenue increased 16.5% in the first quarter and 4.3% on an organic basis. Maplecroft\u2019s $2.6 million in revenue in the quarter was in line with our expectations. We continue to see growth in the quarter from environmental health and safety solutions and we\u2019re seeing good traction from our commercial, weather and climate analytics.", "Risk Assessment of revenue grew 5.3% indicating the value to our long standing insurance customers. Industry standard insurance programs grew 5.5% reflecting our 2015 invoices which were effective January 1 and continued contribution from newer solutions.", "Our property specific rating underwriting information revenue grew 4.8% in the quarter; this increase was driven by higher transaction volumes from those customers who have not yet migrated through a subscription for a long term contract. We have focused on transitioning most of our customers to subscriptions over the past couple of years which provides us good visibility.", "Total EBITDA increased 18.3% to $216.3 million. The 28.9% increase in Decision Analytics EBITDA to $115.3 million was the result of growth in the business and improved operations particularly at Verisk Health. Decision Analytics EBITDA was also helped by some non-recurring project at Argus which was very profitable.", "And finally, Decision Analytics EBITDA includes about $4.4 million of fees related to the Wood Mac acquisition. Risk Assessment EBITDA increased 8.2% to $101 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management including \u2013 people led across following the fourth quarter talent realignment. We do expect to tie additional people as part of the realignment initiatives.", "Interest expense was up $823,000 primarily due to increased debt related to the funding of the accelerated share repurchase program. Total debt of short term and long term was about $1.3 billion at March 31, 2015.", "Our reported effective tax rate was 38.1% for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income increased 15.2% to $107.5 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully dilutive basis was $0.67 for the quarter an increase of 21.8%, the average diluted share count was 161.5 million in the quarter on March 31, 2015 our diluted share count was 161.7 million shares.", "Free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures increased 25.2% to $146.2 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2015. This represented 113.8% of EBITDA. As you know this quarter is a strong cash flow quarter for us given our January 1 cycle of invoices and industry standard programs.", "Capital expenditures decreased 31.5% to 24.8% in the quarter and were 5.4% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx of about $150 million up modestly from 2014. As of March 31, 2015 our cash and cash equivalents were $152.8 million. As you think about your models for the full year all of the following observations are before adding Wood Mac. You will recall that second quarter is when we have our annual increases and they cause a typical step up salary expenses.", "As I mentioned previously the Argus project work was very profitable. In addition, we anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $53 million. Fixed asset depreciation, amortization of about $110 million and a tax rate around 38%. Higher expected deprecation, amortization is due to internally developed software leading to new solutions moving into services sooner which we view as a positive for our business. Because of the accelerated share repurchase our share count will be down year-over-year in 2015.", "Based upon our current debt balances and maturities full year interest expense will be about $66 million. After Wood Mac transaction closes we will provide additional details to help you update your models with more granularity. Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We are seeing growth across multiple verticals and we are executing on our operational plans.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Eva for a comment before the Q&A.", "Eva Huston", "Thanks Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions. Also, given that the Wood Mac acquisition has not yet closed we will appreciate you focussing your questions on the Verisk quarter and business. And with that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair and Company. Your line is now open.", "William Blair", "Okay, thank you. Just want to add on Argus the media effectiveness can you elaborate I guess in more detail what it was and I guess on the financial impact I guess how profitable is it and then I guess also elaborate on the future and I guess you talked about retaining the intellectual property you know maybe you can repeat the works in the future.", "Mark Anquillare", "Yes thank you Tim, let me take that. This is Mark. The Argus business is very subscription oriented, because of the nature of advertising effect in this there is some project work either direct with customers or with partners. This is an opportunity to really build out a very interesting capability that we will be able to leverage and use it in the future. And I would tell you that I think we are optimistic that both that capability and database will be leveraged but I think it also kind of set the stage hopefully in the future for a longer term subscription along the same line.", "So, we are optimistic probably a little longer out. To answer your question, some of the work or a lot of the work that was performed in support of that project did take place or a part of it took place in 2014. So as you think about the first quarter in 2015 that was higher than our traditional margin it was a strong margin business as it affected the first quarter 2015.", "Scott Stephenson", "And Scott here, I\u2019ll just add that one of the things that\u2019s going on is the functionality that Argus represents any add effectiveness world is one that various players are becoming more familiar with more comfortable with and I think that probably from time to time there will be projects like this just because they kind of get started, they figure out what it\u2019s really about and then hopefully and often usually it matures into a longer term kind of a relationship.", "William Blair", "Okay, thanks. And then I guess on healthcare you made the comment that you expected to moderate I guess across the year, is it just tougher comparison is that something that you see I guess in the pipeline or something that\u2019s falling off that I guess it makes gives you that expectation?", "Mark Anquillare", "Yes sure Tim, let me take that. Obviously we were very pleased with the quarter at Verisk Health. As you kind of move forward, yes second half of the year is where a lot of the Medicare Advantage work comes in. We don\u2019t have quite the visibility on that as we said in the past it\u2019s a little more transactional in nature and we are just trying to make sure that we are going to appreciate that first quarter was a good one but we do see that there will be probably a little bit of ramp-down as we progress through the year as a relation to the comps and the lack of visibility into the perspective revenue streams.", "William Blair", "But is there \u2013 I guess would you be willing to frame it all I guess in the level of moderation than you expect?", "Mark Anquillare", "Tim, I think we tried to stay away from any specific guidance on this topic and you know as I said I think we feel good about the healthcare business. We like the fact that its growth is across all the segments but I think we\u2019ll stay away from any specific growth rate at this point.", "William Blair", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open", "Manav Patnaik", "Thank you, good morning everybody and congratulations on another impressive quarter. I just wanted to follow up on that add effect discretion; I mean clearly you guys have been talking about this for a couple of quarters. And I think I understand what the opportunity there is. I was hoping you could help us frame what the addressable market is from your piece of the pie, your share of what that market potentially is just to understand you know how we could frame the potential size of this business for you down the road?", "Scott Stephenson", "Manav, Scott here. Just a couple of things, one is, I would say that while interest in advertising effectiveness has effectively existed as long as advertising has existed. In reality we now have data sets and methods which allow us to look at the relationship between the signals which are put out and the response which is given to those signals. And our August team is very well equipped to work in this field both because of the content that we\u2019ve got but also the methods. And our general excellence actually add to large scale in analytics.", "So this is a category, down the way we are doing it that is relatively new. And so that to me is the primary framing thought here is that its\u2019 early days. The other thing that I would say is that the kind of work that we are doing applies to both traditional and new media.", "And we\u2019re working to bring the capability into all of those different domains. And so, when you\u2019re talking about the new media space for example, you tend to find some relatively large players. And it\u2019s very much a part of our plan and our goal to be working with a good number of them. So, that\u2019s not giving you sort of a total TAM for the opportunity, partly again because we\u2019re in early days. But we see this is as a very major opportunity.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay. Fair enough and just on the follow-up, on the Verisk Health side, you know, you mentioned that you saw some notable operational improvement on the healthcare side. I know you haven\u2019t given us absolute margins before. But can you maybe just help us understand the magnitude of that improvement, and if that is something we should see a sustainable going forward?", "Scott Stephenson", "We certainly expect that operational effectiveness will continue to grow at Verisk Health. It was a point of primary focus by our Verisk Health colleagues in 2014. It was reflected in what I would call material improvements in some of the core metrics that relate to for example, the RQI side of the business, and the team remains focused on taking it to an even higher level. So, you\u2019ve heard us say that we have felt and continue to feel that there is an opportunity, and that we will margin improvement in Verisk Health. And we stand by that.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay. Thanks a lot for the time, guys.", "Scott Stephenson", "You bet.", "Mark Anquillare", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "David Togut", "Thank you. Good morning Scott and Mark.", "Scott Stephenson", "Good morning.", "Mark Anquillare", "Good morning.", "David Togut", "We saw very strong margin expansion in the quarter, EBITDA margins up 250 basis points year-over-year. Historically, Scott you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re very long term focus in your investment program and you perhaps you could frame this for us recognizing that you did call out some one time high margin revenue in the quarter. Is this potentially the beginning of a trend where we start to see positive operating leverage going forward?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes.", "David Togut", "Can you elaborate?", "Scott Stephenson", "Well, we start with as I think everybody with us today knows. We start with a very highly efficient organization already. And we pay a lot of attention to that, benefited of course by the fact that we run our business in a way where fundamentally our model has scale and leverage built into it. So the starting point for the performance of our business with respect profitability is the nature of the business that we have and that we choose to build.", "But having said that, I don\u2019t think that there is anything in consistent with our long-term focus and our focus on organic revenue growth as being a particular measure, our vitality as an organization and booking for ways to operate our business with even more efficiency. So we don\u2019t feel as if we\u2019re engaging in any sort of a trade off between the near term and the long-term even as we give a great deal of attention to the efficiency of our operations. Mark, I don\u2019t if you want to add anything to that.", "Mark Anquillare", "No. I agree. I just will kind of call out a few things that we try to talk about as we discuss here this morning, Argus, clearly that revenue was very highly profitable. Two, we talked about the [Indiscernible] Verisk Health for the most part that as it move gross to net that will actually help margins just mathematically. Offsetting that I want to highlight that there is an element of talent realignment in our industry standard programs and we will be hiring back. There we will also see some salary increases across the universe and the enterprise, so those are couple of things we need to consider in the second quarter and beyond. Finally, we did have about $4.4 million of fees related to Wood Mac that we called out here in the first quarter. Obviously there will be some more in second quarter.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Toni Kaplan", "Hi, thanks. So, I\u2019m looking at the Decision Analytics, insurance line, the growth rate tends to jump around there. So, I was wondering if there was anything that basically anything that depressed the growth rate in this quarter and how we should think about the full year for that one.", "Scott Stephenson", "Yeah. I mean, I would not point at any macro factors which would really have explanatory power there. Couple of things that are always just kind of there in the background but they kind of wash in one direction and they will wash in another direction. One would be just levels of claims activity which tends to related to both our loss quantification activities as well as our \u2013 it create a climate which is supportive for catastrophe modeling in the general sense.", "And then, there can be from time-to-time consolidation particularly not really among the primary insurers but more with respect to some of the brokers and some of the maybe the second tier reinsurers. And so from time to time there\u2019s a little bit of that. And so you have those kinds of factors that are kind of in there. But substantially what we do is actually subscription base and long term in nature and that continues to be the case.", "Toni Kaplan", "Okay, great. And then just on the international expansion opportunity in financial services, just wanted to ask how you see that in terms of timing, I guess this is into Wood Mac question, but given that Wood Mac is global, does that accelerate your sort of process of expanding internationally and financial services and what steps you need to take in terms of adapting to new geographies in that product line.", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes. So, we do believe actually that we are in the process of re-platforming Verisk globally in a way that will be supportive of. We hope and expect many, many parts of our business, but specifically to Argus, the way you should think of that is it\u2019s a little bit of a step function and what I mean by that is that lying at the center of the Argus business just as with many other parts of Verisk. You\u2019ve got these very rich datasets which are contributory from the same companies that service our primary customers. And so there is kind of a critical math sort of a quality in any given market where once you get, once we get enough of the leaders saying that they want to come in to the consortium model it tends to then cause much of the rest of the market to come along.", "And so, you sort of have these step function changes in state where you sort of aren\u2019t at critical math until you are. And once you are critical math it all begins to change a little bit. And so, even recently and confirming with our Argus colleagues we heard some exciting news about specific markets. But you should just understand it as there will be movements and time in which any given market, any particular market sort of becomes a part of the Argus model. And that is the way we build a market at a time.", "Toni Kaplan", "Thanks a lot. Congrats on the quarter.", "Scott Stephenson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "James Friedman", "Hi. Thanks. Just ask my two upfront. One housekeeping, one Mark, the CapEx decline significantly year-over-year and I know you\u2019ve made some comments about the Q2 CapEx expectation if you could comment why that might happened in the first quarter. And then secondly, with regard to ISO, could you help quantify what some of the cost rationalizations might have been in the quarter that would be helpful? Thank you.", "Mark Anquillare", "Sure. Let me take the first from a CapEx perspective. We did do some moving of offices and we were moving also our data centers last year and first quarter, so we had some high CapEx in 1Q, 2014. And I think we also started or at least done from our [Indiscernible] inflows of a CapEx seems like there maybe a little bit of movement of CapEx to get some year-end deals from vendors pertain to 2014 which seem to keep the CapEx dollars really low relative to past history in first quarter of 2015. So, I would tell you that we kind keep \u2013 we kept our full year forecast generally unchanged. We just think it kind of moves into second and third quarter and I wouldn\u2019t really point anything expect for timing with regard to the CapEx number.", "Second question I think was a little about the talent realignment inside of our industry standard programs. We\u2019ve have great people and great talent inside the iPass team, the iPass team represents one of the units that industry standard program. And I think we wanted to recognize the efforts of those people over the years and we from most part offer the package so that we could get some new talent that is focused on new opportunities.", "This is an opportunity to become more efficient with our core business, be more effective with our core business. And at the same time kind of backfill position so that we can aim point to the future with new opportunities and expansion. And I think the hiring to backfill those position is a little bit delay. We want to get the right people and we wanted to get the right position filled as soon as possible but that\u2019s causing it. I would tell you that we\u2019re probably in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 positions, does that help, Jim.", "James Friedman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Andrew Steinerman", "I want to review DA insurance, 9% looks very solid to me, but the question is around year-over-year comparisons in particular and when I look at 9% growth in the first quarter versus the 12% growth. The fourth quarter, I come away taking perhaps it has to do with the year-over-year comparisons being about 4.5% more difficult in the first quarter and what might be the implications going it into the second quarter here and there\u2019s also a larger year-over-year comparison for DA insurance?", "Mark Anquillare", "So, let me try to answer your question maybe more qualitatively and then I can maybe address that. So, couple of things always happen, one there is some project oriented revenue as it relates to the catastrophe modeling, the timing of cat bonds and things like that that we called out before, that cause I think a little bit of a comp relative to first quarter 2014 but not material, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s was anything noteworthy there.", "The other thing some times relates to the timing of new customers, so its sometimes a bit of grow over as an example inside of the loss quantification I know that we had a reasonably large customer that came on in first quarter 2014, obviously that customer was customer 2014 also in 2015. So, I think as we think forward from an insurance perspective. I think second quarter you\u2019re probably right, a little bit tougher comp, but we have a consistency. We have a subscription and I think we feel that we\u2019re going to be in good shape probably a little bit more of a second half story from an DA insurance perspective.", "Andrew Steinerman", "Great. And 9% for DA insurance feels like a pretty normal growth rate for you, right?", "Scott Stephenson", "I think the business is substantially, well, entirely the same business that it was, the only thing I would add is as this year progresses I think we\u2019re going to have some very exciting things to be able to talk about in terms of the expansion of some of thing for doing specifically on the DA side of insurance, and we look forward to being able to talk about those. These are innovations and partnerships and customer relationships.", "So it actually feels very good. The nature of those businesses is that they are very, very embedded with their customers and behind that we have a series of innovations that I think are really quite exciting.", "Andrew Steinerman", "Sounds good, Scott. Thank you.", "Scott Stephenson", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you feel would be the trajectory or seasonality in healthcare. I know that\u2019s usually backend loaded, I know you have some different comps. So not really guidance but the way that it worked in the past has been more backend loaded, so I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on sort of how this year looks, and if that\u2019s change versus other years?", "Mark Anquillare", "Sure. I will tell you that we\u2019ll probably see about the same split or the same balance between first half and second half. Second half is typically a 60% relative, first half being a 40% type of total. The swing or the nature of that disparity is really in the Medicare Advantage business. It\u2019s more transactional and because Medicare and what we refer to those Medicare suites typically runs from July through the beginning of \u2013 end of January that\u2019s what causes that. Now when those transaction volumes happens whether its third quarter or fourth quarter it lies in the first, it\u2019s a little tough to be very specific about that.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And then just on the pricing in the insurance DA or other insurance business can you talk about your relative pricing power versus this year versus all the years and if there\u2019s been any change there.", "Scott Stephenson", "No change.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Bill Warmington", "Good morning everyone.", "Mark Anquillare", "Good morning.", "Bill Warmington", "So, one question for you on the margin and very strong performance this quarter, if you add back to Wood Mac closing cost, it would put you about 48.1%. And I know that when you started out few years ago with the 43% to 45% long-term target and then after the Sale of Interthinx, that went up to 45% to 47% range. And then given that strong performance in this quarter adjusted through Wood Mac and in fact that the gross to net in the healthcare isn\u2019t yet in the numbers, should we be thinking about that upper end of that range moving up going forward?", "Scott Stephenson", "Again, we feel \u2013we were very committed to running the business with efficiency and we feel that we are steadily finding those efficiencies and we do a fire to run a business which is as profitable as it can be and at the same time is growing strongly especially organically over long periods of time and we\u2019re still on that March. And we don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t feel that we have exhausted all of the opportunities to operate efficiently. At the same time there is always the counter balancing points that we\u2019re introducing new innovations, even yesterday we were sitting down and looking at an investment that we\u2019re going to initiate this year to pursue one of those exciting opportunities that I was just talking about as it relates to DA. So there\u2019s always a balance there.", "But just as was the case, when we started out in the 43% to 45% range that didn\u2019t mean that we relax our interest in becoming more efficient and profitable and we\u2019re still on exactly at that same mode.", "Bill Warmington", "Okay. And then my second question on the discrete network analysis module, just wanted to ask if you could frame what you thought that opportunity was and what kind of a contributor that was likely to be either to \u2013 and how we should think about the time frame there, 2015, 2016?", "Scott Stephenson", "Well, yes, the work is ongoing and I say by the way that is another good example of the Verisk way of doing innovation because one of our confidence points on this work is that its been done with close collaboration and consultation with customers, which is a very, very important part of our process.", "I think what remains to be seen is how much the effect of claim CNA is reinforcing the overall ClaimSearch franchise versus how much it will generate incremental especially identifiable incremental revenue streams. But when I think about value to the customer, the opportunity to be able to essentially interrogate the data and there\u2019s much more big data kind of way, I think the value will be significant, how we chose to commercialize and monetize that, that\u2019s -- think that\u2019s a little down the road, yeah.", "Bill Warmington", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.", "Alex Kramm", "Hi, good morning. Just, sorry to come back to the margin, but doing some of the math here myself, if I just look at Decision Analytics, and I assume that this project in Argus was about 80% margin and maybe that being conservative and I just for the one-timer and pass through, I get to about 41%.", "So first of all is that in the ballpark and if I compare this to a year ago, I think that\u2019s about 350 basis points margin expansion. So, maybe you can just break this down where you think that margin expansion came from in terms of efficiencies and on the healthcare side and maybe scale you gaining and other things you want to point out?", "Andrew Steinerman", "Yes. Thank you. Let me try to help you out that. I understand your math and I think it\u2019s reasonable with regard to the project revenue. I think we try to call out that the nature of our business is across the board have natural scale to it and the incremental margins are extremely high, its how much investment we put in. We continue to have a consistent level there.", "Verisk Health, I think was one of the nice positives inside the quarter. We would expect that to continue, obviously as revenue typically is a little lighter in second quarter relative to the other quarters that may work against us in the quarter, but Verisk Health is the biggest contributor to that, that good news. And I think we would as Scott suggested I think we would expect that to continue.", "Alex Kramm", "Okay. Helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just on the imagery side. I think you talked post-EVP that\u2019s an area that you still want to get better, there\u2019s some investments. So, A, is that meaningfully depressing margins right now. Are you still doing a lot of investments there and any update on where you at in terms of competing with that business and getting bigger piece of the pie?", "Scott Stephenson", "So, my earlier reference to some exciting developments in 2015, this category will definitely be one of them. The way that you need to understand this category is that they\u2019re really actually two things you have to do in order to be able to create commercial solutions for a customer. One is you have to have methods by which you can in a highly automated way take an image and turn it into data.", "And the second thing is you need images which are sufficient to what it is that you\u2019re trying to do. Our methods are world class and you heard our or you saw our announcement about AMS Geomatics that\u2019s all part of that. And we really have a team and a set of capabilities we put up against anybody. What we haven\u2019t working on is how we are going to infuse those methods with a very comprehensive set of images.", "And we are laying some extremely exciting plans in place right now not able to talk about them just yet, but we will come back on those, not really influencing margins very much at the movement and we actually think the approach that were coming up with here it probably will \u2013 there will be maybe a minor effect but we\u2019re going to manage this is a way that we believe there\u2019s a good chance, but as revenues mounts they\u2019ll be matching and exceeding ultimately the expenses, but that will be a little bit of build through time. But they were very, very focused on those categories.", "Andrew Steinerman", "All right, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Andre Benjamin", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Scott Stephenson", "Good morning.", "Andre Benjamin", "Question on the healthcare business, I was wondering if you can maybe give a little color on the drivers of the growth particular how much is from new clients versus your existing clients just running more volume through the business and/or how much of it is from those same clients maybe buying more products from within the suites you offer?", "Scott Stephenson", "You always going to find those three things in the mix, Andre and I would say that something that is always very important to us and something that is always very encouraging to us is when we find existing customers moving into new parts of our suites. And we definitely all of those are represented in the mix including first quarter 2015.", "Andre Benjamin", "And I guess in conversation with the same customer I was wondering are there any notable thoughts or feedback that you\u2019ve gotten with respect to how they\u2019re thinking about the changes in Medicare reimbursement rules and the management of your products?", "Mark Anquillare", "Well you know that\u2019s always going to be a part of their thinking and they and we both pay close attention to what CMS is doing. I would say that I think what is really leading the thought process for our customers in this category it\u2019s probably less what\u2019s going on in the regulatory environment and it\u2019s more about their own thoughts on how to maximize their own performance basically. And so, it\u2019s literally then trying to do their good work and manage their businesses to highest level of performance and I think that\u2019s the greater factor in how they are choosing to manage the way that they engage with CMS and therefore that part of our business which is about that, which is over in RQI it\u2019s more their own thoughts about that own businesses that\u2019s really what is the leading factor.", "Andre Benjamin", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Anjaneya Singh", "Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First off on just the advertising effectiveness project revenue you discussed you know the opportunity around this quite a bit in the past and on this call. I\u2019m wondering as we look forward if the project revenues are is what should be you know expected in these types of solutions or if subscription based engagements might also be possible at this early juncture?", "Scott Stephenson", "Subscription based engagements are definitely possible and are occurring even at this time. And really what we were trying to indicate with our comments was simply that it may well be the case that from time to time as the category emerges there will be individual larger players who get interested and there is sort of at a moment in time there is a high degree of engagement as they assess the methods and figure out exactly you know what they can do and what they will mean for them, which we hope and expect will sort of mature into ongoing subscription like relationships.", "Anjaneya Singh", "Okay that\u2019s helpful. And a question for Mark, you talked about the risk assessment talent realignment savings being invested back into the business and I appreciate the comments on the 30 or 40 positions you need to sell. Wondering if you can discuss what your expected timeline is to fully work through those hiring plans just trying to get a sense of when RA margins may work back down to a more normalized level?", "Mark Anquillare", "Sure, I mean I\u2019ll give you my best timeline. I mean, our goal continue to be find the right people because we want to move and kind of create some exciting opportunities in markets, the new product ideas. But if you think about Verisk as a whole, it\u2019s about people and intellectual capital is so important, so we just need to right people. I think we would have hoped to have many of those position filled in the first quarter and if I said second quarter I know things will roll into the third, but I think we are actively kind of fill those positions with the right people and are looking to do so as quickly as possible.", "Anjaneya Singh", "Appreciated. Thanks you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Scott Stephenson", "Well, thank you. And we appreciate everybody being with us this quarter. Appreciate your support and your interest and we look forward to talking with you at the conclusion of the second quarter. Enjoy your day.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.", "Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Chief Knowledge Officer", "Thank you, Dorothy, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2015 and full year 2015 financial results.", "With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "The earnings release referenced on the call, as well as the associated 10-K, can be found in the Investors section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until March 24, 2016, on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.", "And now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Eva. And good morning, everyone. We reported another year of industry-leading high-single-digit organic revenue growth with margin expansion and excellent free cash flow generation.", "Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations, with total revenue growth of about 21% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 23%. Full year revenue grew 18% and diluted adjusted EPS increased about 29%. We grew the top line, excluding the healthcare analytics business and recent acquisitions, over 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year. Profitability was strong as adjusted EBITDA excluding acquisitions grew about 7% in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 47% in the quarter and 48% for the full year.", "We continue to work on our comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for the healthcare analytics business. There is a range of alternatives and not solely limited to a sale of the business. As responsible stewards of shareholder capital, we are being methodical and thoughtful in our approach. The volatility of the equity and leverage markets in the last quarter of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 has contributed to the timing of our efforts. We expect to be able to provide you with an update by the time we report first quarter earnings.", "We're always looking to innovate to drive growth at Verisk. For example, in our insurance business one of the solutions which has been contributing to growth in Risk Assessment is the ISO electronic rating content suite. We rolled out new features including an automated maintenance feed that allows insurers to import the most recent changes to ISO loss costs and rating algorithms directly into their rating systems. This is innovation which helps our customers to implement rate changes more quickly and more efficiently.", "In other recent news, WoodMac announced a commercial alliance with Thomson Reuters. This alliance gives customers of the Eikon platform a direct link to WoodMac's oilfield data and research. The information and analysis we are providing includes crude oil production, oil product balances and stocks, oil product prices, crack spreads and refining margins. This is an important new channel for WoodMac, extending our reach to customers we were largely not already serving.", "Looking at capital deployment, we are on track to meet our deleveraging commitment even as we have made a number of tuck-in acquisitions and returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases.", "We made a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter for about $50 million. We acquired Infield Systems including its proprietary database of offshore asset prices. We also acquired PCI Group, which has proprietary data assets and deep chemical industry domain expertise. These two acquisitions complement and enhance our data and capabilities at WoodMac very nicely.", "During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of over $20 million of stock. Our remaining authorization at the end of 2015 was $469 million after a $300 million increase in December, and we remain buyers of our stock at current levels. We are committed to a prudent mix of M&A and share repurchases over time to complement and enhance our core businesses. This combination positions us very well to deliver the kinds of shareholder returns over the next several years that we expect of ourselves and you expect of us.", "Our initiatives during the past year position us well to execute on our plans for 2016 and we're constructive on the outlook. We expect our combined insurance businesses will grow at least as fast as they did in 2015. This reflects the quality and value of the solutions we provide and the strength of our relationships. As we discussed at Investor Day in December, we expect WoodMac to grow in constant currency, even when excluding the effect of Infield and PCI.", "Given the end market dynamics, we think this is a strong reflection of the quality of our team, the strength of our intellectual property and the depth of our customer relationships. Our health care business grew 6% in 2015 with expanding margins, and we anticipate a higher rate of growth and additional margin expansion in 2016. We also expect Argus to grow double-digits for the full year 2016, even with the one-time project revenue we had in the first quarter of 2015.", "Over and above all of this, in 2016 we will strengthen our foundation. Our internal environment for handling large amounts of diverse data types is rapidly and continuously improving. Our data assets, already among the largest private data sets in the world, will expand. And our global footprint, a key to providing organic growth opportunities over the long term, is now in place and growing. Verisk is today one of the world's most valuable, vertically oriented data analytics companies. Our robust plans to the year 2020 will lead to new levels of distinction and performance.", "So with that let me turn it over to Mark to cover the financials in more detail.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Scott. For the fourth quarter, we again delivered solid revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing for the future.", "Revenue grew 20.6% in the fourth quarter and 18.4% for the full year. Net of healthcare pass-through revenue, and excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, total revenue grew 3.9% in the fourth quarter and 7.4% for the full year.", "Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the second quarter hedge gain and WoodMac one-time acquisition costs, grew 22.5% to $263 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew 24% to $996 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 47.4%, excluding the $15.6 million third quarter warrant gain. And adjusted EBITDA margins excluding healthcare, acquisitions, and third quarter warrant gains were over 50% for the quarter and year-to-date.", "Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter and 5.3% excluding healthcare and acquisitions. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by insurance. For the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 25.9% and 9.3% excluding healthcare and acquisitions.", "Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by strong growth in loss quantification solutions with good contributions from insurance, anti-fraud claim solutions, and underwriting solutions. Catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to the growth. Full year Decision Analytics insurance growth was a solid 8.1%.", "Financial Services revenue declined 2.6% in the quarter due to project work in the prior-year period which did not recur this year. For the full year Financial Services revenue grew 20.5% as a result of media effectiveness project revenue and continued demand for analytic solutions and services in the U.S. and notably expanding globally.", "The Healthcare business again performed slightly ahead of our internal forecast. Net of pass through revenue, Healthcare declined 2.4% in the quarter but grew 6.2% for the full year. Population solutions led the growth in the quarter while payment solutions led the growth for the full year. All areas contributed to full year growth and full year margins improved versus 2014.", "Energy and specialized revenue increased 410% in the fourth quarter and 264% for the full year. Organic growth in the quarter was 4.3% and for the full year 5.1%. Commercial weather and climate analytics and environmental health and safety solutions led the growth.", "WoodMac revenue in pounds and on a comparable basis declined 1% in the quarter and increased approximately 5% for the full year. For the period of our ownership, WoodMac contributed $211 million, slightly ahead of what we discussed with you last quarter despite exchange rate headwind.", "We're pleased with WoodMac's performance in an extraordinary time for their customers. Annual contract value of signings were up in 2015. Customer retention remained strong and client engagement as measured by portal activity was up 26% versus 2014.", "Turning to Risk Assessment. Revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter, indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment was due in part to 5.5% revenue growth of industry-standard insurance programs resulting primarily from growth in 2015 invoices effective from January 1. Property-specific rating and underwriting revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. Growth was a result of new sales with higher committed volumes. For the full year, Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.8% driven by 6% growth in industry standard programs and 5.1% growth in the property-specific rating and underwriting category.", "As I mentioned earlier, EBIT (sic) [EBITDA] increased 22.5% in the quarter to $263 million resulting in EBITDA margins of 46.9%. Decision Analytics adjusted EBIT (sic) [EBITDA] increased 30.8% to $161 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions, growth of the business and lower professional services fees.

Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you for the commentary about your revenue expectations. Could you talk about what gives you confidence that you'll be able to grow WoodMac in constant currency in 2016, given the 1% decline in the quarter? I know you're not going to give details about subscription versus service, but any color about what you were seeing on the subscription side, particularly around renewals would be very helpful?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So retention of customers remain strong and even in the first month-and-a-half of 2016 we're seeing strong year-over-year growth in terms of numbers of research subscriptions clients. We are seeing a increase in use of the portal, customer engagement is up 6% already in the year. So these are the kinds of things which basically relate to where we stand with our customers and is the source of our expectations for the year.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And so, I guess, is the expectation on the service side that you would continue to see pretty significant declines there, but it's less important as it becomes a smaller piece of the total?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we're not really breaking that out, as you know, Sara, but I mean, our plan is for the whole business to perform.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then just separately on margins. Could you give us any color on how you're thinking about margins in 2016? Particularly because there were some hiring plans in Risk Assessment, I'm wondering if those have started to come through or if you would expect to ramp that next year or this year?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Good question. This is Mark, Sara. So first of all, let's start with 2015. We had some one-time items: the hedge gain, WoodMac transactions, the EVT, the warrant gains. So we'll pull that out and we remain positive and constructive with regard to margins in 2016. I do want to highlight two things that we tried to do. One, specifically, the talent realignment you mentioned. We would and we do expect people to be hired back to former levels. That's probably about 50 people, just to kind of give you a flavor of things, like around (18:31). And the other thing we did try to call out is that the project revenue of Argus in first quarter of 2015 was about $11 million. It had very high margins. So you have to just factor those two things in and hopefully that gives you some color on where we stand.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great.

Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "The first question just around WoodMac again. I was just wondering if you could help characterize your organic growth guidance of WoodMac next year in the context of what you're assuming the energy environment is? And then also maybe in context, like is this, the Thomson Reuters announcement that you did, a sign of more to come and is that maybe a material contributor to showing that growth number for 2016?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We think there are additional channels for getting WoodMac content to market and we actually think that the number of customers that WoodMac will have in the years to come will be substantially greater than it is today and part of that is in fact the new channels. And we're very early in the journey on that particular front but I would definitely expect additional channel partnerships as a way of supplementing growth at WoodMac.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And just on the assumption for the energy environment...?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we're never going to be folks to predict the price of oil. The thing that is our real bedrock on this business is the depth of relationship that WoodMac has with its customers. We actually performed in the fourth quarter or we completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 our Net Promoter Score assessment across all of Verisk and WoodMac came in with the second highest Net Promoter Scores across all of Verisk. Their customers love them. I was with the deputy chair of one of the name brand global energy companies a couple of weeks ago and they just \u2013 they love WoodMac and they find the content and the analysis absolutely indispensable and that's really the foundation of the business.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And then just real quickly I know in the comments you mentioned that you expect insurance growth to be at least as good as 2015. I was wondering if there was anything, any puts and takes to call out between the two divisions when we think about our models for the year?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Looking at you, Mark, I mean, it's kind of broad based. It's across almost everything that we do actually. Underwriting was strong in 2015, will be strong in 2016. I wouldn't really differentiate greatly among the different parts of what it is we do.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I agree.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks. Just on healthcare, I guess, can you elaborate what gives you reason to think that it will grow faster in 2016? And then you also alluded to obviously there's more options than just selling healthcare that you're looking at. Can you, if you're able to talk at all about what other options are front and center on the table right now?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, maybe your second question first. So from the very beginning we had all options on the table taking a very thorough look at the business and how to maximize value for our shareholders and the standing of the business and so nothing changed. There is nothing changed in that regard.", "When we look at the growth of the business, part of it is we actually are having success in generating new revenue streams. I think you know that there was a lot of what we did on the revenue side that was related to Medicare Advantage. We started to do more work on the commercial side and that's a nice supplement to what we've traditionally done in the business.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. And then just on Argus, the marketing effectiveness type of projects, I know there's a tough comp in Q1 but when you gave your outlook in 2016 in terms of double-digit growth, are you counting on any other large lumpy projects at some point during the year when you say that?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think we've been \u2013 I think we've \u2013 for some time now been trying to make it clear that there are large name brand companies that sort of get interested in the methods and when they come in, they come in a fairly big way. There have actually been several of those in the course of 2015 and into 2016 that will be a part of the growth overall. So there will continue to be sort of these breakout kinds of moments. But as we've said, the project then ripens (23:38) into a sustainable subscription and that's fully what we expect.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.", "Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, thank you. I caught the commentary from Mark in terms of annual contract value growth at WoodMac for the full year but as the year progressed, mainly as we got into the back half and into early 2016, has there been any weakening in bookings trend at WoodMac?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I mentioned we've typically talked (sic) [not talked] about bookings. What I can tell you is that from a retention perspective, what we've seen in the end of the year and into even January/February is we've had retention rates that are consistent with \u2013 consistently high with what we saw for full year 2014 and 2015. So we're comfortable, actually a kind of very good part of the WoodMac business is that retention with the customers. We also mentioned kind of broadly that the bookings have been up so that's the good news. I'm not sure we're not going to give color dating back to prior to ownership. I'm not sure we have that detail with us. Sorry.", "Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then just thinking about healthcare quarterly modeling, with the shift in mix towards I guess de-emphasizing a little bit Medicare Advantage as a percentage of mix in favor of commercial, how much does the seasonality shift in healthcare relative to prior years?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So the short answer is that, I think we've talked about this in quite a bit of detail, but the MRA business, and the medical side of it in CMS, runs the SWEEPS from July to January, February. Typically what happens is the commercial side of this nicely fits in with \u2013 more in the first half of the year. But we're not going to talk as much about the details of Verisk Health given the strategic alternative process we're engaged in.", "Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Can you give us a sense of I guess how pricing conversations have been going for WoodMac just as the year has progressed? And whether margins are still sort of \u2013 we should expect that sort of mid-40% number is still the right way to be thinking about it?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So I think the reality is the contract renewals, given the nature of the customers and the pain our customers are feeling, is kind of one that is a little bit more challenging. We've tried to bundle solutions. We've tried to do things that kind of provide value to them and also provide us upside to the extent that the CapEx spend and profitability returns to our customers as they use more solutions that will give us some upside.", "I think the combination of some of the work that we're doing to make the business; I'll call it a little bit more industrial \u2013 strength around IT and also to invest in the sales pipeline that gives us an extension to more people to sell it to.", "But we've been investing from a sales perspective more, and we've also from a technology perspective so we can, for the most part, take some of the solutions and maybe smaller swaps and maybe more confined view, a little bit more downstream in the sense of smaller customers. And that will hopefully help us in the top line. So those investments probably have taken margins down a little bit and we would expect that in 2016 as well.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And just, if you could give just a little bit more color on the business model of the Thomson Reuters partnership; is that going to be considered subscription? Or is it more like one \u2013 like data feed? And are you providing sort of data at a lower rate than you would in a direct subscription? And is there a similar margin profile for that? Thanks.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So let me try to take your questions, I'm not sure I'm going to do them in sequence but let me give it my best shot. First of all, the way the relationship with Reuters would be is it would be a kind of a subscription and access to a limited scope amount of information. If you wanted more you can buy different modules and different pieces. We've tried to take the data and cut some very big products into maybe smaller subsets, and provide it in a way that more people would be interested in it. Different groups of people, different customer sets.", "So once again, the nature of the information businesses that we have, we would expect one, to be subscription; two, not a lot of incremental cost once you sell that implementation service, not a lot of incremental cost there. So I think we feel pretty good about the margins.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Hi. You spoke a little fast I believe in the prepared remarks on WoodMac like-for-like growth in the fourth quarter, and does that include the couple of small WoodMac acquisitions? And if so, what would be the organic fourth quarter number, like-for-like?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So like-for-like is a negative 1%. So we said that it was in the quarter negative 1%, comparable basis and that was in pounds. And we said 5% full year.

Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hello, Bill.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So I wanted to ask about the \u2013 if you look at the normalized, organic, constant currency growth rate for 2016, I think it would be helpful if you could frame for us the basis for drag that you're getting from WoodMac? I understand that WoodMac is still growing positively on a constant currency basis for 2016, but I'm trying to get at this normalized, organic, constant currency growth for 2016?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Bill, I think we're not going to give specific guidance. I think we've said it's going to grow next year, I think we feel good about the business. You've heard that. So I'm not sure I can directly answer your question without giving you a specific point target for WoodMac, which I'm not going to give here today.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Well, the \u2013 okay. Then second question. There's been some speculation in the media that you guys have been looking at Argus. Now I don't think any of us would expect you to comment on that speculation, though my question is what are you considering doubling-down in energy? By that I mean making a sizable acquisition in the energy space?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we're always thinking about where do we sit and where do we want to go with respect to our customers. And I will say that having a sense, a good sense of where the price of the commodity is going as a part of a lot of the modeling that is already built into what it is that WoodMac does today.", "So at a general level I would say that understanding the entire supply and demand picture is a useful thing to do. Now we already \u2013 I mean, if you subscribe to WoodMac product, you know that there are views of forward prices as well as the supply side volume as well as dollar value. So that will all continue to be a part of what we do and our thought process is entirely around what is it that we can do to bring more value to our customers and when we put A and B together do we unlock even more value for our customers? So we're constantly thinking about everything that we can do to increase value so I'm not going to comment on that specific situation but just generally we're very active in thinking about where we are and where we ought to be.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One of the conversations I've heard you had with investors over the last 12 months to 18 months with regard to healthcare is the sort of value of the data in your healthcare business compared to the data across your other businesses and I assume that the relative value of healthcare data is one of the things that has led to this exploration of alternatives.", "We recently saw IBM buy Truven for a pretty big price tag. How does that influence your overall view of the value of the healthcare data in your business? Is it distinct from Truven's data? Just a little compare/contrast and whether or not sort of directionally that influences the range of outcomes possibly for that business at Verisk?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, so first of all our business, there are I would say small overlaps with Truven. In fact there are bilateral commercial agreements between us and Truven. But in general, their business is by degrees different than our business. So I wouldn't really use it as a particularly meaningful marker and we're very focused on how to \u2013 the business that we've got, what are the future opportunities, how can they be maximized and how do we maximize shareholder value for our shareholders? So yes, of course we've referenced things that are going on like that transaction but in reality I think that our situation is relatively custom.", "To the point about data, the basic point I would make to you is that obviously data is very important in the data analytic kind of work that we do and others do and everyone \u2013 all of the third-party vendors do but the distinction that we're trying to draw is when you look at the vast majority of the data that we've got inside of the insurance vertical, the financial services, retail banking vertical, and the oil and gas, metals and mining vertical, a lot of what we've got is very, very unique. The nature of regulation and industry structure in the healthcare world in the United States makes it relatively harder to have distinct data assets. That's the point that we've trying to stress. So it's not that we don't have data. We actually have a lot of data. But we very much want Verisk to be a highly distinctive, very differentiated partner to our customers. And one of the things that provides distinction is unique data assets. And they're just harder to achieve in the healthcare space.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Scott G.

And could that have a favorable revenue impact maybe looking forward to 2017?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, let me remind you of the goal of the talent realignment. We did try to take what would be our more traditional ISO solutions business inside of Risk Assessment and focus this on kind of a shared services model, trying to take groups and become more efficient and more effective. And I congratulate the team on the work that was done there. We then took those resources and we said we were going to kind of invest in new products and in new segments. And our hope is that, yeah, that type of investment would lead us towards kind of sustainable growth in the future. And it's probably a little bit of a longer-term march than a short-term march but we're optimistic like we described earlier in those initiatives.", "With regard to timing, I think we've seen quite a few people hired in the latter part of 2015 and into the first quarter here of 2016. So although, I think you're right, it will kind of extend throughout the year, I think there's a little bit more of a push or an emphasis here in the first half.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'll just add, I am very excited by the quality of the people we're attracting into the business. These are world-class people, global perspective. They are definitely going to help raise our analytic sights and just the quality and depth of what it is we do. It's very, very encouraging to people that we can attract to Verisk.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. And lastly on the tax on amortization. I think the guidance there was 26% before and now it's up to 28%. I was just curious what drove the increase?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So what we did was we took a best guess back at the time. And remember, the world of purchase accounting and developing how much amortization runs through your books is something that won't be finalized until mid-2016. We gave you our best guess, we have a more refined estimate as to how much amortization is coming through and the amount as it relates to WoodMac is down a little bit from those original estimates, meaning that the U.K. rate is a little less pronounced or weighted in the calculation.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the answers.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group", "Scott, I appreciated your dimensions you shared on the growth prospects for 2016. I wanted to ask you about your comment about your insurance assets. Would you anticipate that both RA and insurance in DA will accelerate next year?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group", "Okay. And then if you could comment \u2013 I know that pricing is working through the system now on the ISO database and Risk Assessment. So, could you update us as to how much of that is still on the look back of prior period premiums and what some of the inputs are for pricing on RA overall?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So we, I think we have shared with you in the past that sort of the mix of revenue sources in that part of the business has changed, where it used to be that most every customer was being priced according to a two-year look back on premiums. But we're now at a point where more than 50% of what we do in RA is on multi-year agreements, not related at all to what was happening in the premiums two years prior.", "And then with respect to the rest of our customer base, where we still do reference premiums from two years before, just want to remind you that there are three terms in the pricing algorithm and premium is only one of the three. And we have complete freedom with respect to the other two, which is mill rate and the flat fees. And so the actual, literal effect of what is going on in the premium environment is actually very muted at this point. And it's really value-based pricing. It's the work that we do every year to try enhance and bring current what it is that we're providing to our customers. Our customers understand the value of that kind of work and it's really on that basis that we set the prices.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group", "Helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you so much. You had mentioned on the adjusted EBITDA margin when we take out the gain on sale of the third-party warrants, I think it was 47.4% for 2015, and then you said you were constructive on margins going forward. Does that mean you expect margins to go up in 2016 from that base?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "All right. What I tried to say was that I would caveat that positive just with the two adjustments I described. One, I mentioned the talent realignment. I kind of pointed to about 50 people, which would be some expense in Risk Assessment. We've talked about that over time. And the other thing I was just trying to call out was in first quarter of 2015, Argus had that revenue that was very high margins. It was about $11 million of project work. So I was trying to call out those two items in the context of what is a fundamentally sound and positive margin picture going forward.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just going back to Argus, you mentioned what the project revenue was in 1Q 2015. Can you give us that number 4Q 2014 just so we can see how the quarter you just reported compare?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I'm not sure we've provided that in the past. It's not \u2013 it's notable as first quarter. I don't think we've given that out in the past.

Maybe a little more insight on Infield and PCI Group in specialized markets and kind of the impact, how much that could possibly move the needle in 2016?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We haven't really put out the absolute size of those but I would just encourage you to think of both of those as modest tuck-ins.", "Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. All right. And obviously Argus is still doing well. Are you hearing anything else in the financial services vertical on demand in regards to macro? Or does that seem stable?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Actually, some of the fundamentals in the business are actually quite exciting. And one that I would point is the success that we're having in getting consortia of banks in end markets other than the United States to come into our method, and it's really very exciting because when that happens then we're essentially platformed in the market and now we can do \u2013 now we can bring the whole range of solutions that we've got. So we have several very exciting developments right now along those lines. But with respect to the macro environment, I mean, we've referenced it. I would encourage you to just understand. It's not really material as it relates to the prospects for the business going forward. No, it's kind of steady as she goes.", "Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay.", "Scott G.

I'm just wondering if that was a little bit stronger than you expected and that if that's just driven maybe by the consortia of banks or something else?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I would tell you that Argus is a wonderful business. I mean I just always like to mention that again. It has an incredible data asset that kind of creates a real barrier there and what the team there has been able to do is two things. One, provide great service and new products to those customers. And then we have the project revenue that is a little bit more related to the marketing and advertising effectiveness. We're trying to transition that to more subscription and I think we're being successful.", "So what we try to call out from an outlook perspective is that we continue to see very strong double digit growth and that is a growth even with or even kind of assuming the growth where that's going to happen in first quarter. So I felt we were trying to pretty transparent on that and hopefully that just clarifies the comments we made earlier.", "Zachary Bakal - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah. Thanks. I think we all appreciate that. And then just secondly on the Telematics Data Exchange, you know what we've been reading of that, it's getting prepared for say a June launch. We haven't really heard any additional partnerships aside from the one you already mentioned with OnStar and GM. Have you been able to build any additional partnerships? And will the program require any further partnerships to launch in June?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So in reverse order, we can start serving insurance companies even without additional OEMs in the partnership. One of the things you have to reference by the way is how advanced or not each OEM is with respect to the connected car movement. So some had gotten on with it more. Others less, GM has actually been a leader. That's one of the reasons why we were so excited about striking the partnership with them.", "But no, we can and will and are selling the data and the analytics into the insurance vertical beginning with the rollout of the platform. And as we add additional OEMs, the value just simply goes up, but we don't have to wait for that. And as you'd imagine, the team is out and having a lot of conversations with a lot of OEMs domestically and globally to promote the method. So this is a very \u2013 this is something we talk about very frequently inside of the management team, and we have great hopes for this and a lot of focus on this.", "Zachary Bakal - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "There's a lot of interest from us as well. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. You bet. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I think both of my questions have been answered, but I guess one piece I was hoping to maybe push a little bit more back to the WoodMac color, I know you're not giving any specific guidance, but I think the other businesses you have given at least directional color on how you're thinking about growth in 2016 versus 2015. So versus the 5%, is there any color that you can provide whether up or down from there, knowing that there's a wide range for positive?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I'm going to say it again. I said that it's going to grow, and I think we've been trying to be a little bit more transparent with regards to an outlook. I think that's as far as we're going to go at this point, and I hope you can respect that.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Then I think aerial imagery is an area you talk a lot about in the past, and we know you continue to innovate in a lot of parts of your business that don't necessarily get as much air time. I was wondering if there was any update on what you're up to there and the effect we can expect that to have on the insurance growth?", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So you may have noticed last year that we actually put out a press release that we were sourcing images again. And that's on our \u2013 based on our own efforts, but we're also working with others to source imagery. What makes it really special is the analysis that converts it into solutions that can be used by insurance companies and players and other industry verticals. And we are very, very happy with our methods, and we expect to see increasing commercial results in 2016 for what it is that we're doing. So yeah, it's an abiding part of what we're doing.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. You're welcome.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn it back over to you for closing remarks.", "Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest, and we are looking forward to being together with you again in about a quarter's time. And we certainly will have interesting updates for you at that point. So thanks very much, and enjoy your day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

This call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.", "David E. Cohen - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics", "Thank you, Shannon, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for discussion of our second quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the second quarter 2015 hedge gain and one-time costs related to the Wood Mackenzie acquisition.", "The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures which we'll reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, David, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4% including the impact of the shares we issued last year for the Wood Mac transaction.", "Year to date free cash flow is up 21%. Organic revenue growth was 5.4% as we continue to grow faster than our underlying end markets. We've spoken of higher longer term organic growth, and the underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins over 49%.", "We're focused on leveraging our Verisk distinctives which are, one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows and our core capabilities to add value for our customers and in turn for our shareholders. We're also seeing traction in new solutions that are being developed and continue to be optimistic about their long-term potential to contribute to customers and ultimately our financial performance.", "As we announced in June, I'm excited to have expanded the roles of several members of our senior leadership team. Mark Anquillare, who had been our CFO since before our 2009 IPO, is now Verisk's Chief Operating Officer with responsibility for our insurance businesses and our technology and customer experience organizations.", "Eva Huston is now our Chief Financial Officer responsible for financial strategy, including accounting, tax, treasury and investor relations. I'm also pleased to have appointed Nana Banerjee and Steve Halliday as group presidents. Nana leads Argus, Geomni and Verisk Retail. Steve leads Wood Mackenzie, 3E Company and Verisk Maplecroft.", "The strength of our platform and the clarity of our vision, combined with greater scope of responsibility for these four proven professionals, will support our growth agenda and global push into the near and long term. These are all natural evolutions from their previous roles and will help us continue to deliver value to our customers, employees and shareholders.", "During the quarter, we closed the sale of the healthcare business and used the proceeds to pay down our revolver, giving us plenty of capacity to support our long stated capital allocation strategy for a balanced approach over time to acquisitions and repurchases.", "We had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2016. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion. We also see M&A as a channel for expanding our solution footprint. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, you saw that we purchased Greentech Media, an industry leading information services provider for next-generation electricity and renewable sectors.", "Greentech Media joins Wood Mac, enhancing our research and other capabilities for subsectors, including solar generation, energy storage and smart grids that react dynamically to changes in supply and demand. These are very exciting areas in the energy and power markets and an excellent complement to our outstanding oil and gas franchise.", "I remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for growth both near and long term. We're excited about a number of early stage efforts where we are developing new and innovative solutions for our customers and where we are expanding existing solutions around the world. Near term, we continue to expect acceleration of our combined insurance businesses and double digit growth at Argus. Wood Mac is performing in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter.", "So, with that, let me turn it over to Mark for some additional comments.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have seen several key industry themes including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I will briefly describe a number of positive recent developments in our businesses.", "Reflecting on all three themes, Verisk Insurance Solutions launched a new integration option for 360Value, our web based replacement cost estimator for homeowner's insurance. 360Value is built on our unique and industry standard construction materials and labor cost data. This solution helps our customers estimate coverage limits for residential, commercial and agricultural properties. Our customers can now integrate 360Value directly into their online homeowners quoting platforms. This helps the industry deploy more engaging solutions which include pre-filling and online insurance application with property-specific information when a homeowner enters an address.", "Another recent launch is Mozart, a new product development platform increasing engagement in automation which helps our clients to easily research, create and distribute coverage language, providing efficiencies in time-to-market from new products and critical coverage updates. Mozart will help our customers accelerate profitable growth, reduce expense ratios and enhance audit and compliance.", "Leveraging big data methods, cutting edge technology and pioneering automation, AIR released a hosted cloud solution for its catastrophe risk management platforms, Touchstone and CATRADER. More than a dozen companies are already up and running on the AIR cloud, which enables them to conduct all of their analyses remotely while minimizing capital expenditures.", "Finally, in addition to the new deployment option, AIR recently expanded its coverage model of Southeast Asia. These models combine 10 years of extensive scientific research by AIR scientists with findings from studies of local building codes, damage surveys, lost experience data and structural engineering research.", "With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Mark. In the second quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth going forward. Revenue grew 16.3% and 5.4% organically. EBITDA grew 12.4% to $245 million. EBITDA margins were 49.2% in the quarter. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 23.5% and 5.5% organically.", "Financial services was the fastest-growing organic revenue end market while insurance focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 6.2% in the second quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in loss quantification and claims analytics solutions. Underwriting solutions also grew in the quarter. Our catastrophe modeling solutions saw a modest decline versus the prior year as a result of lower cat bond issuance and consulting revenues. Customer retention remains very high, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth.", "Financial services revenue returned to strong growth, up 15.9% in the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the contributions from the media effectiveness solutions, which grew very well in the quarter. Our international revenue continues to grow nicely here as well, which does mean that FX may influence the reported results throughout the rest of the year. As Scott noted, we remain comfortable with double digit growth based on accelerating growth in the second half of the year.", "Energy and specialized markets revenue grew 70.4% including Wood Mac, which was acquired in May 2015. In this year's second quarter, Wood Mac revenue was around flat on a constant currency basis. The decline in the British pound late in Q2 will have a larger effect on reported results starting in Q3 as the average Q2 rate was $1.43 and is currently in the low $1.30s. Organic revenue excluding Wood Mac, PCI and Infield declined $2.4 million in the quarter.", "Services revenue peaked in the prior year as customers met 2015 compliance deadlines. We are also transitioning to a subscription revenue model, which is better for Verisk and better for our customers over the long term. The dollar impact remains small in relation to Verisk as a whole. Finally as a reminder, Wood Mac is organic starting in Q3.", "Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.5% and 5.3% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Additionally, contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland, added growth.", "Industry standard insurance programs revenue grew 6.0%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue.", "EBITDA increased 12.4% in the quarter to $245 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 49.2%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 20.8% to $141 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses.", "EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 2.9% to $105 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset in part by talent realignment initiatives we have been discussing with you. This resulted in moderated margins versus Q1 as the hiring started to take effect, as well as the impact of our annual merit increases. We are very excited about the additions we've made to the team, and we look forward to their contributions over time.", "Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at June 30, 2016, after our repayments facilitated by cash flow generation and the proceeds from the sale of the healthcare business. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 2.2 times pro forma for the healthcare divestiture, and we are pleased to have reached our target ahead of plan. We appreciate the support and confidence of our debt holders as we acquired Wood Mac with the goal of returning to the 2.5 times steady-state leverage. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.5%.", "Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 3.7% to $124 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.73 in the quarter, an increase of 1.4%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations both organic and acquired and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation and amortization, only a partial quarter of Wood Mac ownership in the prior period and an increase in shares outstanding related to the 2015 acquisition of Wood Mac. We expect that our adjusted EPS growth will normalize over time to reflect similar trends you see in our underlying business results.", "The average diluted share count was 171.2 million shares in the quarter. And on June 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to balance our appetite for share repurchase with our desire to maintain flexibility for M&A. At June 30, 2016, we had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital.", "Free cash flow increased 21.1% for the six month period to $305 million including Wood Mac. This represented 61.9% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of Wood Mac.", "Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and therefore shareholder value. Capital expenditures increased 4.6% to $52 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2016, due to the inclusion of Wood Mac's CapEx for the full quarter.", "CapEx was 5.2% of revenue. We expect CapEx for the full year to be $150 million to $155 million pro forma for the divestiture of the healthcare business. We continue to manage our capital intensity to enable free cash flow growth.", "As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operations basis, we expect that based on current FX rates, there's about a $25 million impact to full year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of 2016. This is up from our estimate last quarter of a $10 million impact. FX is a new factor as you think about our future growth, and we will look to provide more insight going forward to help you include it in your forecasting.", "As you think about Q3, keep in mind that last year, EBITDA included a $15.6 million warrant sale gain which will not recur this year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a one-time P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO which will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time.", "For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. We know these are items that are hard to project, which is why we share them with you each quarter.", "Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense after paying down the revolver with the divestiture proceeds to be around $120 million. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible and amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rate that's applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases.", "Overall, we are working hard to execute on our 2016 plan and remain excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We're well positioned for profitable growth in the future and have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for continued long-term growth. We continue to appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.", "And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the cat modeling business. I guess, one, can you give us any sense in terms of the magnitude of the impact from the consulting and cat bonds or I guess how big those are relative to the size of the cat modeling business? And just trying to get a sense of the underlying trend in that cat modeling business versus the trends you have been seeing.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Great. Hey, Tim. It's Eva. Thanks for the question. Maybe just starting at a high level, cat bonds and consulting are less than 5% of overall Decision Analytics insurance revenue. Obviously for AIR, those would be a greater percentage. But if you were to peel back the onion and look at AIR's performance, the underlying subscription business is performing very well. We're very happy with our position in the market. And with regards to cat bonds, we continue to win and we have strong market share. There's just some variability that can happen across periods in some of those revenues that are non-subscription.", "Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then the comment about accelerating growth in the insurance vertical this year, it seems to imply you would need pretty strong performance in the second half of the year. I guess, can you just tell us, make sure I guess, tell us what you are assuming there? And I guess, just to be clear, is that I guess inclusive or exclusive of the kind of true-up revenue that you had in the first quarter?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Scott, here. We'll come back to that true-up question. But the way that we observe our business, Tim, it's always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewal opportunities or new business opportunities. So, it's very much a bottoms-up view.", "If I look across the insurance vertical, it's pretty broadly based in terms of our expectations for the latter half of the year. I wouldn't say that any one theme really stands out. We called out that in this quarter some of the transaction based business around the cat modeling space were soft. But overall, as we look at the latter half of 2016, it's really pretty broadly based across claims, underwriting, industry standard solutions and catastrophe modeling.", "One perspective I thought I might just add here is, if you just think about the kind of the world in which Verisk sits at the moment, and you think about really exogenous factors, there's really three things that are kind of out there that are just sort of bubbling at the moment, probably in order of importance when you think about Verisk outcomes overall.", "One would be that our customers in the oil and gas industry are under a lot of pressure at the moment because of where the commodity stands. We think that that's a moment-in-time effect. We don't predict the oil price, but we expect a more normalized environment.", "The second is that there hasn't been a lot of extreme event activity over the last couple of years and that really tends to have two effects. Now I'm in the insurance vertical. That tends to have two effects. One is the reinsurance world has softened. The pricing has softened, and there has been some consolidation, and so that works its way in little bit. And then cat bond issuance has actually responded to that as well, the lack of extreme events. And as Eva said, we continue to get the overwhelming share of the cat bond activity. It's just that the absolute volumes have turned down there.", "We get asked a lot, by the way, whether overall premium progression in the insurance industry tends to affect us, and the answer is basically no because of the way that we contract with our customers. But when there is a sustained period of less extreme events activity, it actually it shows up a little bit because the underlying markets respond to that. And also, a few of the things that we do like repair cost estimating, there is an element of it which responds to the absolute number of claims. And when you have extreme events, you have more claims.", "And then the third thing is, as Eva was pointing out in 2015, a lot of our environmental health and safety customers needed to really scramble to make sure that they were compliant with regulations that required compliance by the end of 2015. So, there was a bit of surge of work in that regard.", "So you have kind of a moment-in-time effect which is that was kind of powering the business up to 2015. That is also a part of the business where when you look at subscription-based revenues, we're actually happy with what's happening.", "So, I just thought I would throw out that perspective overall in the sense that, on the one hand, I don't really think our business is that affected by what's happening in the outside world, but it's not as if we're totally immune. And probably, all the dials are pointed in the wrong direction just at this moment, and yet the performance of our company is good. I'm really happy with it. So then, Mark, did you want to just take on the?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer", "So, just to kind of follow up on the question you had from a DA perspective, that growth would be with and without the true-up adjustment. Just to kind of reiterate Scott said, I mean we're feeling pretty good and confident because of what I refer to as contracts that are signed and waiting for implementation, so those do kick in in the second half.", "Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "In Wood Mac, so good to see that the trend was largely as you expected. Any reason to think that that changes in one direction or another in the back half of the year based on what you're seeing from client demand?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No. No. The retention rates on the subscription based part of the business remain very strong. And actually, the services side of the business actually had some very nice wins in the last couple of months. So no, we don't anticipate any changes.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. And then turning to margins, as we think about margin trends for the two segments, you had talked before about plans for increased hiring in Risk Assessment and it looks like we saw that come through in this quarter. Are we now at a stable run rate for cost in that segment or is there further ramp in the cost base to come? And if you could help us think about various factors impacting the margin trends for Decision Analytics in the back half of the year as well, that would be great. Thanks.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So let me just make a general comment and then, Eva, maybe you want to take it on a little more specifically. One of the decisions that you get to make when you are in the position we are of leading a company like Verisk is, when you're aware of kind of the macro environment and modest waxing and waning in terms of revenues in any particular moment, the question you get to ask yourself is what is your confidence in the business. Are you going to continue to invest? And we're very confident in this business. And so we have continued to invest knowing that at this moment in time, we have the kinds of just macro factors that I talked about before.", "Specifically with respect to ISO solutions, we are very interested in amplifying what it is that we do there. And so the kind of talent that we brought in with respect to topics like \u2013 and all of these relate to the insurance world, cyber, Internet of Things, the linkage between the energy ecosystem and the insurance world, et cetera \u2013 we've really created a substantially new talent base that we just didn't have before. Also resilience issues as they relate to extreme events, and I could go on.", "We're excited to have this new talents inside of the organization. And so our judgment is that the best thing to do is to keep investing inside of our company and to do it on a consistent sort of a basis, which is where we are right at the moment. Did you want to add anything to that, Eva?", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah so, Sara, just to take on your specific questions around margin, I mean I think Scott's elaborated on the talent realignment, and there is impact there as well. Don't lose sight of our usual annual merit increases that go in in the second quarter, a common occurrence and does have impact on margin in 2Q. I think if you look back historically, you would see that as well.", "With regards to Decision Analytics, one, I would just point out that the non-subs revenue that we've been talking about a bit, actually unlike some of the historical transactional revenue that we used to have in businesses we no longer own, that's actually pretty high margin business. And so when we don't have that come through, that can have some impact on the margin in the moment. I would also point out to you, I mentioned in my comments FX, and FX can have some impact on margin as well. Revenue and expense, we try to have those mostly aligned, but they're not always perfectly aligned.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Scott, I definitely heard the second half acceleration for insurance which is expected. I just wanted to know quantitatively if we're still looking for Verisk to see each RA and DA insurance accelerate for the full year 2016 from the 2015 rates which were 6% and 8%.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Most of the lift in terms of the growth rate is going to come on the DA side.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "I appreciate you taking my question. Hey. Mark, the color on some of those new products is helpful. I wonder if you can elaborate again as a follow-up to Andrew Steinerman's question, specifically within DA, is do we see some of those new products making a meaningful contribution in the back half or is this sort of just the natural motion of continued share gain and pricing to value and so forth?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer", "So, the short answer is I think these will become more meaningful as we think about 2017 and beyond. But as I highlighted, we have some AIR customers that are on the cloud and moving quickly. So it does help 2016 back half, but I would think these are a little bit more longer term in the way I think and outline the business for the future.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And are there any other callouts? I know underwriting is sort of one of your burgeoning areas, or is as you indicated in the second quarter, the growth sort of pretty evenly distributed across your solution sets? And again, I'm thinking about insurance DA.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer", "Once again I'll just, I'll echo Scott. I mean it's broad-based. I think we feel good about most areas of the business with regard to growth in the second half relative to the first. And there's a couple areas where we actually are having customers transition to our solutions. And that just sometimes takes a little more time than you anticipate, whether it's volumes coming through or the volumes you expect coming through. Although you have signed contracts that you know there's a commitment over time, we want to go as fast as we can, and we have to work with our customers to do that.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, so maybe a little bit of timing to consider in the second quarter too then?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer", "All true.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. Just to start off. In terms of Wood Mac, I know in the past you talked about how you thought it was undersold. I was just wondering if you have any updates there on progress you've made on that front.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah so, the sort of the selling of Wood Mac really you can think of it as being in two different buckets. So one of those is to cross-sell and up-sell inside of our existing customer set which is order of magnitude 1,000 customers. And we give a lot of attention to whether we're right-sized there. Obviously, we're trying to pick our spots at the moment because of just the overall environment. But that is a team that is strong and getting stronger. We actually have new leadership of the sales team there and very excited about Lynda's leadership for us.", "And then secondly, there is how do we go from 1,000 to say 5,000 or more kinds of customers. And that in part hinges upon opening up new channels for distributing our content. And we have one new such relationship in place and are working hard to get others in place. So, I think that it's a good feeling into the future and kind of there are some early shoots with respect to these new channels.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you for that. And I guess next question is kind of staying on the Wood Mac topic. Just given that I guess last year in the second of half of the year was when Wood Mac started to become sort of challenging, and given that earlier in this call, you mentioned that even on the services side, you're starting to see more of a pick-up. Is there any reason not to expect there to be positive momentum in the second half of the year given those dynamics?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we're sticking by what we said before which is our view of 2016 overall is essentially flat relative to 2015 and there are puts and takes with respect to the different lines of business that Wood Mac does. And then of course, there's always the X factor of just the macro environment overall. And so we're pretty comfortable with where we're at. But I would like to say as I said also last quarter, I think the performance of our Wood Mac colleagues is absolutely outstanding in light of something which is tsunami-like inside of their end market. I mean, I think the quality of what Wood Mac does and the depth of relationship with customers is actually demonstrated so strongly in this moment actually. So we expect a normalized environment. We want our customers to feel less pressured than they do today, and when they do, I'm absolutely certainly that it will be reflected in our performance.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much for the answers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Good morning. Can you just give us an update on where you are in terms of aerial imagery image capture as well as productizing the broader aerial imagery capabilities?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, one of our favorite topics. So we have at the moment basically two different ways that we give ourselves access to images today. One is our own efforts to source images and the other is working with third parties who have been sourcing images for their own purposes. That mix I would say is working, and has helped us to take all of the great image analytics technology that we've got and basically make that more active, particularly in the insurance vertical today. That's really where it's happening today. And we continue to ask questions about how we can be more in control of a larger set of images that are optimized for the use cases that we have in mind and we're working actively on that right now. So the report, Jeff, would be that commercially we're succeeding with what we're doing in the imaging space and we continue to think deeply about additional things that would help us to be more in control of a larger set of images.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "When you say commercially succeeding, do you have the image library and gathering apparatus necessary that you're at the point where you're productizing and selling to clients?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Correct.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And then, just maybe a comment on the Wood Mac M&A pipeline. There's been a few smaller deals, so I guess just any comment on how much of the activity is you putting more capital behind Wood Mac than they were getting under their prior ownership. How much is it more opportunity in the market because of what's going on in the end market? And then just any, what's your appetite for a potentially larger deal for Wood Mac?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Yeah. So, let me just step through to that real quick. So, part of what we've done on the M&A front has been what I would consider to be small and tuck-in and really about trying to give ourselves additional distinctive data assets. That for example was the Infield acquisition. So that's sort of point one. The second point I would make is that we're very excited about Greentech Media because of the depth of expertise there with respect to solar and smart grids and grid edge technologies and storage technologies.", "And what we're finding is that our existing hydrocarbon-based customers are increasingly interested in the alternatives. And so, not only is it in a sense new business for us, the degree to which we're now looking specifically at the dynamics of what's going on in solar generation, specifically in terms of what's going on with respect to grid edge effects, not only is it new business, but it also actually makes us a more compelling partner for our existing customers in the hydrocarbon ecosystem. So, we are really excited about it. We think that it's really going to be helpful.", "And then I think overall, you were just kind of looking for what's the forward profile. Well, I'd make a couple comments. One is, there have been some very large trades in the oil and gas space. And we didn't participate as you saw. And we continue to ask questions about what strategically would advantage this business the most. But we're certainly not enamored of the thought of large deals. And a lot of it is, we're going to make the business that we have run well. I think that again, kind of around the edges, we will try to support that which we already do. And there will be opportunities that are kind of thematic in the way that say Greentech is thematic.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you, Scott.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning everyone.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So, first congratulations to Mark and to Eva on the promotion.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Bill.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So first question for the new CFO, you've hit your leverage target, exceeded it, 2.5 is what you had set back when you had purchased Wood Mac, you're at 2.2 times. Going forward, what's that new leverage target? It had been 2.5, but that seemed like more of a combination temporarily. Is it more like 3 times?", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Bill, I would say that our leverage target steady-state remains 2.5 times. But remember how we've always operated, is we have flexibility to go above that. We did with. We said we'd delever. I think that we have a leverage point that our business can very easily support. I think that we always just look at the opportunities and figure out where we need to settle that. But I think the good news for us is we've got capacity under even at steady-state and the flexibility to go up as warranted if there's a deal that makes sense for us.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. And then a second question for you on the insurance business and Decision Analytics. If you could talk a little bit about Xactware, XactContents and the blend of the subscription and transaction business and then also how the new 360Value product fits in with that whole category.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah so, Bill, maybe I'll take the second part first, then I'll let Mark talk a little bit about some of the specific products in insurance and solutions. If you were to think about Decision Analytics overall, the mix between subscription and non-subscription, it's about 77% subscription. I would say insurance in Decision Analytics looks fairly similar to the rest of Decision Analytics now, now that we don't have that highly transactional business in healthcare in there anymore. There's more uniformity across that. So, I think that we love where we sit. We've always thought it was natural to have someone out of non-subscription revenue, and I think in Decision Analytics, we have a bit more of that, and that includes things we do that provide us opportunities to work closely with customers and develop those new solutions. I'll let Mark comment a bit on Xactware and some of the other solutions.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And the 360 innovations.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer", "Sure. So let me just quickly highlight the fact that we continue to improve the suite of Xactware solutions. Our vision and our focus for this year and next is to bring out what I'll refer to as a more integrated solution which brings together Xactimate that's used in probably about 85% of the property repair cost estimates across the United States in combination with XactAnalysis which is the BI tool and everything around it so that you can work and use your back office in an efficient way. In addition, Contents, which represents all of the information about pricing and materials inside the home to replace the TV, couches, rugs and things.", "So our focus, make it more integrated, easier to use, more focus on the claim as opposed to the assignment, which was doing the work but more on the claim. All of that has been kind of a focus from a customer perspective and our perspective to achieve those things. Very much in our forward vision is to take that solution, that more simplified solution and bring it to the global insurance market, customizing it in a way that it is fit for use in that market and we've put a lot of time and resource and are making progress there.", "The final component to this is we are seeing a lot of activity in the US market where people are interested in trying to make access to the quote engine, going online and getting a quote for auto and home, more and more interactive with the customer. And our ability to help our customers do that through the enhancement here at 360Value, lets you as a homeowner go online to make sure you have the proper coverage for your home. That's valuable, that's helpful and it's easy. You have the policyholder, or the person who's getting the quote do it himself and that's the type of innovation we want to work with and help our customers with their customers.", "Last piece as we think about this bringing it together, we are finding increased interest in basically the whole property suite of solutions as we go overseas. So we kind of led in with the claims side of things, but clearly people are looking for information about large commercial buildings. So, replicating some of the things we do here in the United States, using both remote sensing and aerial images, providing with insights into risk about a building and help him understand what the insurance to value is, meaning what's the replacement cost if there was a total loss. And all of those themes, I think we are trying to be more comprehensive, more seamless, both internationally and that will obviously revert back with our US customers as well. So I probably said a lot, but I want to make sure I responded to some of the questions then.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Well, thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Good morning, would appreciate your thoughts more broadly on capital allocation, Scott, especially since you've reached the target leverage ratio or even below it, ahead of schedule. Post the sale of healthcare, you have more subscription revenue, more visibility on cash flow. You indicated a preference for small tuck-in data-oriented acquisitions. I guess two questions. First, how do you think about opportunities in the acquisition pipeline versus share repurchase given the current price of your stock? And then secondly, with the higher subscription based revenue, more visible cash flow, higher margin profile, how do you think about the possibility of initiating a dividend?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean all good, all good topics. So, maybe back to the top. If you look at our company over extended periods of time, the program of acquisition and the share repurchase program have both done very well for our shareholders, both have done very well. And there's really nothing in our situation that would cause us to think that anything fundamentally is going to be different in the future than in the past. You actually pointed out one of the features of our company, which is that the cash flow visibility is, if anything, even greater than it was. So we would continue to see both of those as real pillars inside of the way that we do what we do.", "And so at any given moment, this moment for example, we're always taking stock of where we stand in the M&A pipeline and how imminent we think good opportunities are. And we remain very interested in deploying capital in terms of returning it to shareholders when we feel that sort of that which is right at the head of the pipeline and the size is such that we still have capacity. And I would say that we do have, we have capacity as we sit here. So we're very alert to the application of capital and we'll remain so and that's a statement for the third quarter and the fourth quarter and really forever.", "I actually thought your second question, David, was going to be different, more about sort of a higher leverage target rather than a dividend. We're very interested in returning capital to shareholders I guess that's the way that I would put it. Our analysis to date has not indicated that there's anything fundamentally superior about doing it in the form of a dividend versus the buyback program that we've had. So, that's kind of where we sit with that thought at the moment.", "By the way, even David and I and Mark and all of us that are out there talking to investors, we actually ask that question all the time, how do you feel about it. And so we remain open to the conversation, but I would say that we haven't drawn the conclusion that a dividend is a superior way of expressing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI", "Understood. Thanks so much for the insights.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I was hoping you could give a little more color on the pieces within specialized excluding Wood Mac. Were there parts of the business that did well this quarter? And basically, where were the sort of the troubled areas; where were the bright spots?", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, Toni, I'll kick off on that and Scott may want to add some comments. I think if you take Wood Mac, PCI and Infield out of specialized because those are all inorganic in the quarter, you primarily have our environmental health and safety solutions and some of our weather solutions. We referenced in the press release and on the call, when you think about EH&S, there were some global standards that went into place in 2015 which gave us the opportunity to serve our customers in making those transitions. Those transitions are complete and so you'll kind of see a normalization of that type of work this year which is leading to the organic result of a decline there. I would say that that's probably the primary impact.", "And if you were to think about it, I think the headline growth decline as a percentage is larger than the actual dollar impact on Verisk. The other thing we mentioned is with regards to that area, we are transitioning into more subscription based revenues. And I think that's really great both for us and for our customers. So in a moment in time, if you're going from more transactional to more subscription, the great thing about subscription is it's recognized over time but in the moment, transaction is not there and subscription is only the portion of what you're going to recognize, you're going to see a little impact.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We've actually observed on this before, but just a little sort of data analytic observation is that when you start out with a new solution, both customers and the vendors often want it to be transaction priced, because nobody really knows the absolute level of demand. There really do come these moments where the customers are open to, and maybe even wanting to move to a subscription, because they want more certainty and visibility in terms of the future. So, it's a kind of a natural sort of a development for newer kinds of solutions. And Eva was describing that with respect to some of which goes on on the EH&S side. Same thing on the country and political risk side, we're doing the same thing.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. And then looking at financial, the comps get a lot easier in the back half of the year. I think you've previously talked about double digits in that segment for the full year. What would be the difference between getting to low double digits versus mid teens? Would it be project revenue? You mentioned the media effectiveness grew nicely this quarter. And how's the transition going from sort of project revenue to subscription in that business?", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Toni, I would just start by saying as a reminder, when we talk about double digits, we're actually including the grow over impact of that one-time media effectiveness revenue we had in 2015 in the first quarter. So I actually think the target we set is pretty ambitious. If you consider that we're not taking that out in that analysis. I would say that like many of our businesses, I think there's opportunity for us to add incremental revenue through project revenue. And certainly, that's something that you can move, that could move a growth rate in a short term. But I think fundamentally, when we talk about the double digit growth rate, again given the comparable that we have for last year, we think that that is very strong.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, and I'll just add that there are some sparkling new names on the customer list even this quarter. I mean, this business is doing a wonderful job of reaching out to new customer sets.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks a lot.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Pease go ahead.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks so much. I know it's late. I just have a quick question. Eva, you had mentioned the potential $25 million impact from FX for the year. Can you give us a little bit more color exactly which line items from a revenue perspective we might see the biggest impact? Thanks.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure, absolutely. I mean obviously Wood Mac has the most of the pound-based revenue which is the rate we're referencing, although we do have other currencies in there as well. I would say that we have international revenue in our financial services, as I mentioned. We have some of that in EH&S. I mean we have a little bit now in insurance as well. And so most of it would be in Wood Mac, but I think it is actually scattered across the company. And as we go forward, I think one of the things that's been on my mind is, I think we will continue to try to provide you more visibility into that, because my sense is that to date, your inclusion of that impact in our forward-looking expectations that you develop has been a little more soft as opposed to direct. And so we'll try to help you with that.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "All right. That would be appreciated. Thanks so much.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. So, my question is just on the longer term margin profile of the business. It sounded like obviously there's some macro issues and some issues within the insurance vertical in general that are kind of, I wouldn't call them one-time, but are ebbs and flows of the business. and you're taking the opportunity here to add resources and to maybe bulk up on some of your new offerings. So how should we think about the longer term margin profile of the business? Is this a short term thing, and if those macro factors turn in your favor, will you kind of pull back on that or is this something that's in place until those new businesses kick in? How should we think about it? Thanks.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, well maybe just starting with long term because as we think about long term, that's over multiple years. I don't know when you're saying that and you're referencing the quarter, it almost sounds to me like you're referring more to a shorter long term than we would. But what I would say is I think we continue to be constructive on margins over the long term. Our business is that build it once, sell it many times. As I did observe in the quarter in particular, when you have some high margin non-subscription business like cat bonds and you have lots of that, that will have a moment-in-time impact on the margin in the quarter. But that being said, I think over the long term, nothing has changed in our outlook for what we can do there and the opportunity to expand margins over time.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. Let me echo the congratulations on your respective promotions. I'll just ask my two questions up front. And you sort of addressed them in your prior three responses, Eva, but I just want to make sure I had this right. The transition to subscription in Wood Mac, how should we sort of dimensionalize the revenue impact? That's the first one, the subscription in Wood Mac. And the second one is, were there any project based revenues in the Q2 related to financial services? Thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah so, just on the first question, a clarification. When you're talking about transition to subscription revenue, that was referencing ex-Wood Mac in energy and specialized, so that was really more around our EH&S solutions.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, in country and political risk.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Country and political. So, that was not a Wood Mac related comment. With regards to project revenue in financial services, I mean we always have some. I would say there was nothing in particular that we would call out in the quarter.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And that's not the dominant theme in terms of what's going on. The growth in financial services is very broadly based. It's new geographies. It's the traditional subscription revenues. It's analytic product. It's the whole mix.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you, Scott. Thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time. I would return the call to the presenters.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, just wanted to say thank you all very much for your interest today and all the good questions. And I know we'll be seeing some of you in the relatively near future and look forward to that.

In the third quarter, we delivered solid overall results with total and organic constant currency revenue growth of around 6% as we continue to grow faster than our end markets. With almost 8% growth from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging.

Year-to-date free cash flow is up 13% excluding the tax on the gain from the healthcare business sale.", "We were pleased to resume returning capital to our shareholders through our longstanding share repurchase program. We bought $73 million of stock in the quarter and we had $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2016.", "With our leverage back below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity for strategically relevant tuck-in acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions in particular as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement.", "Analyze Re is a great example where we found a high performance analytics capability that complements the Touchstone platform at AIR. While the deal only closed last week, the teams are already working on integration and go-to-market strategies. We continue to make progress enhancing the Verisk distinctives of one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows. Consistent with our efforts, Verisk was recently ranked in the top 20 on Forbes magazine's 2016 list of the world's most innovative companies.", "Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, including those who have joined us relatively recently. And I'm very encouraged by the growing enthusiasm across the company to serve our customers with innovative data analytic solutions. We see a direct relationship between the excellence of our employees and their commitment to creating innovative solutions for our customers.", "We remain confident in our double-digit growth forecast for financial services this year, and we still continue to expect WoodMac to be around flat in constant currency. In pursuit of our goal of insurance growth above the 2015 run rate, we are pleased with new contract signings and the performance of several newer, more innovative solutions. As you know, there's been some softness in the reinsurance market, and 2016 has been an extremely quiet storm season.", "In addition, a handful of customers have signed contracts as expected, but the related implementations are starting a bit later than originally planned. While timing is a factor as we cross the 2016 finish line, we continue to feel very good about the quality of our data assets. Our customers' regard for us is higher than ever according to our NPS methodology, and the long-term outlook is for continued revenue growth.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark who will make some additional comments.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we had several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation, and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll highlight a number of positive recent developments.", "In the vertical big data area, we launched a new energy insurance group focused on transforming risk assessment, rating, and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation, and metals and mining industries. The group is drawing on deep domain expertise and proprietary data from our ISO, AIR and WoodMac businesses. The data analytic solutions will help global property and casualty insurers evaluate and select risk and manage portfolios based upon energy and insurance industry-wide data, rather than relying solely on their own experience, data sets and tools. We're uniquely positioned to be the first to market at innovating the intersection of insurance and energy sectors.", "One of our industry automation solutions saw a win as a leading insurer expanded use of A-PLUS, Verisk's Loss History solution, to conduct loss history evaluations at the beginning rather than the after the quote process. This change of workflow will enhance the experience of their customers while improving operational and sales efficiencies. Improving conversion rates through better customer experiences while keeping expenses flat and maintaining underwriting integrity is a forward-thinking, innovative approach to profitable growth.", "We continue to perform well in the cat modeling space. As an example, we're very pleased when a leading global player decided to select AIR's Touchstone platform as its primary modeling solution along with the complete suite of AIR's global catastrophe models. Their decision was informed by, in their words, AIR's detailed loss modeling capabilities and superior service. This follows the June 2016 release of Touchstone 4.0 which features a variety of enhancements designed to improve performance, workflow automation and efficiency, and the overall user experience.", "Finally, we continue to improve digital engagement in the P&C industry through the availability of Circular Authority for Insurance. This is a cloud-based analytic solution designed to help insurers better manage ISO content with tools to visualize, compare and analyze updates. The solution helps insurers plan, implement and track our filings with state regulators and stay informed on the latest insurance topics. This is a natural extension to the thousands of insurance program updates we issue each year, and we're confident that it will add value and functionality for our customers.", "With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks, Mark. In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth in the future. Revenue grew 5.9% and 6.2% on an organic constant currency basis. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 5.9% to $250 million. This growth excludes the prior period gain on sale of warrants. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter.", "Within Decision Analytics, revenue grew 6.2% and 6.9% on an organic constant currency basis. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest growing vertical, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7.4% in the third quarter. We saw solid growth in underwriting, claims analytics and catastrophe modeling solutions. Loss quantification solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth.", "Financial services revenue increased 24.5% in the quarter, led by growth in analytical solutions and media effectiveness. We are seeing good interest in the solutions we are building with our partners and continue to believe that our differentiated data assets position us well to execute on our plans in this vertical. As reported, energy and specialized markets revenue was about flat. The continuing weakness in the British pound remains a headwind to both revenue growth and Decision Analytics margins on a reported basis.", "Consistent with our longstanding approach, WoodMac became a part of organic growth starting in the third quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes PCI, Infield, Greentech and Quest, declined $5.3 million in the quarter, but increased slightly excluding the impact of FX.", "Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.3% and 5% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our longstanding insurance customers. Contributions in new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland.", "Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.4% reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as Predictive Model and Electronic Rating Content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue.", "EBITDA decreased 0.6% in the quarter to $253 million resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.9%. EBITDA growth adjusted for the 2015 gain on sale of warrants was 5.9%. EBITDA excludes a third quarter 2016 severance charge as we combined administrative functions following the WoodMac integration. It also excludes a gain on an investment in a company which was acquired by a third party.", "Decision Analytics EBITDA excluding the prior year gain grew 7.3% to $147 million in the quarter. Decision Analytics EBITDA as reported decreased 3.7%. EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 4% to $106 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management offset by increased staff levels following the previously announced talent realignment.", "Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at September 30, 2016. After using our proceeds from the healthcare divestiture to pay down debt, our pro forma leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.2 times, below our 2.5 times reference level.", "Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. We saw a one-time benefit in the quarter from a change in the tax rates in the UK. Adjusted net income in 3Q increased 8.1% to $144 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.84 in the quarter, an increase of 7.7%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations, both organic and acquired, lower interest expense, and lower taxes. The increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, and the 2015 warrant sale gain which did not recur this year. Excluding the 2015 warrant gain, adjusted EPS grew 16.9%.", "The average diluted share count was 171.8 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171 million shares. We repurchased 900,000 shares at an average price of $81.72 for a total cost of $73 million in the quarter. At September 30, we had about $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital.", "Free cash flow increased 12.8% to $429 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, excluding the $75 million tax on the gain of the sale of the healthcare business. Free cash flow excluding the tax was 57.4% of EBITDA. These numbers are all from continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses, the addition of WoodMac, and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value.", "Capital expenditures increased 0.8% to $88 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, and we continue to balance the capital intensity of the business with investing for future growth. CapEx was 5.9% of revenue year-to-date. We expect for the full year, our CapEx will be about $10 million lower than we previously discussed as we manage efficiencies across our hardware and software spend even while developing more software for solution delivery.", "As you think about your models for the remainder of 2016 on a continuing operations basis, please remember that in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a one-time P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a non-recurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO and will exclude \u2013 be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. This is really the final item that will be associated with ESOP adjustments.", "For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx from continuing operations of $140 million to $145 million, fixed asset depreciation/amortization of about $125 million, and the amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $120 million for the full year, and we estimate the tax rate to be around 31% for the full year.", "For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rates applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a full-year diluted weighted average share count of about 171.6 million shares before incremental repurchases.", "We are executing on our 2016 plan despite larger than expected currency headwinds and are actively engaged in planning for the future. We're excited about the opportunities we see for profitable growth and remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term.", "We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.", "And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Hey.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Scott, you mentioned the softness in the reinsurance market does this impact your ability to grow insurance this year over last year or are you still confident that you'll be able to achieve that and could you just remind us of your exposure to reinsurance?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. So, our goal remains the same and I did mention it just because it is a factor in the environment right now. Our exposure to reinsurance is primarily with respect to the work that we do in the cat modeling world, not exclusively. We also provide some loss distribution content to the global reinsurers, but it's principally through catastrophe modeling and basically and I'm actually mention two things that are in the environment right now, the other is it's a very quiet storm season and in fact, it has been a quiet storm season for the last several years. And that does interact with the way that the reinsurance market behaves. And so, there have been some combinations in the reinsurance world including the brokers.", "And so, you have that in the environment. So, it's in there. It's a factor but the business \u2013 our insurance business overall is really good. And even yesterday, we had a visit from folks from an extremely prominent global non-domestic insurance organization and they were essentially asking, how could they get closer to more of our solutions. I think it's a conversation that we were probably not going to be able to have even just a couple of years ago. So, that's kind of where we sit right now.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's great. And my follow-up is just on the expense side. You had a really strong quarter specifically referring to the 63% gross margin in DA. Just \u2013 was anything one-time in there? How sustainable is that? And just overall when we think about EBITDA margins of 51%, it's obviously extremely strong. So, what do you view as may the key areas to move margins higher, not that we're complaining? But, or are you focused on keeping margins flat and just plowing scale benefits or any sort of additional expense benefits into supporting future growth?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So, you had a couple of questions in there. So, the first one, there was really nothing one-time in the results. And in fact, we're trying to kind of help you see that there were actually some one \u2013 there were some one-time effects in 2015. So, but no, nothing with respect to 2016. And it's really the same story that it's always been which is that there is definitely scale just built into the way we do what we do.", "And the offset is the investment in new things and we're actually just completing our annual refresh of our five-year plans. And I think we have the most robust new solution pipeline that we've ever had, actually. So, we're excited to be investing in the business, and that is the one offsetting factor. But the business continues to demonstrate the same scale effects as it always has. So, we've said we're constructive on margins in the intermediate and long term, and we're still in that place.", "Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Terrific. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh, William Blair & Company. Your line is open.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks. First, just on the energy and specialized markets. Can you \u2013 the organic growth that you mentioned was slightly positive on a constant currency basis?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Correct.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Can you help us think about the legacy part of that segment versus Wood Mackenzie and how that contributed to that performance?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. Tim, it's Eva. Good morning. I think, if you think about the business, I mean, as you said, we have the legacy, we have the environmental health and safety, and some of our (20:35) analytics solution. And I think some of the comments we made last quarter would be reflected in the performance there. We had a grow-over from last year and some global regulations that went in place in the H&S, and that will sort of continue to be an impact on the growth you see this year.", "And then with regards to WoodMackenzie, what we've talked about is, for the year, we expect about flat growth on a constant currency basis. And we're tracking towards that. We feel good about the performance of the business there. And I would say sort of by degrees, I think, the third quarter, some of the renewals we've been seeing are positive signs, I would say, that the market continues to be in the state it's in, and so I wouldn't overweight that. But I would say that we're pleased with the performance at WoodMackenzie.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, on insurance, I guess, not to, to follow-up on it. To get to a faster growth this year than you had last year, it seems to imply you need a growth rate, I guess, for that vertical that we haven't seen in a while. And so, are there any like, kind of project or one-time revenue that can get you there? Or is it \u2013 I guess, can you help us think through that and anyway to size some of the headwinds, the storm season, the later start, and I guess, as we think about how that kind of impacted kind of the revenue for this quarter or kind of the outlook?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. Tim, well, maybe just to start on your question, the insurance business and aggregate is split probably a little more weighted towards subscription than our overall but roughly if you think about 80%/20% subscription, non-subscription across Verisk Analytics, so I would say that you see a reflection in the business similar to that.", "So, there are elements that are transactional and others are longer term. I think, as Scott observed, we have \u2013 the storm season can have some impact both in transactional and some of the other items. And as we think forward to the quarter, I think we're just pushing hard to do everything that we can to position the business well for the future. And sometimes, we have implementation timelines that are not fully in our control.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, all. Thanks for taking the question.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Sure.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hey, Mark, I'm intrigued by the vertical big data comments especially, I guess, the integration or overlap between commodities, analytics and insurance risk management. Could you elaborate just a little bit, I guess, and talk about what the long-term, you know, maybe the TAM is and the long-term potential to contribute to growth on sort of an enterprise basis. Cause that sounds like somewhere \u2013 an area where you have pretty good competitive differentiation.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So, I think across the insurance value chain, whether it's in the front side of underwriting or inside the claim space, all of our customers are very much looking to become more efficient and improve on the selection of the risks, better pricing of the risks or literally doing claims adjudication kind of in an automatic way. They would really like, for the most part, not touch a lot of claims which would save them money and actually improve their own relationship with the customer.", "So, I'm not sure we've been able to quantify TAM for all of that. But let me just describe to you some of the bigger things that we think are important. One, we highlighted here, as you underwrite a claim \u2013 excuse me, if you underwrite a risk, you have a lot of information that is necessary to underwrite that risk. We want to take and move that to the front-end. We want to do that upfront so that people can be quoting with all that information in mind. And I think that's a big opportunity.", "I think the other opportunity we highlighted here was energy. So, bringing together the big data kind of world of what we do with WoodMac, and the information we have with WoodMac and what we do in insurance, we have found, or at least we think, that the energy market is a little bit more specialized \u2013 it's a little bit the expertise of the players in it. And they really have never had look at, and views into a pricing or a risk assessment approach that we would do with traditional limited insurance. So, this is more of a E&F type asset. It exists in surplus. It's the bigger players across the world and we think this is a, I would say, probably tens of millions type of TAM if not larger.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, thank you. And, the other question I just have is can you talk a little bit about the growth in insurance that you're seeing from international expansion of existing customers and whether or not you think about that as distinct from broader global expansion plans?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. So, I think that's a great question. I think there's two ways we think internationally and as Scott highlighted, it's become very much a priority over the last couple years. There's two things I think we're doing well. There's a couple places, particularly on the claim side of things, where we have a customer, they're using us in a geography, let's use the UK as an example, they like the results they've gotten. We're able to demonstrate strong ROI, and that large global insurer takes us from the UK to other geographies and ultimately, I think the plan would be to implement across all of their operations.", "Once we get into another geography and we customize for that geography, one of the things that we always have to identify and understand is the insurance markets are very different. So, we have to locally customize the software and that's true of things we've been trying to put in place, so that we can then extend down beyond the one customer into many.", "There's other places, kind of the second tact we've taken is, we know markets that look and feel a lot like the U.S. market. It has maybe not the same regulation, but it has the same kind of nature of transfer risk, and we're good and knowledgeable that we can help them. And to the extent that is maybe U.S. speaking and has a more mature market, we're starting there because we can probably be most helpful. I think we've seen some opportunities to do things with buildings as an example.", "Big commercial buildings, we're very good at. We're very knowledgeable of a building that sits in some foreign location, has the same type of risk attributes as long as we can get an understanding of the property characteristics and we can relate a building in whatever foreign region to something here in the United States and we can build out with a lot of imagery.", "So, we're following our customers, one; we're finding like markets, two; and we have a kind of a team that's really focused on trying to accelerate our growth internationally.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman, JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Scott, do you still plan on seeing Verisk combine DA and RA insurance revenue growth to accelerate for full-year 2016 compared to the growth rates of 2015?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "As I've said, we're working hard towards that goal. That is our goal, it remains our goal. And I also laid out sort of what's in the environment right at the moment that is a part of the performance that we will eventually produce.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And that's totally separate from looking at DA financial services, right?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Oh, yeah. Of course. Yes.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Your line is open.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning. So, just wanted a little bit more color on the \u2013 I think, outside of the reinsurance market (29:33) and the quiet storm season, you talked about some contract implementation delays. I was just hoping you could give a little bit more color on that and maybe some examples of what's going on there?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So, this is Mark again. Let me provide a little color. One of the great parts of Verisk is we're deeply embedded into our customer workflows and that's true of a lot of the competitors in which we go after. So, if you were to think about where we try to provide information at the point of underwriting. So, transitioning a customer from another solution to our solution just takes time. It takes a lot of effort from internal IT departments and we just can't always control the timing of those things. We also have contracts, so we know it's going to happen but the timing and where they want to roll out, sometimes they want to roll out regionally as opposed to across the nation. So, those are the type of things that we are kind of referencing there when we talk about timing. So, signed contracts, just look into push implementation where we don't necessarily have as much control as we'd like.", "I think the other comment or, at least, the other thing Scott referenced was in our world, we have a lot of subscription, pretty high visibility, storm, storm activity effects some of our repair cost estimates. There is a variable aspect to that and some of the contracts allow for additional charges when we have higher volumes. And just more broadly, if I'm to answer your question right, storm, storm activity creates what is maybe some pricing opportunity for both reinsurers and primary insurers and that helps the overall state of the market and really just the mindset of insurers who, at this point, are really focused on cutting cost as opposed to growing their book and growing their top line. So, little bit of a mindset as well as build transactional. So, hopefully that provides a little of the color you're looking for.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. That's helpful. And then just on Argus. Obviously, some really good growth there. I was just hoping you could give us some color in terms of the growth coming from the \u2013 what we knew of Argus in terms of the move to financial services elements of the business versus the more media effectiveness that you guys have talked about recently like, is there a way to describe the split in growth there or what's more exciting or where that's coming from?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. It's really very balanced. The growth at Argus is extremely balanced. So, as we've talked about before, there are data management solutions, there are analytic services, there are the contributory data sets, there is the media effectiveness world, there is international expansion. And all of those are contributing.", "So, I really wouldn't point at any one thing. But the wellspring of what Argus is good at is a remarkable ability to integrate large amounts of data, contributed data in an extremely efficient way and then equal capability at turning it into insight and putting it back into the customer's environment in a way that they can consume the analysis and the data very quickly. And so, all the things that I just mentioned are essentially expressions of that same capability.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari, Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, guys. This is (33:13) filling in for Hamzah. Have a question about the talent realignment initiative in Risk Assessment and the overall hiring plans you guys have as you look toward 2017.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Eva, you want to take that?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. Sure. Well, I think, as we mentioned the last quarter, we've been filling in the positions that we had targeted as a part of the talent realignment. Obviously, as we had announced that back in the end of 2014, there was some period of time during which those people had left and the new talent that we were bringing in had not yet joined. I think we've been doing a good job and you've probably seen a few press releases about various people who've joined us and their areas of focus. But I would say that we are working hard to have all of those seats filled. I think that we'll probably talk about this less as we get to 2017.", "Unknown Speaker", "All righty. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler, Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Thank you. On the WoodMac flattish organic constant currency, I'm guessing there's some customers that are under extreme distress or going out of business. So, I'm wondering what the positive offsets are to get to flattish. So, just looking for color around uptake of new solutions, any initial successes with broadening the selling motion. I think you previously said it was undersold. Just what are the positive offsets?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. So, several things around that. First, customers generally have been under pressure, but I don't think it would be correct to draw the conclusion that, if what you're picturing is a lot of industry consolidation and the exit of a lot of players, fewer belly buttons on the customer list are out in the market, that's actually not the case. And in fact, one of the reasons why we were interested to do the small tuck-ins that we did is, in some cases, they actually serve different segments of the market. For example, more pure-play E&P kinds of companies. And so actually, the net effect of all of the acquisitions is that the customer list which used to be circa 1,000 is now closer to 3,000. And so we're obviously very excited about the cross-sell opportunities inside of that.", "Let me just also remind everybody that one of the largest segments that is served by Argus is the financial services world. There are a lot of folks who are interested in understanding what's happening in the hydrocarbon ecosystem that are not \u2013 I'm sorry, did I say Argus, in the WoodMac \u2013 excuse me, I'm addressing WoodMac. One of the largest segments for WoodMac is the financial services segment. And because there are a lot of folks that are interested in the performance of the hydrocarbon ecosystem other than the oil and gas companies and that segment has remained a very important part of what it is that we do. And then WoodMac is, actually yesterday, literally yesterday, launched a new solution, and new solutions have always been a part of the WoodMac story and I think always will be a part of the WoodMac story.", "And yet another thing which is in the environment right now is the oil and gas companies have really trimmed their work staffs, and part of the effect of that is that when the rebound comes, and it will come, I mean, you can just see it coming based upon lack of investment in CapEx. When it comes, the \u2013 our customers will be a little bit shorthanded in terms of talent. And so we think that they'll want to make use of both of our sort of products as well as our services. And you can see little green shoots of some of that even today.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Jeff, it's Eva. I'd just add, I mean, I think we've talked about this before but generally, the WoodMac client base isn't very highly rated investment grade type client base. So, it's not to say there is never something here or there but I think to characterize it overall, despite the industry pressure, it's a very high-quality customer base.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And then on the Touchstone win, just how penetrated is that market in terms of either using your or a competitor's solution? And how does your market share differ between, I guess, U.S. and European-based insurance companies?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So, let me help you out with this. This is Mark. I think if you were to look at the number of insurers, most of the larger insurers use multiple models, so they would use both AIR and the competitive model. What we have seen is more and more people are using us or at least we're winning what I'll refer to as the primary modeling spot. If you're embedded in the workflow, if you're a part of that underwriting decision, the primary model is paid more. The secondary model is used as a reference point and to make sure things look right and to kind of sync up (38:45) with other information. So, it's a checkpoint. Our goal and it continues to be is to displace the competitor and drive towards being that primary model in the biggest insurers where the competitors, historically, had a little bit more prominence.", "The other part of your question is, I would say to you that a large majority of (39:08) of the world uses models. In some cases, they own them themselves and kind of have their own internal staff. In other cases, they work through brokers and we license our product through brokers. So, I think everyone has access to the models. I think it becomes more prominent for larger insurers to own it and have it directly in-house for use by their internal staff. So, they're using more and more models, too. So, that's why Analyze Re provides an opportunity to kind of bring all those modeled outcomes together. You could pick a region, you could pick a model, and you can kind of look at across the book in a portfolio way to do that.", "I think the last part of your question is, we model 100 countries. It think it's 104 countries, all major parallels. We are listening to our customers where they think there's economic loss to be covered. And we will attempt to build models where there is customer feedback and demand, and we think we're pretty well covered, albeit we're always looking to improve and always looking to expand.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. There's also a dynamic in there, which is that there are new modalities of risk. So, cyber would be an example of that or a comprehensive look at risk in the agricultural channel, both of which lend themselves to the kind of stochastic methodology that AIR uses. So, when you think about cat modeling, I would just encourage you to open up the aperture on the view just a little bit. It's a little bit more dynamic. It's actually considerably more dynamic than just earthquakes and hurricanes and weather phenomena.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Hi.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Good morning, Bill.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So, a question for you on WoodMac and the GEM renewals. If you look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, meaning adjusted for currency, GEM dollar renewals on a year-over-year basis, are those trending up, flat, down? And then, how do you look at that trend, how do you expect that trend to look over the next 12 months to 18 months?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So, it's very segment specific inside of the customer base today. There are some segments, who's current situations are sort of more leaning in and growth oriented, and there are somewhere that they've been more heavily impacted by some of the trends in the industry. So, there's really no one answer which sort of covers all of that.", "The way that we manage inside of the energy vertical is the same way that we manage the insurance vertical, actually, everything we do, which is we take a comprehensive view of the relationship with the customer, so when we're thinking about making our proposals, it's a combination of when it's time to renew the existing product or products, but also we're always presenting new solutions that they're not using today.", "And where we come out on a customer-by-customer basis is essentially the net of all of that. So, I would say that in the current moment, we've had to be particularly thoughtful about the pricing on like-over-like when we come to those renewal points. Bear in mind, by the way, that there are multi-year \u2013 a number of multi-year agreements here. So, it's not as if that really predominates in what goes on. But really the outcomes in these negotiations with customers have really been kind of what we expected. And certainly, as we go forward and the environment normalizes, I think that there will be room there.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "And Bill, I just wanted to add. You asked your question kind of narrowly just focused on GEM, I mean, we've had this discussion before, WoodMac is much more than just GEM. We have a lot of offerings there. So, I just wanted to add that color.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Well, fair point. For my follow-on, I wanted to ask about \u2013 a year ago, we started to see some weakness in the non-GEM products, the non-subscription services like consulting. And consulting has historically been a leading indicator within the energy space for the other parts of the business. And I was curious whether you're starting to see \u2013 or how your consulting pipeline is looking there, whether that was one of the green shoots that Scott had mentioned earlier?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, as you know, we don't sort of formally break out the results between the different sides of the business. But the team, the consulting team has been very busy this year. And we actually are talking about as we move into 2017, ways to amplify that team.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Well, thank you very much.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hey. Thanks. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning. Just had a question on the RA side. I'm looking at growth in the quarter. Could you just help us understand some of the components of that, whether it's just growth in end markets versus pricing versus new solutions? I know in the past, you mentioned that you've shifted some of the subscription agreements to value-based-type arrangements. Just trying to understand growth there and how we should we think about it for the next quarter? Thanks.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So, this is Mark. I think we've had a very high subscription rate inside of those industry standard programs, as you know, it's in large part the pricing and the invoice that goes out at the beginning of the year, and it renews, prepaid a quarter in advance for a majority of that revenue, in some cases a full year. So, good visibility.", "The things that kind of cause some, ups and downs if you will. Clearly, we have the opportunity to sell more where there's a customer looking to expand services or a new insurer concept. When two insurers become one inside of mergers, obviously that has some potentially negative downward effect on the way we kind of price. You're correct, a large chunk of the contracts today are kind of multi-year subscriptions, and they have kind of inflationary type of clause in there that is ongoing.", "Last piece of it is, inside industry standard programs, we continue to do a lot as it relates to new products and services. So, if you were to think about ways that people take our content and bring it into their own solutions, we call it Electronic Rating Content. That has been growing nicely. We've done a lot of work around analytics. We called it Risk Analyzer Suite. Those are the type of things. But because of the way we contract, it's usually multi-year and it's kind of spread evenly over the term.", "So, you've been seeing a pretty constant approach to industry standard programs from year-to-year-to-year. I hope that's what you were looking for.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. Okay. Yeah, no, that's helpful. And should we expect, I guess, an improvement from the current levels in terms of growth or the next quarter, the next year?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So, I'll talk long term. I think we need to believe that the solutions and new solutions that I'll refer to as our ISO solutions team continues to produce is promising. I think there's a lot of analytics that are on the pipe. Things like energy we discussed here provides upside and opportunity. So, I think we generally remain pretty confident and remain pretty upbeat about the long-term prospects for insurance.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "We don't view it as a mature business and we manage very much as if it's not a mature business, but one that has the opportunity to grow.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of An Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on your energy insurance unit launch. Realizing its early days, hoping you can share some color on what the initial demand or commercial reception has been. And now that you've married energy to some of your supply chain capabilities, and now insurance, perhaps some thought on where you continue to see opportunities as far as products that combine your areas of expertise?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Sure. So, I think we always had approach where we want to work with our customers for any type of rollout. So, we brought all of our teams together to see what we have and what capabilities and solutions we have to help energy insurers including and featuring a lot of the WoodMac content. With that group together, kind of a cross functional team, we built what we refer to as a minimum viable product. It's something that could be used for demos and used for (48:18) and look into what really can happen. And what our attempt is always to work with partners, development partners, to build out and enhance that solution. So, we are \u2013 have gotten some very nice acceptance and interest from some of the largest players in that space. We have a couple development partners and we are anxiously looking to move forward and trying to move as quickly as we can on that front. I think it opens up some nice opportunities and really provides a little insight into what is a great opportunity to build across the two verticals of Verisk.", "You also had a comment or question about supply chain and I think that offers another kind of opportunity where a lot of different partners.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. We really like the supply chain theme because it lends itself to the kind of stochastic network kind of analytic that we're good at. And in fact, a lot of our supply chain thinking at the moment is directed at one of the most complex supply chains in the world which is around the hydrocarbon ecosystem. And so, we're actually \u2013 that's a place where we're trying to bring together sort of the pattern of thought, and the vertical market.", "The other thing that I think really ties our company together is large-scale data integration and data management which is just \u2013 and it's just the bread and butter of doing what we do, but bringing those methods across all parts of our organization and finding ways to make sure that we're commercializing those opportunities in all of the vertical markets. I think that's, by degree, it's kind of new business for us, and it's exciting. But that, to me, is actually the most \u2013 that's the greatest amount of connective tissue we have across the company.", "Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And as a follow-up, could you speak to your media effectiveness business within financial services? I know you've been more optimistic on the project revenue opportunity there. But wondering if you have any updates you can share with regards to that view. It seems there's some discretionary pullback from some customers in that space. And while I realize you guys aren't (50:32) working on more subscription-type arrangements, does it all change your outlook for the more, more of the larger projects that we've seen in the past?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. Not quite sure what you're referring to with respect to discretionary pullbacks. We had one relationship that was project-based and then got sort of put into just a fundamentally different context. But, no, I mean, 2016 has been a year for the acquisition of some very exciting name brand companies that are definitely new economy kinds of companies that have essentially come into our method. And we've also continued to have a lot of success with our way of partnering with others in the media world to be able to say very unique things to companies that are using old media and new media. And so, it's a very good story. And, it's very broadly based. It's the same story as it was a year ago, exciting and growing.", "Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. Good morning. So, what's causing the slowdown in implementations? Is it decisions on the part of the customer? And have you seen any cancellations?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "No, to your last question. And, basically, some of the things that we do, and I'll actually make a comment about the longer term by the way, but some of things that we do have an on premises quality which require customers and their IT departments to do something in order to get hooked up to our solutions. And so, there are just kind of occasions where, as they're moving into our product suite, they just need to essentially to be sort of scheduling the implementations and that's something that isn't always entirely in our control.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And then, given the reinsurance and demand comments, any early thoughts about maybe your outlook for insurance for 2017? I figured I would try. Thanks.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, we remain very, very excited about our business. And just this fall, having gone through long-range multi-year plans for all parts of the business including all the parts of the insurance business, I think we have the most robust view of new forms of value that we can bring to the market that we've ever had. I think the pipeline of internal opportunities has never been stronger.", "So, insurance remains a world where you can really think of an insurance company as an information factory and there are many, many insurance companies and they're all in different places in terms of their journey towards data analytic proficiency. They are all I think, in varying degrees becoming even more comfortable with the thought of third-parties like ourselves contributing to what it is that they're doing. So, the environment in general, is one that our approach which is vertical data analytics is a meaningful one.", "And we're actually having a two-day customer conference beginning tomorrow for our North American customers and it's very exciting. The attendee list is very exciting and what we're going to be talking about is really interesting, future oriented stuff.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani, KBW. Your line is open", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Hi. Thank you. Quick follow-up. The tax benefit you mentioned from the UK legislation, did you say that was a one-time benefit or could it have an enduring benefit going forward as well?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. So, basically, there are two elements. There was about $0.04 in the quarter that was one-time. The rate basically came down by a percentage point in the UK and there, the change that we make to our deferred tax asset is a result of that, that's the one-time, but obviously the lower rate of one point will continue through the future.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "That's helpful, thanks. And, the other question, I know you said WoodMac, you still expect it to be flat for the year as you said before. Did you say earlier what the organic constant currency was for WoodMac this quarter specifically?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "No. We haven't called that out quarter-by-quarter, but I think we're tracking to the full-year view. And the reason we talk about it that way is that's really consistent with how we run the business.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "All right, perfect. Thank you very much for the answers.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning. I'm outside here, so hopefully you can hear me clearly.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "We can hear you fine.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "My first question was, in the past, you talked about efforts with the connected car and the push to kind of be the part or help to shape the ecosystem for data shared between OEMs, property insurers and drivers. I didn't know if you have anything new on that and how you are thinking about the opportunity there?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So, we continue to be really at the forefront of this as it relates to the insurance industry in connecting OEMs and to others, together with insurers. I think it's just a very difficult process to try to connect with all the numbers, contributors, all the different OEMs as an example, and 300 insurers, 400 insurers that may be interested in it.", "So, we are making good progress with other OEMs, meaning other car manufacturers, as well as folks who do central alarm systems and connected home, things like that, because we think it will be a key element in understanding, assessing and rating in the insurance policy. We've made good progress both here, and it also kind of creates a nice beachhead for us in international expansion opportunities.", "So, I think we are a little ahead of the markets right now, but I think we are well positioned and Scott earlier mentioned, there's a industry conference we're holding later this week, and that will be a featured part of the presentations and we'll have some news information about that as well.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "My last follow-up would be the Argus partnership with Nielsen, some of the market impact of this has been tremendously successful. I was wondering, one, is that agreement exclusive or could you partner with potentially some of the others in that space which is growing rapidly? And similarly, are you thinking of any alternative areas where you could use Argus data outside of the traditional credit suite?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. We're not, Andre, talking about the specific partnerships. I realize that there is sort of chatter in the market, et cetera. But we, ourselves, aren't really talking about who our partners are. But I will say that it's a rich ecosystem and we are relating to a number of players in the space.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "All right. Thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Okay.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call back to our presenters for closing remarks.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest. And I hope and expect we'll see a number of you at our Investor Day next month, and, which we're looking forward to. And until then, be well.

Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics fourth quarter 2016 earnings results conference call. This call is being recoded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.", "David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Scott, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark, and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, for which you can find a reconciliation in our press release. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I'll remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone.", "In the fourth quarter, we again delivered solid revenue growth, leading margins and strong underlying cash generation. The resilience of our financial performance while facing currency and energy and end market headwinds, reflects the distinctiveness of our businesses, the outstanding dedication of our people, and the value we deliver to our customers.", "In addition to a successful 2016, our initiatives during the year position us well to execute on our plans for 2017. Revenue from continuing operations grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. Organic constant currency revenue grew about 6% in the quarter and for the full year. With almost 8% growth in the quarter from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging. WoodMac finished the year slightly better than flat, a remarkable achievement, given the end market headwinds. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins in the quarter and for the full year of around 50%.", "EBITDA growth was around 7% in the quarter and excluding the prior year warrant sale gain was about 12% for the full year. Diluted adjusted EPS grew about 8% in the quarter and for the year and about 11% excluding the prior year warrant gain. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 16%, excluding the one-time tax on the gain on the healthcare business sale. We were pleased to continue returning capital to our shareholders through our longstanding share repurchase program. We bought $144 million of stock in the quarter and after an additional $500 million authorization. We had over $600 million available as of December 31, 2016.", "With our leverage below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity to make strategically relevant acquisitions, as well as additional repurchases. We made a number of tuck-in acquisitions in 2016 and early this year, which collectively have brought us new data sets, adjacent solutions, distinctive analytics, additional markets to serve, and outstanding data analytics talent. In many cases, the acquisitions also accelerate our strategies, at a lower cost relative to a build approach.", "We benefit from our flexibility to decide whether to innovate organically or via acquisitions. We remain active in evaluating possible transactions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement efforts. The foundations of our businesses remain the Verisk distinctives of one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first to market innovations; and four, deep integration into our customer workflows.", "Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, who enhanced the distinctiveness of our business, as we focus on serving our customers with innovative data analytics solutions. We feel very good about our ability to serve our customers and drive top-line growth for the long-term as a result. We are well-positioned for 2017 with contributions expected from existing and newly acquired businesses. We continue to invest in innovation, and I'm excited about the multi-year opportunities for solutions under development this year.", "So with that, let me turn the call over to Mark for some additional comments.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Scott.", "Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we had several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation, and digital engagement. As we serve our customers with these themes in mind, we made a number of tuck-in acquisitions to complement our organic efforts. We made two acquisitions to enhance our strong position in extreme event modeling. Analyze Re extends AIR's capabilities farther downstream by providing real-time solutions for reinsurance treaty pricing, enterprise portfolio roll-up, and portfolio optimization.", "Last month, we acquired Arium, which provides modeling solutions and analytics for the casualty market. Our vision is to leverage Arium's capabilities to allow us to do for casualty analytics, what we've done for property analytics. Arium's solutions provide analytics for liability exposures, including visual and quantitative insights into accumulations in areas of risk concentration. These acquisitions got us to market faster and at a lower cost than if we had built the solutions ourselves.", "We also acquired MarketStance, a leading provider of data analytics solutions that enable insurers to identify high potential market segments of interest. This gives us a broader set of solutions with which to serve our customers' marketing departments.", "Another of our recent acquisitions was The GeoInformation Group, a leader in geographic data solutions based in the UK, where we are expanding. The GeoInformation Group offers large-scale mapping services and geospatial data and analytics solutions to a wide array of companies and public sector organizations. This acquisition complements our risk management and predictive analytic capabilities internationally and expands Verisk's footprint in the UK across multiple verticals including insurance, energy, and real estate.", "Finally, just last week, we acquired Healix Risk Rating, a leader in automated risk assessment at the point-of-sale for the travel insurance industry. This acquisition further expands our Risk Assessment offerings for the global insurance industry, providing solutions that are embedded in our customer workflows and can help our insurers underwrite travel insurance with greater speed, accuracy and efficiency. These tuck-in acquisitions are close to our core insurance business and support our deep analytic expertise, unique data and global focus.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Eva to cover the financial results.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Mark.", "In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we again grew both revenue and EBITDA, while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6% and 6.2% organically in constant currency. For the full year, revenue grew 13.3% and 5.8% organically in constant currency. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.9% in the quarter and 6.9% for the full year.", "As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. EBITDA grew 7% to $258 million in the quarter and 11.9% to $1 billion for the full year. The full-year growth excludes the 2015 warrant sale gain. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter and 50.4% for the full year.", "Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 6.5% and 7.3% organically in constant currency. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest growing vertical, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. For the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 18.5% and 6.3% organically in constant currency.", "Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7.5% in the fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.3% in the quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by strong growth in underwriting solutions, with good contributions from claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions. Catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to growth.", "For the full year, revenue grew 8.1% on a reported and organic basis. The full-year Decision Analytics insurance growth is consistent with what we delivered in 2015. Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth.", "Energy and specialized markets category revenue declined 0.3% in the quarter and increased 43.4% for the full year. On a constant currency basis, WoodMac was up slightly for the full year. We were expecting the results to be about flat, and as a result we were pleased with the performance.", "Consistent with our longstanding approach, WoodMac became a part of organic revenues starting in the third quarter. Revenue for energy and specialized markets excluding the recent acquisitions declined 5.5% in the quarter and for the full year, primarily as a result of the continuing end market and currency headwinds affecting the energy business.", "Financial services category revenue increased 27.3% in the quarter and 10.1% for the full year. Growth was driven by analytical and media effectiveness solutions. Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.1% and 4.4% organically in the quarter, continuing to demonstrate the value to our longstanding insurance customers, contributions of newer solutions, and the inclusion of recent acquisitions.", "Risk Assessment growth was 5.2% and 5% organically for the full year. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.9% in the quarter and 5.4% organically, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as Predictive Models and Electronic Rating Content. Growth was 5.6% for the full year and 5.3% organically.", "Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 2.6% in the quarter and 1.4% organically.

Your line is open.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you. First, just I wanted to ask for a little bit more color on the insurance vertical. I guess, the growth while you had talked last quarter that you didn't expect that part of the business to accelerate this year, I guess, it still seems to have been probably a little slower than you used to see. So can you talk about the puts and takes that you're seeing just, I guess, within that vertical?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Hi, Tim. This is Mark. Just I want to give you the color you're asking for. First of all, I think, we continue to feel very good about the insurance vertical overall, the combination of greater customer engagement in form of better interactions, higher level interactions, big topics being discussed, as well as a lot of new innovations we're excited by. Inside some of the macro, you do have some headwinds with regard to the world of premium growth industry consolidation, but I think those are to a lesser extent kind of more distinct and I think the team performed well, inside of a couple of, what I refer to as some industry slowdown, but we maintain a very positive outlook for the future.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "I guess just a follow-up in the context of that, I guess, tougher industry environment I assume that's going to continue into 2017. Would you expect the growth rate to stay at a little lower level in that environment? And is that the kind of way you're thinking about it now or how are you thinking about it?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So I would say to you that if you are focused on kind of the industry premium growth, a lot of our contracts now have kind of moved beyond and away from that. So there is clearly a focus on procurement and cost containment inside of our customers, so that's a little bit of what I was referring to. But in what I see is a lot of industry automation that's happening, people are relooking at processes, people are relooking at how their systems operate, and that has given us some big opportunities and some nice pipeline.", "The other thing I'll highlight as we continue to be talking about here, kind of U.S. premium growth, we continue to have aspirations and some opportunities that extend beyond United States, and the international global expansion remains a key priority for us as we look forward. So, I think we remain positive across the board there. I hope that's responsive.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yeah. And just to continue on that, one follow-up. The cat modeling area seems to have been the slowest growing part this quarter for Decision Analytics, as it was last quarter. I recognize the issues in the reinsurance sector, but are you comfortable that you are still picking up as much market share as you were in the past? You seem to have grown faster relative to your main competitor there even in the past, I guess versus lately.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So I think we are continuing to make a lot of progress there. You've probably hit on couple of the topics, although a smaller piece, the world of insurance-linked transactions is a little lighter so that probably has brought some of that revenue down a little bit. More importantly though, we from the standpoint of working with insurers and reinsurers we have been growing like we have in the past. I don't think there's any slowdown there. When we talk about industry trends though, there is a headwind relative to when \u2013 if there's industry consolidation among insurers. So you see some of that inside the growth as well.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Scott, I guess with reference to your comments early on in terms of being well-positioned for 2017 with new and existing solutions, I was hoping you could maybe touch on some of the new ones you were referring to, and if that changes the \u2013 I guess the trend in the growth rates you are seeing right now, if there's any material pickup that we should expect in 2017.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "The innovations are very broadly based. They cover many, many different aspects of the insurance value chain, and I'll just reference a few, but there are really so many. So we're working on helping our customers that are doing aggregate portfolio analytics with better portfolio tools. This relates in parts to what we added with Analyze Re.", "We have platforms which speed up the underwriting process. We have new data sets, which relate to among other things, the underwriting of auto policies, which is related to the Telematics Data Exchange. We're making better use of remote imagery in helping the claims and increasingly the underwriting processes to move ahead.", "We're bringing new forms of data management to the insurance vertical. One of the things that \u2013 and Mark was referencing this before, the big data movements. Last year, I spent a good deal of time with the CEOs of our largest customers. They are very interested in the nature of their technical environments. Everything from our potential conversion to more of a cloud basis, in terms of our computing being a primary consideration, but they realized that like a lot of companies in the world today, that we need to grow beyond the first version of the enterprise data warehouse movement, which was actually a late 1990s, early 2000 thing.", "So these are very, very significant topics for our customers, and I can keep going on, the overlap between energy and insurance. So it's very broadly based and that's consistent with who we are basically. We're very deeply engaged with our customers and so that's why we're able to move out on such a broad set of fronts.", "And Mark referenced before the macro environment, balancing the macro environment in the United States, as he said, is the fact that our ambitions are global and we've really had much less activity in non-domestic markets, but that's a factor which is here and which I believe will be increasingly significant as we go forward, so very pleased with where we sit.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And then in terms of a follow-up, just with respect to CapEx, again I guess if fell in 2016 at least on a dollar basis and it's ticking back up. I mean, are there any unusual items in there or one-time-ish that need to be called out or just looking at it forward, should we think of 7.5% to 8% as the new normal for the CapEx spend?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Hey, Manav, it's Eva. Good morning. Just in terms of CapEx, I think, the numbers when you said it fell and it did not fall in dollars if you're looking on an apples-to-apples basis, remember we have continuing ops and we have the divestiture of Verisk Health. So I think as I said in the script, you actually saw dollar growth in the year. The percentage was about 7.3% in the year, so as we've talked about we've been managing that CapEx. We had some investment over a several year period where it kind of peaked and now we're kind of bringing that back down. What we're doing though really is we're striking the balance between being efficient with the dollars we're spending and ensuring that we're investing in that internally developed software, which is a lot of the platforming that we've been talking about.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it, thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Eva, it's Andrew. Given the healthy margins in the fourth quarter, I wanted to know if the company is positioned to have margin expansion in 2017 including the comments that you made about FX in the small acquisitions.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So thanks for the question, Andrew. I think as we think about EBITDA margins, as you know there are a mix of number of things that go in there. FX is certainly a weight on margins and the acquisitions, as we said, the small tuck-ins, I think their margins are appropriate for the stage of development they're in, but they are a drag on margins. So while we're not giving specific guidance in terms of the margin, I would say that those are probably the balancing factors you should consider when you think about your model.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Could you give us a sense of size of those two factors?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I think that if you were to think about \u2013 we gave you the dollars of revenue on FX. That's about a $25 million drag, just apples-to-apples, if we were to use constant currency here. In terms of the acquisition margins, you can look just in the filings, we'll be happy to walk you through the math after the call, the margins for those, and so I think you'll be able to figure that into your model.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thank you. Just given the insurance industry comments, is the annual invoicing impact this year similar order of magnitude to past years to recent years?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So this is Mark. I just want to make sure I have the question. We have typically and traditionally invoiced around the holidays in anticipation of the future year. So this would be December of 2016.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Correct.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Timing and everything is unchanged. I think the second part of your question, I'm going to read into it is that I think with every passing year we've started to engage with our biggest customers to put in place what are longer-term contracts that are unrelated to premium. So what you'll see is a majority of that revenue that we would typically talk about in industry-standard programs is now unrelated to premium. It's all about a negotiated outcome. If they want to add a new service, obviously, there would be additional fees to be charged. But everything is consistent with the past. It's probably a little less focused on premium going forward.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great. And then in terms of the increased cadence of tuck-in M&A, including a lot in the insurance vertical, is this just a moment in time where there's a flurry or is there something that's changed, whether it's culturally making everybody part of the M&A team or something about the end markets, something strategically, just a comment on the increased cadence of tuck-in M&A?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You really answered your own question. We about, I don't know, maybe 18 months ago or so, we basically really began campaigning throughout the entire company for the notion that everybody is on the M&A team. And what we mean by that specifically and relating this to the interest of our shareholders, because we're walking the hallways of our customers' offices on a daily basis, we actually have intelligence that is not available broadly in the world. And in specific, we get a chance to see other companies that are perhaps emerging and at least beginning to make a difference for our mutual customers. And so we've really just hit very hard the idea that that intelligence is an additional source of value for our shareholders. And so we have really engaged at an even deeper level with the folks in our business units, and this is the result basically.", "So no, I don't think that this is \u2013 it is a moment in time in the sense that we've put an increased emphasis on this at a point in time about 18 months ago. But I don't think it's a transient phenomenon. I don't know that we'll always be putting points on the board at exactly this rate. We'll see how it goes, nor do we start with the assumption that it's all about size. If they're strategic, we're happy to do midsized deals, large deals, smaller deals. But I would encourage you to think of the smaller deals as reflective of a very active strategy which is about expanding our source as a value for our customers. And as Eva said in her remarks, there's just a balance here between buy and build, and we're very open to what gets us to the valuable place fastest. So no, not a moment in time although something did change in our environment.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay, thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "I'm wondering just, Mark and Scott, as a follow-up on some of the competitive questions, particularly insurance. Is there anything you're seeing changing on the ground as far as new competition or new technology? And I'm thinking specifically within underwriting and maybe even geospatial and aerial imaging.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I wouldn't really point to new competition. I think that there are classes of folks that have money to invest who have been on the theme of insurance and are in and around it. I think a couple of private equity players and then there are a couple of operating companies that have had the theme for a while. But when you look at the actual operations that are out there assembling information, creating solutions, et cetera, it's really a very slowly \u2013 almost no change actually in terms of the cast of characters. So ownership may shift some, but the actual on-the-ground operation and delivery, I don't really see that changing very much.", "What you do have at the margin are some companies that come more from a big data horizontal methods approach and attempt to work their way into the insurance industry, actually not just the insurance industry, but if you think about all of our verticals, that's a theme out there, which is one of the reasons why we really beat the drum for vertically-oriented data analytics, because we really think that's a very strong place to stand and it's in the verticals the proprietary data grow up.", "So there are those kinds of players who are out there. And of course there is technical innovation as well. So for example, if you were to pick the category of drones, there is a list of companies who would like to help outfits you with one or two or three or five drones. That list of companies is as long as both of my arms. But the literal difference that they're making in the insurance industry today is low, is very low, very modest. And so no, I don't really \u2013 the bottom line is and this is actually true of everything that we do, competition does not fundamentally determine our opportunity or what it is that we're doing. It is all about our relationship with the customers and our ability to really understand their needs and harness methods and technology and data and get them to where they need to be. That is what makes the difference between \u2013 or spells the outcome in terms of, for example, our growth rate.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And when I look at WoodMac with the churn in oil prices, I'm wondering if 2017 is likely to be a significantly more positive growth year, how are you thinking about your view on WoodMac business this year?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Let me characterize generally and Eva might care to add something. But the point I really want to emphasize here is really the tremendous performance of Wood Mackenzie in the face of kind of historic conditions. And I was impressed last year spending time with the CEOs and senior members of WoodMac's customer set as well as our others, was how much depth of relationship WoodMac enjoys, we enjoy with our customers and the regard that customers have for us. And a very active set of new product initiatives, which I think are aimed at just exactly where the industry is. And so that's the bedrock. Those are the things which are really core.", "But definitely the conditions in 2017 are better than they were in 2016 and 2016 was at least the stabilization relative to 2015. So yes, the environment's moving in the right direction. And it's another part of our forward view of being very pleased with where we are with WoodMac. Eva, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, I was just going to add I think if you wanted to start with customer retention remained very high in 2016 despite what was obviously a challenging environment. And so that's really the basis on which we start to grow going forward, we start with the existing clients. One thing just to keep in mind is, as Scott talked about, we have new products. There's lots of things that we can sell. The fundamental base of WoodMac remains our subscription business. And so that will \u2013 as it creates stability in a downturn, it also takes a little while for that to kind of pick back up. So I think we're very positive on WoodMac, just remember that subscriptions don't turn on a dime, but I think we're optimistic about 2017.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari, your line is open.", "Kayvon Rahbar - Macquarie Group", "Yes, hi. This is Kayvon. I'm filling in for Hamzah. I have a question for you guys about the Decision Analytics business. How much of that is subscription and how much room do you guys think you have for converting it \u2013 for conversion, how has that been going over time?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I think what you'll see is, I mean, you will less subscription in Decision Analytics and Risk Assessments, but still a very, very high level, and overall we're at about 80%, 85% in the whole company. It's interesting, because I think what you tend to see is as we're converting certain parts of that business too from transactional to subscription, we're bringing in actually new solutions which tend to start transactional. So I don't expect that over time you're going to see a grand shift in that as long as we're doing what we want to do which is create those new solutions.", "Kayvon Rahbar - Macquarie Group", "All right, thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys. This is Patrick in for Toni. So the first question is I'm wondering if you guys are expecting financial services to achieve another year of double-digit growth in 2017.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So as we think about our company, I think the way we've really framed it for the market is the total growth of the company and aiming for the organic growth that we've talked about historically rather than parsing it into individual segments. Certainly financial services has been a strong pro forma for us, and we think there are a lot of things going on within that area that are pretty exciting. But I wouldn't put a specific growth rate on it at the moment for you.", "Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. And then it looks like normalized free cash flow conversion ticked up a few points year-over-year but remained below the 60% of EBITDA target you've talked about in the past. Is 60% still your target? And if so can you talk about some of the leverage you have to reach that goal?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I'm not quite sure where the 60% target is coming from. I don't know that that's something that we've stated. I think that we were very pleased with the conversion of the free cash flow. Clearly, there are just a couple of things that come out after you have EBITDA, I mean, you've got to pay taxes, so certainly we do that as we should. I would say that the working capital remains a positive contributor there. CapEx would be the other offset. So I think, fundamentally, we feel good about where we are in terms of free cash flow generation.", "Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks, Eva.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. On Risk Assessment, specifically property-specific underwriting, the organic there seem to have ticked down a bit sequentially. I was just wondering if that was due to anything specific.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So first of all, it's business as usual in property-specific. If you actually kind of look through 2016, you'll see the revenue there per quarter is anywhere from $42.4 million each quarter inching up about to about $42.7 million. We did sign a couple nice contracts in fourth quarter of 2015, so that helped us in 2015, probably creates a bit of a grow over in the fourth quarter of 2016, but I think it's a wonderfully consistent business that's had some stable growth.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. And just a last question still on Risk Assessment. Is the hiring there basically complete now or is that still ongoing?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "It's a good question. I think we are getting through it, signing the right people. We're very selective, and we had some new initiatives in Risk Assessment that we're excited by and we're going to probably bring in some talent to lead those efforts. So not completely done. I think that will continue to have or add some expense inside of Risk Assessment as we progress through 2017.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you very much for the answers.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. I wanted to ask the growth rate question for the individual businesses a little bit differently. Is there anything we should be aware of from a business perspective that would impact the present growth rate that we exited 2016, heading into 2017, obviously excluding the FX in those individual business lines?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean we're back to the same point we were on before, which is we've noted what's in the macro environment. And Eva talked about currency, Mark talked about the in the moment condition of the insurance industry. I would just add the financial services companies are wondering where they're at right now. U.S. financial services companies maybe on the one hand, there will be some deregulation, and on the other hand they've been dealing with mounting compliance requirements and have felt some squeeze on the bottom line, and we've talked about the environment in at WoodMac.", "But the counterpoint to all of that is our program of investments, and creating new solutions and our ever deepening relationships with our customers. Those two things are the wellspring of our future performance.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Got it. Okay.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "And we feel very good about those things.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And how should we think about the breakdown or the focus of investments in 2017? Anything you'd like to call out as areas that you're keenly focused on outside of the international growth? Thanks.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean I would say that we're investing across all the different verticals that we're in and pretty excited. I think international growth is certainly a highlight as well. So I think it's pretty broad-based.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "We have noted for you all in the past that there is an increasing software intensity to our business which is essentially another way of saying that we're a solutions-oriented company. And I think that that's a true statement. But we've moved into that position over the last couple of years. I think I don't know that the relative software intensity is going up from where we are, but that's a drumbeat inside the business.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks so much. And just looking at the cost of revenue in the quarter that you booked, it was fairly high compared to last year. Were there any one-time items going on either this year or last year, and is this the kind of rate we should look for going forward in 2017?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I think the best way to think about it is in aggregate. And as we think about the business and the cost of revenue versus SG&A, sometimes there are things that, that balance between those depending upon where we are in development versus implementation of those solutions. So I don't think that there's any conclusion to draw from that as you look forward to 2017.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "So let me ask the question another way. If I take the combination of cost of revenue and SG&A again, the run rate that we saw in the fourth quarter would be something we'd use for 2017?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I think that's certainly a starting point. Again, I think there are a number of things that go on within those numbers, but that would be the baseline (43:40).", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "All right, and one more quick numbers question. What should we be looking forward for stock based compensation this year?", "Eva F.

Your line is open.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, good morning. I know you had a couple points about your international expansion goals being part of the M&A strategy, and I know you now have a hub in the UK on the back of the WoodMac acquisition. I was just wondering how we should think about your focus on UK businesses as opposed to other parts of the EU, given each country there operates very locally.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah, so let me start there and then maybe Mark will fill in with a little bit of detail around the insurance vertical specifically. But at the general level, first of all, we have beefed up our corporate development capability in Europe and we're in the process of beefing it up in Asia as well, so it's really an around-the-globe view of our opportunities. And that expresses itself both as acquisition. You've seen some of that in the more recent acquisitions, also partnerships, and we really like both flavors and we'll be spending time on both of those flavors.", "But I really compliment the question, Andre, because it really is the case that if you are a data analytic company and you take the data dimension of the data analytic agenda seriously, then you have to find this third way to operate basically if you want to be global, because there's the one form which is you make it wherever, Copenhagen, Detroit, whatever, and you export it around the world. That tends to relate more to physical goods. And then there's the second form, which is just you become utterly local, completely local in what it is you do, and the whole really doesn't become greater than the sum of the parts.", "If you're a high intellectual property company with the databases, you actually have to find a third way, which is you can manufacture your methods centrally. But I think in line with what you're trying to get at, you actually have to occupy each marketplace because there is in the world today and will be in the world increasingly in the future what I call data nationalism. Most countries work very hard to make sure that their data physically resides in their country. And in fact, the follow-on to the Safe Harbor in the EU was just a particular example of the general case, where there's just concern about where do our data physically reside. And so you do actually have to become local in order to have access to the data.", "So you have to be the third way or we have to be the third way anyway. And so we're working very hard on that, and that is everything from where we place our people to how we deploy our people. And so here's where I now want to turn it to Mark because he led us through a very significant reorganization towards the end of last year with respect to our go-to-market folks in overseas markets. So, Mark, maybe you want to talk about that, including how broadly based this particular program is.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks, Scott. So I think what we've tried to do is identify markets that are, A), mature and like the U.S. markets. That's where our solutions act and feel the best. Obviously, we have the focus on some of the emerging markets too, but where we're currently putting most of our resources is also where we have customers, so that we have the ability to follow a customer to different geographies.", "So that focus has led us to really take a lot of people who have been typically in different business units and put them into what we refer to as our global business development teams. And those teams are working across all of our insurance operations to really focus in on different markets and opportunities across all the solutions we offer. So that reorg provides us with a focus on customer, better relationship with customer, and talking about Verisk, not individual point solutions, and that's starting to make a difference.", "The other thing I'll just contribute, and by the way, those business development teams are across the world. You had brought up UK as an example. Clearly the UK market feels the most like the U.S. market. There's a lot of movement between risks between London and the U.S. And as a result, we're most dedicated and most focused right now on the UK. And you can see that not just from an organic perspective, but some of the acquisitions we've done, whether it's with GeoInformation, Healix, even Arium is from the UK. So we think we're starting to make a difference and we are very much focused on bringing that opportunity, I call that third dimension to the cube here into a positive and profitable light here over the course of the next couple of years.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Maybe that's more than you expected, Andre, but we really care about this trend actually. You bumped into something that we do a lot of work on.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "We're glad to spend the time. Thank you for the question.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, thank you. So last quarter, you highlighted that there were some delays in implementation of contracts that have already been signed. Can you just provide an update on this?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. I think that we're progressing as expected. That's really a comment as its related to the revenue that would be received in 2016.", "David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, got it. And then in regards to WoodMac, you didn't lose too many clients despite lower oil prices in 2016. So does this suggest that we shouldn't expect a meaningful lift to client count this year, despite higher oil prices?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I'm sorry, you cut out just for a second we shouldn't expect, could you repeat that part?", "David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Like a significant lift to client count this year, despite higher oil prices.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, I actually think that we've expanded, and I know that Steve Halliday spoke about this on Investor Day. We've actually expanded our customer base, fairly significantly through some of the new solutions and companies that we've brought into the WoodMac mix.", "So actually what we're looking to do is, we're looking to grow those customers into broader solution purchases throughout WoodMac. So I think you have to think about the customer base a little more broadly than just the core you might have thought about when WoodMac first came into the family.", "David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Your line is open.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. Good morning. If I could just go back to the international insurance strategy and opportunity over time, it seems to me, the key to the U.S. business or one of the keys is certainly the consortia data model that you've built. And unless I'm misunderstanding this, you really haven't had success creating organically the same level of consortia dataset to be the core in any other market, and I know you've talked about doing that successfully with the Argus business in other geographies. So why have you not been able to do that? What's the gating factor? And maybe more forward-looking optimistically what's the outlook for doing that to deliver the kind of business that you have here in the U.S. over time? Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Let me just put your question in a slightly different context, which is we continue to feel that proprietary data is an advantage and one that we always pursue. We recite it as one of the four distinctives, so it's always there in our minds. There are two ways that you can build a proprietary dataset. One is you can have an a priori discussion with the market you're trying to serve and essentially get agreement that let's all join hands and take the plunge together and start putting our data into one place where we haven't previously put it. That's the history of our early roots in the insurance industry. Argus has proven to be very effective at doing that.", "Wood Mackenzie is always about proprietary data, and it ends up being a consortium, but I want to relate it now to the second way that you can build a dataset, which is you can also go customer-by-customer. And you provide them solutions and as a part of having earned their trust, you ask for the opportunity to use and repurpose the data, which is flowing through your application.", "We do it both ways. We've always done it both ways. And in some markets that maybe that we can leap straight to the consortia, Argus has had particular success at that. And in other markets, whether they're defined by vertical or geography, we may have to do more of the second method which is on a customer-by-customer basis. So I just want you to have that perspective because we don't \u2013 we never lose sight of the goal to create proprietary data assets. It's more a question of how you go about it.", "Specific to the insurance industry, what goes on particularly, as you look at, I'd say especially Europe, is you've got differences in terms of both regulation and market structure. And of course those two things go together, regulation has an effect on market structure. And essentially Europe, European primary P&C markets generally tend to be more concentrated. And so the larger share player is naturally going to say, let me think about it a little bit more before I make my data available. And so that's really just a condition that we deal with, but we're not deterred in the least in terms of trying to move towards proprietary data assets. It's just the pathway maybe a little bit different.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And so what are the long term implications about the potential profitability of an insurance business overseas, given that concentration? Should we read into that, that it's unlikely even at scale to achieve the margins you've done here in the U.S.?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "No, I would not draw that conclusion. If you look at the most profitable parts of what we do whether it's in insurance or other places, there is a very nice mix of businesses which are built on our priority consortia data, and businesses which are not built on our priority consortia data. So you can get there both ways.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, everybody, for your time and your interest today. I know that we're going to be \u2013 we'll be following up with several of you even later today. We're going to have events in the course of the coming months. Some of you'll come see us in the office, and we're looking forward to being with you. So thanks for your time today.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's EVP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen.", "Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.", "David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Ivy, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for discussion of our third quarter 2017 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.", "Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.", "The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures, which we will reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.", "Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, David. Good morning, all. Reported revenue grew 10% for the quarter, organic constant currency growth was 7%. We're pleased to have delivered faster organic growth in the third quarter than we saw in the first half of the year as expected. We remain on track for an acceleration in the second half versus the first half. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of almost 50%.", "We're excited about the addressable markets we serve, our initiatives to create new solutions, and the opportunities to help our customers with decision-making. Combined insurance organic growth was 9% and excluding the demand due to extreme weather was about 7%. The team continues to do an outstanding job serving our customers and driving growth. Mark will talk about some of the extraordinary effort by our teams to support our customers in responding to the recent hurricanes.", "At WoodMac, revenue growth continues to improve as the end market has stabilized. The team there is also doing an excellent job, evidenced in part by the 5% plus growth in subscription ACV year-to-date. WoodMac is expanding their addressable markets and we will demo some of their newer products at our upcoming Investor Day.", "We're very pleased to report a new Argus partnership with TSYS as announced by their CEO on their recent investor call. This partnership will allow us to bring a new range of data management and analytical solutions to new banks and markets that are incremental to our core base. This initiative, as well as other positive developments at Argus, position it to return to solid organic growth in Q4 as expected and continue to contribute good and accelerating organic growth in 2018.", "On the capital allocation front, we have been active in M&A throughout 2017 and especially in the third quarter. Many of the acquisitions are companies we have been tracking for years, and the timing is mostly a function of the availability of the targets. While the timing has been brisk, the integrations have been smooth and quick, given the nature of our purchases.", "Our acquisitions in 2017 fall into three groups. The first group consists of small product sets with promising characteristics that fall into our existing verticals. The names here are Arium, ENI, Healix, Fintellix and MAKE. Collectively we paid $94 million for these product sets with run rate revenue at the time of the acquisitions of around $23 million.", "Arium provides liability loss modeling that runs parallel to AIR's property loss modeling. ENI helps insurers determine damage amounts to automobiles for quick claim settlements and Helix is the leading provider of travel insurance analytics in Europe. Fintellix is a global leader in compliance solutions for banks and seamlessly relates to our transaction-level data integration at Argus, while bringing new functionality to our client banks and MAKE is the global leader in wind generation analytics, integrating seamlessly with our solar generation analytics.", "In all cases, we have quickly brought these products into our existing channels of distribution with the expectation that all of these product sets will grow at double-digits for an extended time and with ramping margins. When we add such products to our platform they immediately gain profile and credibility in the market.", "The second group was our acquisition of seven regional remote imaging companies in the United States. We paid $31 million for these companies whose 2016 revenues were $15 million as we noted last quarter. Integration of these companies has been smooth and straightforward, led by our Geomni team which includes experts who have operated image capture operations for decades. Their expertise brought real value to customers in the latest storm season.", "Lastly, we bought three larger companies in the third quarter, all leaders in their categories. We purchased Sequel, which provides solutions related to complex commercial insurance with a particular focus on the Lloyd's London market as well as LCI and G2 Web Services, both of which provide distinct solutions for the retail banking world and both of which leverage Argus' distribution as well as enhancing products through overlapping capabilities. Collectively we paid $583 million for these businesses, whose run rate revenue at the time of the acquisitions was about $78 million.", "Mark will say more about them in a moment but in all three cases we expect them to bring strong double-digit growth with ramping margins. We will provide further detail on these businesses including their solutions, markets, and economics at our upcoming Investor Day in December.", "While M&A remains our priority for use of free cash, we also repurchased our shares in the quarter through our longstanding program. Year-to-date through September 30, we have repurchased $270 million worth of stock including $10 million in the third quarter.", "At September 30, 2017, we had $366 million remaining under our share purchase reauthorization (sic) [share repurchase authorization] (06:49). Our strong cash generating capability will bring down our leverage even assuming further capital deployment.", "We remain confident in the strategy built on the Verisk distinctives of one, unique data assets, two, deep domain expertise, three, first to market innovations and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. As you know, with the distinctives come network effects, scale economies and a large percentage of subscription revenue. From this foundation we are focused on executing on our plans which include ongoing innovation and serving our customers. As we look ahead we have a constructive view for all of our businesses.", "And with that I'll turn it over to Mark for some additional comments.", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Scott. Following up on Scott's comments regarding the three August acquisitions, Sequel is a leading insurance and reinsurance software specialist serving the London market. The acquisition further expands our comprehensive insurance offerings to the global complex commercial and specialty insurance industry with worldwide premiums larger than the U.S. regulated market we primarily serve today. Sequel is a pioneer in complex commercial and specialty insurance software innovation with a diverse customer base that includes some of the world's largest specialty insurance players.", "LCI is an industry-leading provider of risk insight, prediction and bankruptcy management solutions for banks and creditors. We're also confident that the LCI solutions are applicable beyond the banks to other companies that need to monitor consumer bankruptcy processes. The combination of Argus and LCI will allow us to introduce new and exciting range of insights, proprietary decisioning algorithms, and state-of-the-art risk management work flow solution aimed at addressing a growing need among our banking clients.", "G2 is an industry-leading provider of merchant risk intelligence solutions for acquirers, commercial banks and other payment system providers. G2 extends Argus' capabilities to mapping bad-actor networks, predicting payment risks and providing clients with the best opportunity to reduce losses and fines due to merchant and business fraud and compliance violations. Fighting fraud is an important theme for Verisk as you know, and G2 complements our existing capabilities nicely.", "Growth in insurance continued to improve, primarily on the strength of our solutions in customer relationships with some help from the weather. Engagement with our customers is a strong and ongoing focus across our insurance-facing businesses. Last month, for example, we had our now annual U.S. Risk and Analytics Summit. We saw record attendance in terms of companies represented and number of attendees. We also had demonstrations of some of our newer and cutting edge solutions. Feedback was very encouraging with attendees citing engaging and well-informed speakers, the examples of benefits from forward-looking companies and thought provoking panels.", "As you know, after an unusually long period of relative calm we have seen a surge in catastrophes over the past few months. Our property claims services or PCS business is the industry standard for catastrophe event designation and insured loss estimation in the U.S., Canada and Turkey. In one of the most active periods on record, PCS has designated 50 events so far across three risk areas with insured loss estimates still developing but likely to exceed $70 billion.", "In addition to the major hurricanes in the United States, PCS provided insured loss estimates on two cyber risk loss events following the launch of PCS Global Cyber in September. Cyber is the latest addition to the growing PCS Global specialty lines loss reporting platform following the PCS Global Marine and Energy launch earlier this year.", "Our catastrophe modeling business which serves insurers, reinsurers and insurance brokers has proactively provided more than 30 loss estimates since September 1 and real-time alerts for customers on 13 catastrophes happening around the world. With particular note to the hurricanes, AIR clients use the information we provided to assess the potential losses as the events were unfolding and in some cases to proactively deploy claims adjusters or to notify policy holders.", "As a reminder, since the customers subscribe to AIR solutions there isn't a real-time revenue benefit. Client feedback has been positive as our teams have worked in some cases around the clock to give these reports to the market on a timely basis. We continue to speak with clients on their actual loss experience and plan to continue these dialogues over the coming months as the claims unfold.", "In our repair cost estimating imagery business, volumes increased meaningfully as a result of catastrophes. At Xactware, volumes were nearly double for the quarter versus the prior-year period. As a reminder, many of our contracts are based on minimum volumes, so this volume increase isn't a direct proxy for revenue growth, it does highlight deep more full (11:50) integration and the value we provide to our customers.", "One of our newer solutions, Claim Experience, proved to be a very helpful tool for our customers as they served their insurance. Claim Experience allows our customers' customers to capture images and information from which we are able to generate repair cost estimates. As the industry focus on customer service and response times, this new solution is generating a lot of incremental interest.", "Geomni, our remote imagery business, which we took to a new level of capability in the second quarter, was able to assist our customers with our cutting edge technology. We were flying and capturing images 48 hours after Harvey in Texas and as soon as the FAA lifted flight restrictions in Florida. These images, in combination with our computer vision algorithms, automate the repair cost estimate processing, allowing, for example, one of the largest insurers in the United States to start paying out claims before their customers could even get back into their homes. We are proud of having been able to help our customers deliver such outstanding service and speed of response at such a critical time for homeowners.", "With that, let me turn it over to Eva, to cover our financial results in more detail.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Mark. In the third quarter we again grew revenue and EBITDA while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Growth improved again, consistent with our comments on the last two earnings calls.", "Revenue in the quarter grew 10.2%; organic constant currency revenue grew 7%. The press release again has a table to help you see the acquisition and currency effect for each of our revenue lines.", "As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. Currency helped revenue results in the quarter by about $2 million. And total acquired revenue in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic was $19 million, including partial period contributions from G2, Sequel and LCI. Revenue from the three August acquisitions contributed $7.6 million in the quarter.", "Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue increased 12.2%. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 8.2%. Decision Analytics insurance revenue increased 16.9% in the third quarter and organic constant currency revenue growth was 13.7%. Growth was led by very strong performance in loss quantification and remote imagery with good growth in underwriting, catastrophe modeling solutions and claims analytics. The hurricane- related repair cost estimating and imagery-based solution contributed about $8 million in the quarter for Decision Analytics insurance.", "Energy and specialized markets revenue increased 2.1%. Organic constant currency revenue increased 2.2%. On an organic constant currency basis, Wood Mackenzie revenue grew about 3.3%. We are pleased to see the trends in our subscription business continuing to be positive, complemented by good consulting revenue. The customer environment remains stable and while we continue to finalize certain renewals in 2017 and early 2018, we see an encouraging business trajectory.", "Financial Services revenue increased 20.2%. Organic constant currency revenue declined 2% in the quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, we had several contracts conclude last year which contributed about $11 million in 2016. We continue to expect to see organic revenue growth in fourth quarter.", "Risk Assessment revenue grew 6.9% including contributions from our recent acquisitions which are expanding the baseline for future growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 4.9%, reflecting our 2017 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions.", "Total EBITDA increased 7.5% to $272 million. The combined cost of revenue and SG&A increased 4.9% for the quarter and 3.5% year-to-date on an organic basis as we continue to focus on efficiency in our existing businesses and re-purposing that spend to fund innovation. Acquisitions added to the expenses in the quarter and for the year.", "EBITDA margins as reported were 49.6%. Margins were reduced by about 230 basis points due to acquisitions and the related fees, an effect that we expect to continue through the year. The acquisitions we are making are close to the core with well-defined paths to top line growth and margin expansion.", "Reported interest expense was $30 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.9 billion at September 30, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.9 times. Our strong capital structure is an asset as we continue to explore opportunities to drive growth.", "Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.2%. Our tax provision in the quarter of $60 million represented an increase of 34% over 3Q 2016 where the tax rate included some one-time benefits. This was a meaningful reason for the adjusted net income growth to be down 2.3% to $141 million and adjusted EPS to be unchanged from the prior period at $0.84. Normalizing for the $2.4 million of tax, based on applying the third quarter 2017 tax rate to 2016, adjusted EPS growth would have been about 9%.", "Average diluted share count was 168 million in the quarter. We bought about 100,000 shares at an average price of $81.85. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. On September 30, 2017, our diluted share count was 167.8 million shares.", "Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $592 million for the nine months ended September 30, an increase of 22.2% versus 2016. Capital expenditures were $114 million for the nine-month period ended September 30 and CapEx was 7.2% of revenue year-to-date including investments supporting our remote imagery business. Free cash flow increased 27.5% to $478 million for the nine month period ended September. Free cash flow was 61.9% of EBITDA year-to-date.", "Across the three August acquisitions, in U.S. dollars and reflecting purchase accounting revenue haircut at Sequel, revenue in the fourth quarter should be around $17 million and EBITDA should be about $5 million. As you think about your models for 2017, we expect CapEx of about $185 million. CapEx will normalize to about 6% of revenue by 2021 after the initial remote imagery investments in 2017 and 2018, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of $135 million and amortization of intangibles of about $105 million.", "Based on our current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to be around $119 million for the year. This includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. We expect the full-year tax rate to be around 33% or possibly a little bit higher. You will note that this implies a higher tax rate in the fourth quarter as we assume a retroactive UK tax law change will take effect.", "In the adjusted net income calculation we will continue to use 26% for the tax effect on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 168 million to 169 million shares.", "We're pleased with the continuing overall improvement in revenue growth we have discussed all year. We think the opportunities for revenue growth, free cash flow generation, and prudent capital deployment remain as strong as ever. We have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term.", "We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you. First, just wanted to ask on the insurance vertical, excluding the hurricanes, the 7% growth. Is that \u2013 can you talk about what I guess, drove the acceleration in that underlying growth versus kind of 5%, 6% we had been seeing? And is that sustainable? I know you also mentioned some cyber events, I don't know if that drove kind of short-term revenue, but just talk a little bit about the sustainability of that pace of growth in insurance.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, so in reverse order, Tim, cyber didn't really contribute a lot. Think of it as a new extension of a product set that we've always had. Cyber insurance is a real thing. On the other hand, it's a fairly small line relative to the others. And most of what we do, pricing \u2013 or our revenue is going to relate to the premiums, and the premium in cyber insurance remains fairly small.", "I think the way to interpret the third quarter relative to, say, the earlier part of the year is the anomaly was more the early part of the year, where you'll remember we described some one-time effects with respect to nonrecurring revenue in 2016 that didn't recur in 2017, for example.", "So I think what you're seeing now is more kind of our normal expectation for the insurance vertical. And other than the effects of the catastrophes, there's really not anything to point at that would sort of stand out as a unique factor in the quarter that was contributing to the revenue, so we kind of feel like what we're seeing here is over time the kind of insurance-facing business that we've got.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And on the catastrophes, does any of that carry over into the fourth quarter in terms of impact on claims and kind of a short-term boost?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah, not a lot. Basically, as you would imagine, our customers are very motivated to deal with catastrophe-oriented claims very quickly and so they do actually tend to get dealt with within days of when the events actually occur, so no, not very much of that.", "Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you. On Argus, can you just help us understand, obviously there's a big improvement in the trend there in the second half. As these new customers come online or the new partnerships come online, is there a meaningful one-time revenue contribution to the second half or is this more an increase in the subscription base?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "It's both. So I think we've described for you before, that there's an interesting quality to the nature of the business related to taking all of the spend analytics we've got and pointing them towards new use cases, for example, looking at media effectiveness. And that is that there is a one-time bit of work that needs to be done to essentially integrate our platform with our customer or partner's platform and there is revenue associated with that integration. We get paid for that, but then what happens thereafter is a sustaining set of subscription revenues. So it's really at both ends.", "So yes, there will be moment in time effects associated with bringing on a substantial new customer and many of the customers we bring on are substantial, but at the same time, there is an enduring and meaningful tail of subscription revenue.", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "But I guess the question I'm trying to get at is, is the on boarding revenue going to create grow-over effects for 2018 that result in Argus growing below trend or is \u2013 I mean, you're not quantifying it or calling it out on the call. Is it there but not material enough to have a big impact?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "It's not \u2013 I mean, it is there and it's a dynamic business where we are adding customers, so there will be an effect in there, but relative to the overall performance of the business I would say not particularly material. And definitely, we need the business to continue to grow but there will be something in there but not...", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then if I could just sneak one more in. On the M&A program, obviously you continue to lean into it and see it as a source of potential value add for your shareholders. I think there's some more skepticism from some of your shareholders on the M&A program. Can you just maybe talk about how the board assesses capital allocation in terms of their review of management and your compensation programs? Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. I think you actually asked two questions in there, so we bring the program of acquisitions to the board. We go in depth through every opportunity. The effect of the board discussions is not always to affirm what it is that management has been working on, so the board is exercising discretion. With respect to, I think you were then trying to relate that to how the board interacts with us, maybe particularly me, and compensation, and the board pays me according to their view of our performance and their primary view of our performance is how do we do for our shareholders?", "Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify, Scott, to the first question I think that it was the $8 million hurricane impact that you were referring to that does not repeat beyond the quarter and I was hoping of that $8 million, I guess how much would you attribute to the remote imagery aspect of it and just curious why that wasn't an inorganic number just because I understand that it was all the assets that you acquired that allowed you to go do that post hurricane activity?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. So, first of all, yes. You heard me correctly. The $8 million is not particularly bleeding into the fourth quarter, so period, end of sentence. Most of that $8 million is related to solution sets that we've had for some time and not the remote imagery activity, and it's very straightforward on the classification of the revenues. The businesses that we acquired did not do anything in the insurance vertical. We acquired infrastructure. But in terms of actually causing business in the insurance vertical, that was entirely Verisk and existing Verisk.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And then just on WoodMac, I mean, it sounded like there was some positive developments, new products you're going to show at the Investor Day and so forth, I guess, my question is more tied to two-and-a-half years in, I was hoping you'd give us some commentary on how the sort of revenue synergies between WoodMac and insurance and so forth might be tracking?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. One of the things that you'll see at Investor Day is a synthesis of our energy data analytics and our insurance data analytics, a very exciting new product. It's really kind of in the early stages, so it's not material, where the revenue is concerned right now, but we are really, really excited about it. It's called EPICS (28:46), and you'll get a chance to see that.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just on pricing. Could you give us a sense or just an update on whether there's an opportunity to price your book of business? I know you were owned by the insurance companies and it seems like pricing is still pretty low relative to your market share and maybe just give us some color how you think about that.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. Well, the pricing for us is really a proxy for the distinctiveness of our solutions and the amount of value that we're bringing to our customers. Across everything that we do, there would be a pricing effect which relates to the strength of what it is that we do. There are some parts of our business where the pricing effect is a little bit stronger; for example, our very long-standing industry standard insurance programs. And then, other parts where it would probably be a little bit less strong, because we're more on a transaction basis in our pricing.", "But there is a price effect everywhere, and that's really no different than it's ever been. I would only \u2013 with respect to price, I would just add that we're in it for the long haul. We are making grounded decisions about how to price our solutions, because we really care about our relationships with our customers and we want them to endure and a lot of our growth opportunity is to bring new solutions, new value to our existing customers. So we feel a great burden to be responsible with how we price our products.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. And just a follow-up question. Outside of the P&C insurance universe, maybe just give us a flavor of what your exposure is to auto and personal insurance and whether you see any headwinds in that business, either from autonomous homes or vehicles. Just any sense of how you think about the world outside of P&C and whether that's a growth avenue for you or not really. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, as I think most folks know, we principally serve three vertical markets, which would be P&C insurance, retail banking and its extensions, including into retail and media effectiveness analytics, and then the whole energy complex and natural resources. And the other two parts of the business, meaning the non-P&C parts, we're very excited about them going forward. We believe both of them have sustained very strong revenue growth opportunities.", "I think you were trying to ask also about the effect of kind of like personal lines and the way that automobiles are changing and with autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles, et cetera. We actually see that as an opportunity. We actually, we believe, are the leaders in the United States in harvesting data off of connected cars. We've announced partnerships and we'll have more to announce in the future. And so it's new data basically that we can pull into our analytic methods, so we view it as an opportunity.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW. Your line is open.", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you. I wanted to know if you could provide some more detail on the aerial imagery opportunities outside of insurance. I know you mentioned insurance was a $200 million addressable market and perhaps how large the addressable market is outside the insurance sector?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, the TAM for all of the applications outside of the insurance vertical are about an order of magnitude bigger than the insurance vertical. So we talk about the insurance vertical as something, (32:58) that's sort of our home base, that's where we started from but actually, extensions into other vertical markets are going to be important to us (33:11). There is a lot of background noise. Maybe somebody's phone is unmuted (33:15).", "Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "The second question (33:20) I had was, could you just provide a bit more detail about what Sequel does and does that get rolled up into Decision Analytics?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, hi. This is Mark. Let me just provide you a little bit of insight. One, the suite of solutions that Sequel provides is really behind the scenes of all of the major carriers in London, so a little bit of a nuanced market in London and they have a captured march (33:47) there to do everything from what would be the analytics upfront from an underwriting perspective, to policy admin (33:54), to claims, even inside the reinsurance world and they have a wonderful tool that provides visual representation and a good VI to versus (34:07). So there's an analytic aspect as well (34:08). What we are going to do is we're going to invest in the VA (34:11) insurance side of things, and we think there's great opportunities to use some of those solutions to bring to maybe some of our U.S. customers on the analytic back end, which would be that visual geographic approach to things as well as the front end which is the underwriting. We also hope we can kind of supercharge some of their analytics insights inside the (34:36) solution set. So we're very excited by it. Customers are very pleased and we've gotten some very good feedback from the market in general. So we're optimistic about what we can do with Sequel.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Yes. Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Could you comment a bit on Argus' new contract with TSYS? This looks very intriguing and in particular, I'm wondering if there's any exclusivity here that might preclude you from working with other large card issuer processors like a First Data, a Fiserv, an FIS?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "No exclusivity, and in fact one of the reasons why folks like TSYS like to partner with us is because of the richness and depth of our ecosystem which creates a data asset that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world and actually, as the next partner comes in, the ecosystem gets better, so the network effect is there and the last one to come in knows that and the next one to come in knows that. So no, there's no exclusivity and it basically is a way of extending \u2013 first of all as I say, it improves the data asset but in addition to that, it actually creates yet more reach into specific banks that would be a part of TSYS's ecosystem. We're very pleased by the partnership, very excited about it.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC", "And just as a quick follow-up, is there any way to dimension the size of this contract with TSYS and potentially the size of this new market opportunity for Argus?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, we don't really put out the numbers around individual customer relationships. If you wanted to sort of do some work on that, you could sort of figure out what is TSYS's share of the processing world and try to relate that to the size of the business we are already.", "David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC", "Understood. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC. Your line is open.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to add another question on the Sequel purchase. My sense of your foray into the UK is that you bought a bunch of interesting but yet somewhat disparate assets in the past and haven't really completely integrated it all. I wonder, given the relationships there, is this an opportunity to go to market with a more consolidated or integrated approach and solution?", "And then as part of that, what's the opportunity to take analytics and things you offer here, layer that in, and drive a more meaningful revenue base from the existing customers that that business has? Or is that not really an opportunity for some reason? Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, let me start with your last question, then Mark, maybe you'd like to talk a little bit more about Sequel. I just want to interact with the premise of your question, which is the smaller acquisitions earlier in 2017 not being integrated, that's just not accurate. So just to set the record straight on that.", "But yeah, with respect to how we see the business growing globally, you can create your data analytics method pretty much anywhere. What you need to do is to make it relevant for the local market, first, by having local data sets, and second, doing whatever customization you have to do to speak into that market in exactly the way that it wants to be spoken to. So that is our view of how to grow our business, and yes, there are things that we do at Verisk today that will complement Sequel nicely.", "I'll mention, for example, our Touchstone platform on the catastrophe modeling side, and then you've got these accumulation tools on the Sequel side, and they really play together very nicely. So that work is already underway. But, Mark, do you want to kind of pick it up from there?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah, I think the other thing I'd like to highlight is there are some acquisitions, but I think this program of looking to go global is a combination of build and buy. We've been spending a lot of time and energy putting a management team in place, putting business development/sales resources that cover the world, and specifically in kind of the UK, we've done quite a bit of work with Lloyd's, we've done a lot of work with a lot of syndicates. We are building up some actual expertise.", "So we are trying to take a lot of the things we do here in the United States maybe around property, around actuarial (39:25) work, bring it to the UK. And maybe an example of this is one of the earlier acquisitions was in Ireland. It provided some underwriting information. Today, we have significantly grown and brought that to market a fuller-blown, I'll call it ISO-type of loss costs beyond just traditional rating variables.", "So we've kind of put the Verisk way into Ireland. We're trying to move that type of thinking, that type of approach, augmenting acquisitions along the way to build a platform that's substantial in the UK and beyond into Europe. So that's clearly our strategy, and I think you'll see more of that as we progress in the coming years.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. And then the follow-up, there were a series of articles after the hurricanes about insurers using their own drones to go take pictures and assess damage and reduce the dependence on people in the adjuster role. I guess is that just a good story that was easy to tell coming out of that, or is there some potential risk to, whether it's your aerial imagery or some of the other solutions from insurers beginning to do some of this stuff a bit more on their own? Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah, so the way that the imagery ecosystem works is first of all, you need to avail yourself as an insurer or an independent adjuster or an insured, of the ability to understand the asset and how it's changed. So one of the things that matters is your understanding of the asset before the event, before the damage, and so one of the things that is necessary is sort of a view of truth, which is what is there before the damage occurs? And that has to be developed both precisely in terms of the quality of the images, but also efficiently for cost reasons.", "You cannot do that with a drone. And actually, you can't do that with a satellite either. What you need is aerial imagery. That is the way to create the single view of truth in terms of what is on the ground. And that we do not see changing. So that is fundamental and foundational.", "What you do hear from some of the carriers is that in the wake of an event, if an adjuster can get to the building, because remember, the radius in which you can fly a drone is very limited, then one of the ways that you can assess the property in addition to visually inspecting it as a human being, is to operate a drone. And some of the companies have begun to do that. So they literally would have some of their adjusters driving around with a small drone in their trunk.", "It's really kind of a technical augmentation of what an adjuster has always done, which is to try to get close to the property and understand what happened to it. It really does not represent very much change. The adjusters may find that using the drone, they can do their work a little bit faster, they can maybe be a little bit more precise, they can drive better images and we're all for it actually. We are able to provide a turnkey drone solution to our customers as well and actually, one where the homeowner is actually sort of operating \u2013 if they have access to a drone, they can actually direct and capture the images and get those back to us. So that development is a good one. It's not an overwhelming one. It hasn't really changed the nature of the claims process, maybe into the future it will have somewhat more effect, but the fundamental point is if you're going to do these analytics at scale, you're not going to do them with drones.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. That's helpful.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Morning, Bill.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Morning.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So a question for you on the EBITDA margins. The guidance had been that the second half margins were going to be flat with Q2 and Q3 had come in 100 basis points ahead of that. I understand we've had the extreme weather benefit. I just wanted to ask how we should think about margins heading into Q4 and into 2018.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. Thanks, Bill. Well, I think you hit the nail on the head when you talked about the margin in the quarter and certainly one of the benefits of our business model is we have nice incremental margins and certainly, we saw some of that in terms of the storm benefit.", "We also had the impact on our margins that we've discussed which is around the acquisitions. So those will be a little bit of a pulldown on the margins as we think about sort of the fourth quarter. We have brought in the new acquisitions. We gave you some very specific numbers around how much those will contribute in the fourth quarter, that's sort of call it roughly a 30% margin based on what we've said. Those margins will scale over time, but I think as you kind of put that all together, I would say that we did have an outperformance versus expectation in margins in the third quarter because of some of the storm benefit. So I would \u2013 as you think about your model for the fourth quarter, I would put those other factors back in and certainly we look to drive margins, but there will be probably more of a pulldown, than a pullup in fourth quarter.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And a quick follow up if I may. A housekeeping question on the revenue impact from the extreme weather. You mentioned the $8 million and having it giving a couple point benefit to the insurance piece. I just want to make sure my math is right. If the constant currency organic for the third quarter was 7.0%, it looked like 160 basis points coming from that, the extreme weather benefit, so that would mean about 5.4% versus the 4.1% in Q2. Is that about right?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You are spot on, Bill.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right. And then the context there is should we think that \u2013 should we expect Q4 to be \u2013 the organic growth to be higher versus that 5.4% normalized level?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. So as you know, Bill, we don't get into specific quarterly guidance throughout the year, we do express (46:16) in terms of our growth rates and I think you've seen that so far.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Well excellent. Thank you very much.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you, Bill.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. I wanted to jump back into aerial imaging revenues in the organic for DA insurance. If it wasn't for the hurricane effect, would aerial imaging be moving the revenue needle in the third quarter and then because I thought it's still kind of nascent business? And then the second part of my question is you indicated aerial imaging acquisitions added $15 million of revenues. Could you give us a sense of how big your Geomni revenues in total are right now including your prior internally-built base?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I think both those questions are aimed at the same point, Andrew, and I'll just say that the Geomni business in the insurance vertical is growing and would have grown even absent the effect of the extreme weather, and growing very, very nicely. So there was a boost in the quarter as I said before of that $8 million, most of it was not attributable to Geomni, but pre-existing Verisk solutions. So Geomni is growing nicely. It's sort of getting to a scale where we can almost begin to not call it nascent anymore, even though we're still early in the journey. But it is growing, and would have grown, and would have grown nicely in the third quarter even absent the extreme weather effect.", "Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe this actually relates to the prior question, and I've asked this before, but when I look at your Q and the disclosures there about subscription and non-subscription, in Decision Analytics it continues to stand out that the non-subscription line is growing really rapidly. I think it was like 38% year over year if I back into that right or $27 million. So I guess the question is one, what is driving that non-subscription growth? Is it all aerial imagery for example? And then secondly, can you give an organic subscription number for the quarter in Decision Analytics? Because that continues to look a little bit anemic.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. So the reason that the growth shows that we're \u2013 or let me make a more general point as we sort of get into this topic, which is that customers often have a preference for how they buy solutions, particularly new solutions, which is that they prefer to get into it in a transaction mode rather than in a subscription mode, because they don't exactly know how much of it they're going to need. And we're happy to do business that way as we're moving into a category which is either new for them or it's at least new for us with respect to serving them. So we don't consider transaction-based revenues to be low quality revenues, because they very frequently mature, they ripen into subscription agreements. So for example, in the Geomni world \u2013 and I'm just taking that as an example, today we're transaction-priced.", "One of the plans that we have worked on at length has been as our offerings begin to mature, one of the ways that we can offer them to customers would be in more of a subscription mode, where you would essentially sort of be kind of buying the aerial imagery platform I guess is the way I would say it, without respect to any individual property that you want to look at. So that would be an example of there would be a progressive movement of what today is booked as transaction revenue into what tomorrow or down the road would be booked as subscription revenue. And that's kind of a normal effect inside of a data analytics business. It's very common for the customers to want to start out in a transaction mode.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah, and, Alex, I was just going to add to that. I think, when you look at the growth rates, certainly the transactional growth rates were higher than the subscription growth rates in the third quarter and actually, in the second quarter as well. But if you actually look at the progression in that growth, you would see the subscription \u2013 the relativity subscription growth has accelerated quite a bit as well as has transactional.", "And remember, because we are 80% subscription, the dollars associated with that acceleration of subscription growth are really what's meaningfully driving the growth. I don't have the organic numbers in front of me, but I would say that generally some of the businesses that we're bringing in are a lot more transactional in terms of that. So I think if you were to parse that out of your transactional growth rate but down to organic, I think you would see a bit more balance. Although nonetheless, we have storm activity and so transactions, as Scott said, is good revenue. So we'll take that.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "That's very helpful color. Thank you very much. Just secondly real quick, you mentioned the hurricane or weather impact will bleed into the fourth quarter, which is good, but how should I be thinking about this more longer term? Because this was, I think, a more extreme event than we've seen in years. Like where could there be incremental demand longer term? For example, maybe you will see some premium acceleration in some parts of the business, should that drive more, or better end market? Will you see more subscription on aerial? Or maybe some models that change and people have to purchase. What's the longer-term discussions with customers potentially coming out of this, kind of like very extreme time?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "There are three things to keep in your mind. I'll touch on the first two and Mark will pick up on the third. First of all, we said that the third quarter extreme events don't bleed into the fourth quarter with respect to revenue, so just hopefully everybody heard that and heard that clearly. The second thing to just sort of know about our business and obviously, we're talking here about insurance. We are very excited about where we're going in financial services and in the energy complex and I just want to continue to put that out there.", "But in the insurance space, the anomaly has been the amount of time that has passed since the last major event, so you can basically go back and say you have Sandy in 2011 and then you had Katrina and the unusual thing is sort of the spacing in there, actually. So when you think about Verisk, one of the things that you should think about is that part of what we do for our customers is provide a whole suite of solutions which help them to be hardened against major events.", "Major events happen. They happen not every year. We've actually been in an extended period where they didn't really happen with any frequency but that's the anomaly and so it is a part of our business. It won't show up every year. We'll see what the pattern is \u2013 and by the way, extreme event does not necessarily mean a hurricane, so there's also a sensitivity to for example, things like major flooding events in the United States, but they may not be atmospherically driven in the same way that a hurricane is, so you've got all that. But now having said those two things, I think what we also want you to just understand is sort of the very balanced way in which our insurance-facing business is growing. It's related to a lot of things, claims and new software platforms and so Mark if you want to just talk about that a little bit?", "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Just, I think to your question a couple things that typically help us a little bit in the future (54:36) is an event like these our insurer and reinsurer customers take some additional thoughts around how and what they're going to do with regard to cat modeling, so there could be opportunities for AIR down the road, to the extent that someone (54:50) wants a second model and maybe a more comprehensive suite of solutions whether it's across different perils, or different geographies, that's an opportunity.", "What we've also talked about sometimes with catastrophes is that it does help pricing in the industry. From a primary perspective I don't think we're going to see a big upsurge in pricing. From a rate perspective reinsurance, it should bolster maybe reinsurance a little bit. That helps our customers' customers who are growing have more of an appetite to buy things. So that's maybe just another tertiary benefit to us, but just wanted to share those other observations. I think that's what maybe you were searching for as well.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "Yes. Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking our questions. We just thought with some of the production capacity going offline for a little bit from the storms, could you see that having any impact to energy CapEx spending at all in 2018 and if that would have any effect on the business?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "No. No, the nature of the business in the south central United States is a very engineering-intense way of extracting hydrocarbons from the ground and basically in the unconventional space for example, you can get your well established within three to five days, so it's a blip.", "Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. Got it. And with all the acquisitions, the leverage ratio going up a little bit. Do you have a ceiling with how high you would go with the leverage ratio to complete the more necessary acquisitions?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So yes, so we have stated curbs and Eva maybe you just want to describe those?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, I mean we've talked about our reference point being 2.5 times debt to EBITDA but we'll go above that for the opportunities. We've done that in the past. The way we really think about it is we don't really \u2013 we have covenants, those aren't really a constraint for us. So for us, the measure is really how long does it take us to de-lever and I think if you look at our business, especially in Q1, we generate a lot of free cash flow. So I would expect that that ratio would come down relatively quickly absent spending that cash on any other opportunities. So we feel very comfortable we've got a lot of flexibility.", "Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hey. Good morning. It's Henry Chien on for Jeff. I just had a follow-up on the aerial imagery product, or products, I should say. In terms of the time line of the rollout to customers, I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of that, and when we can see at least a meaningful impact on growth in the insurance segment or business line.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "It's in the market now and impacting our growth rate now.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And in terms of the acquisition multiples, could you give us a sense on what those levels are for the aerial imagery acquisitions?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I don't think we really \u2013 the aerial imagery acquisitions? I mean, I think, Eva, remind me, but I think we actually talked about 2-ish million dollars of acquired EBITDA at the time that we bought the seven smallish regional imaging companies.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And in terms of the multiples? How have they trended so far?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "So we paid $30 million...", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "$31 million.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Pardon me?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "$31 million.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "$31 million for those businesses.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you. Hey, just post the Equifax breach, are you seeing any step-up in demand around kind of authorization and kind of pre-approval as it relates to Argus?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Authorization and pre-approval of Argus. I'm not quite sure what you're asking.", "Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Scott, in terms of trying to manage fraud, fraud detection early, kind of in a pre-approval process or at the point of authorization, are you seeing any potential step-up in demand from clients?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, the demand factors for Argus are very good, but that's not \u2013 if I'm understanding your question, that's not really what Argus does.", "Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right, but is \u2013 I guess, so let me ask, is that a potential area that you could potentially get into?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You mean to help companies \u2013 help banks, for example, with their cybersecurity?", "Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "That is potentially something that we could do at Verisk. That is not something that we do today. We do work on cyber insurance, so we help insurers think about how to manage their insurance products, but actually hardening companies, including banks, against cyber-attack is not something that we do today, though potentially something that we could consider doing in the future.", "Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in, and appreciate all the color on the natural disasters and other events and so forth. My question is a little more granular on the acquisition strategy, particularly when I look at G2 and Lundquist (01:00:42). I think a little bit about what the bureaus are doing for banks and perhaps TransUnion in particular, and I just wonder if you can comment on whether or not you think your business is sort of moving into adjacencies to what has been a traditional bureau offering, or how you think about differentiating your financial services offerings generally.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes, I think that \u2013 let me take it in reverse order. So Argus is a beautiful business that is founded on a data set that is utterly unique. And the data set is unique because of the granularity of the data that is being contributed by a wide \u2013 a large, wide and growing number of companies that participate in this consortium where they're contributing data. We do our analysis and decision support and provide it back to them.", "And so that whole ecosystem is growing and strengthening, and that is the fundamental foundation of the growth of Argus. And we are finding our ways into new use cases related to that content. So for example, when you think about G2, a lot of what G2 does is to diligence merchants. To date, most of the application of the data set has been more about diligencing consumers, the borrower and then to \u2013 and observe what they're doing in terms of their spending, using their credit card product for example, or their debit products. But one of the things that you can do when your data set is as comprehensive as ours is, is you can also then sort of pivot and start to try to observe the activities of the merchants where these payment products are being used. That's kind of new business for us relatively, and G2 is already there and so that's where the synergy occurs on that side.", "Then with respect to looking more at sort of LCI, another thing that you can do when you have comprehensive transaction data, is you can try to understand patterns of fraud, which is a really great theme for us, one that's very important for us in the insurance world for example. That's something that we have already done inside of Argus. It's a small part of what we do at Argus today but it's available and LCI helps supercharge that.", "When you move more towards the sort of the merchant analytics, there can be a degree of overlap with players out there including the bureaus and when you move towards trying to root out fraud, there's kind of a different set of solution providers out there that you might end up overlapping a little bit but we believe that, back to the most important point, we believe we come very equipped for these new categories because of the depth of what we've already got. And so we feel advantaged in trying to bring new value to the market with respect to categories like merchants and fraud.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then Eva, I just missed it, a housekeeping standpoint. What was the intangible amortization comment for this year?", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "The intangible amortization for this year is $105 million.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Nicholas Verhein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. This is Nick Verhein on for Anj. Thanks for taking my question. Could you maybe just give us a sense of what the WoodMac contribution was to your energy and specialized markets revenue growth in the quarter?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "I think we put that out there. It was 3.3%.", "Nicholas Verhein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Oh, okay, I must have just missed that. Can you just maybe then provide an update on maybe some of the customer conversations or maybe some sentiment, what it's sort of trending like and any updated thoughts on what sort of growth the business can aspire to in the sort of stable to low oil price environment?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, first of all, just to observe on the environment, I think maybe you noticed that Brent closed at $61-something yesterday, so there's been actually fair progression in terms of the price of the commodity. We said for some time we just need the environment to be stable for our customers to feel good and to lean into growing their businesses and doing so by doing business with us and we feel like we're now in that environment, so we're actually very pleased about that.", "Customer conversations are very good. I mean, it's a large global dynamic space and probably every customer of ours in that space has their own story in terms of where they are on their journey towards growth and profitability and part of the reason why we're both a meaningful partner for them, and also we feel like we have really terrific opportunities, is that we have these intimate relationships with essentially all of them and so we're able to turn corners with them specifically. Where are they trying to get to?", "And just like everything else we do, our business there also has a motive quality because we have data assets that are absolutely unique, so we feel very strongly about this business and are very excited about where it's going. I said at the time we bought it, and I still say, that over intermediate and long periods of time I'm looking for Wood Mackenzie to grow faster than the average of Verisk and we believe that's very possible, probable.", "Nicholas Verhein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Thank you for the ACV commentary on WoodMac. Did want to ask about how renewal rates have trended? And then also, did you offer any price concessions to clients during the downturn? As you are doing your planning around next year, are you planning for price increases on those products?", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yes. We've actually talked about this effect before, so just to sort of reprise what we said before, WoodMac does a \u2013 at WoodMac we do a mix of one, two and three-year subscriptions. So part of what gets reported right at this moment is actually what was set in motion a couple years ago. And there were contracts that were being written and renewed kind of in the depth of sort of the pressure on the category. So when we report the 5-plus percent ACV progression year-to-date, it actually takes a little while for that to work its way into the reported results. And so as you're watching Wood Mackenzie step up, and we've talked about this for several quarters now, it's because these good things that are happening, they just take a while to get expressed into the overall result. So you're seeing WoodMac elevate. I think, 2018 looks very interesting for WoodMac.", "David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then on acquisitions, I understand they are a 230 basis points drag to your EBITDA margins in the quarter. In terms of thinking about a time line to narrow that gap, is a two-year period too aggressive? Could you do it faster or slower? What's a rule of thumb to use? Thank you.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Well, if you were to look at for example, the three acquisitions we did in Q3, which are 75% of the spend that we've done in 2017, I think that you would definitely expect them within 12 to 18 months to essentially be sort of looking like they will look like at their run rates. And in all cases, I think you're then talking about a difference to the corporate margin level, which is much, much lower than that 230 basis point effect that we were \u2013 that we've talked. The 230 basis points, Eva was trying to help you understand Q4 of 2017 but these are highly profitable businesses.", "Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Yeah, I would also add, there are some one-time effects when we acquire businesses. There's some fees associated with that. There's some accounting associated with certain revenue. So that's going to be more of a near-term weight on those businesses as well. So I think as Scott said, we're positive in terms of those ramping up.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "All three of those businesses have the same quality as the rest of Verisk, which is to say, a high degree of fixed costs and so incremental margins in all of those businesses are really good.", "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.", "Okay. Seeing no other questioners on the screen there, I'll just say thank you very much for your time and your interest today. We look forward to seeing you. Hope you can all join us at our Investor Day in December. And as I mentioned right up front, we'll spend even more time on some of these newer parts of the company so that you have a very, very deep understanding of what they are, and how they behave in the market and how they behave economically. So hope you can join us then. Thanks for your time today.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Lee Shavel. Mr. Shavel, you may go ahead.", "Lee Shavel", "Thank you, Heidi, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our fourth quarter 2017 financial results. With me on this call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and myself highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. ", "Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, for which you can find a reconciliation in our press release. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. ", "A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect the future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. ", "Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.", "Scott Stephenson", "Thank you, and good morning. It's a real pleasure to welcome Lee to his first earnings call as Verisk's new CFO. Lee's experience and insight from his time as NASDAQ CFO are already contributing to developments at Verisk. One of the first jobs he and I agreed on was for him to do a listening tour of some of our major institutional shareholders to hear your candid feedback about your likes and dislikes for owning Verisk is concerned. This has been the healthy exercise we expected, and we believe your feedback will be expressed in our evolving policies and communication practices in the coming quarters. Lee has already been able to complete an annual budget cycle with us, and so he has quickly become grounded in the rudiments of our business. ", "As we described in our recent Investor Day, Verisk advances by achieving strong levels of organic revenue growth, and the primary driver of high-quality organic revenue is the sale of multiyear subscriptions. A multiyear subscription is the best demonstration that our solutions have moved from nice to have to must-have. Over the last 90 days, there have been several encouraging developments, to name three, First, Argus acquired a large multiyear subscription agreement along with the associated data rights with the only major credit card issuer in the English-speaking world that was not a customer. Second, WoodMac saw good progress in the number and value of subscription agreement signed. And third, in the insurance vertical, against a backdrop of many contract signings, we had 3 companies choose to focus exclusively on our catastrophe models and saw 2 other companies make an exclusive commitment to our Geomni program of imagery capture and analysis. But perhaps most important of all, we have the chance to see the value of our industry standard solutions tested in the context of the merger of 2 carriers and are very pleased with the degree to which our value and subscription price points stood the test as we finalized that new agreement. ", "Subscriptions, of course, can cut both ways. When they are lost, it takes even more sales success to compensate and grow. In 2017, we had such conditions at work at Argus, where 2 government and 1 legacy subscription agreement rolled off with a reduction of about $11 million in annual revenue. As we assess our business into 2018, we observed the following across our several thousand customers, we see no material risk at this time of a lost customer relationship in the insurance and financial services verticals. And in energy, two accounts that produced subscription revenue in '17 will be combined into one as a result of a merger with relatively immaterial impacts. The substantial majority of our customer relationships are showing year-over-year increases in revenue related primarily to the adoption of more of our product suite. We are aware of only two accounts, one in financial services and one in energy, where we expect year-over-year revenues to be down materially in 2018.", "In the financial services example, this is due to the phenomenon we have previously described, where first year revenue spike due to implementation, thereafter followed by a steady but lower level of high-quality subscription revenue. In the case of energy, the customer no longer exists due to merger. ", "Our industry-standard solutions will show growth in 2018, but at a slightly lower rate than in '17. Because of general softness in the insurance environment and to preserve our cross-sell opportunities, we deliberately moderated growth for '18 to a modest degree. However, we see hardening in the market, and we expect that in '19 we will be at or above the growth rate of '17. ", "WoodMac growth continues to move to the positive. In '18, the growth will primarily relate to cross-selling and expansion of exciting product sets, including subsurface analytics, renewable energy sources and chemicals. We are still minimizing price increases in '18 in support of cross-selling opportunities, but expect the '19 and beyond to make more use of pricing in our overall growth mix. ", "One of the best leading indicators of our organic revenue growth is the number and quality of meetings we had with senior decision makers at our customers, in which we explore new opportunities for value creation. In that context, it is encouraging that in the last 90 days, we, on 3 occasions, had company CEOs asked to bring themselves and their senior teams to our offices to observe Verisk's InsureTech and jointly develop new or bespoke solutions. ", "Another leading indicator that has meaning for me is our success in winning business with the newer entrants into the markets we serve. For example, the world is alive with interest in the InsureTech space. Of the 8 leading InsureTech firms founded in '16 and '17 that operate as risk-bearing or risk-managing entities, 6 of them are currently customers of Verisk. I take that as evidence of the freshness of our value proposition. ", "We're busy at work integrating the companies we acquired in 2017. The work of integration have 3 different flavors at this moment, first, we acquired seven regional image capture companies with the intent to merge them into one integrated national entity. Success in this endeavor is really entirely a function of integration since this is core to the value proposition. I'm pleased with our progress here. At the end of last year, with all the extreme weather events, the flexibility and integration of our operations was tested. And I was pleased to see that the quality and responsiveness of our image capture, which is driven by the integration of our platform, permitted us to image Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria with such speed and precision that we unlocked business with mortgage lenders who were not previously customers.", "At the other end of the spectrum, PowerAdvocate and Sequel are relatively mature organizations, where, in addition to financial and HR integration, the primary work is to link their platforms to those elsewhere in Verisk. Specifically, PowerAdvocate to WoodMac oil and gas analytics and Sequel to AIR's Touchstone modeling platform. Teams are well underway on this work. In fact, we've recently signed a major contract with one of the world's largest national oil companies, which involves deliverables on the part of both PowerAdvocate and WoodMac. Both teams report this sale would not have happened had the 2 companies not come together. ", "The third category is a series of smaller product organizations, most of them in insurance, where the immediate work is to harness the Verisk distribution channel to increase sales. We are well underway with this work. ", "At our recent Investor Day, I described the 5 qualities that make our company a moated business, which can produce strong organic revenue growth on a sustained basis, those being, one, vertical market expertise; two, unique datasets, ideally contributed by our customers; three, deep integration with customer workflows; four, global reach leading to an expanding customer account; and five, synergies arising from the sharing of methods and capabilities across our enterprise. I see progress on all fronts. And over the last 90 days, I'm particularly struck by our growing effectiveness in overseas markets, particularly the U.K. As a result, our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 7.6%, consistent with our longer-term goals. Our rate of organic EBITDA growth in the quarter was about 5%, lower than revenue growth and a function, particularly, of the significant investment we made in Geomni as we continue to ramp up that operation. In 2018, I expect that relationship to be reversed, meaning enterprise organic EBITDA growth greater than organic revenue growth. ", "I'd like to comment on the corporate tax reform that was enacted at the end of 2017. Lee will take you through the specific implications for Verisk as regards our tax rate and the after-tax cash flow and accounting implications. From a strategic perspective, we are treating this as an opportunity to reinvest in our people. And so we have taken the decision to double our training budgets in most categories and to materially increase our contributions to long-term wealth for our people in the form of greater 401(k) matching and expanded employee stock purchase programs. We have built all of these investments into our 2018 budget and still expect a strong bottom line this year. After the additional free cash, we intend to be disciplined with our investor's money, looking for the highest-return investment opportunities and looking favorably on opportunities to return capital to shareholders. ", "With that, I'll hand it over to Mark for some comments on the insurance business.", "Mark Anquillare", "Thank you, Scott. In our insurance business, we had another strong quarter, with all insurance-facing businesses, industry standard programs, catastrophe modeling, repair cost estimating, planes analytics and remote imagery contributing to the growth. ", "Let me highlight a few areas that drove top line growth and update you on several initiatives to aggregate new sources of data to better position us for growth in the future. Our claims businesses, repair cost estimating and claims analytics experienced a nice uptick in growth in the second half of 2017. We have been successful expanding our insurance fraud prevention business, claims analytics, by broadening our use cases, aggregating additional information, licensing our antifraud analytic tools and extending beyond our traditional insurance customers to entities such as self-insured companies and third-party administrators. In most cases, these opportunities take the form of multiyear contracts, but in some instances, start as a paid proof of concept. We're optimistic about these extensions of our business. ", "We've also experienced a surge in opportunities in our workers' compensation solutions business, bringing on several major new accounts during 2017. Over the past couple of years, we've invested to provide increased automation and enhanced [indiscernible] to our customers. This investment has proven successful as we implement new customers and attract a growing sales pipeline. ", "During the fourth quarter, Geomni, our business that harnesses remote sensing and machine learning technologies to provide information about residential and commercial structures, deployed one of its regional hubs to proactively capture aerial imagery in response to the Southern California fires. Imagery collected helps document the areas affected, provide operational efficiencies and accelerate the damage estimation and restoration process for homes and commercial buildings, helping insurers protect people and property. As Scott mentioned in his earlier comments, we have made significant progress at Geomni, signing new customers, advancing the analytics and building geographic coverage. ", "We were thrilled to sign an exclusive agreement with Honda to join the Verisk Data Exchange in the quarter. Honda will provide Verisk with driving data from consenting owners of Honda's connected cars. Honda customers can access the Verisk Driving Score, a simple metric that rates the driving behavior. Insurers can use the data from the Verisk Data Exchange with their usage-based insurance programs, typically designed to reward safe drivers or use Verisk driver behavior scores that are filed and approved for use today in 43 states. With the addition of Honda, the total market share of automakers participating in the Verisk Data Exchange increased to 27% of vehicles sold in the United States. The exchange now has close to 3 million cars, with 30 billion miles of driving data. And it's growing at more than 150,000 vehicles each month. This telematics information is a key component of our broader mission to aggregate remote sensing information and find insights to help our customers. This remote sensing data includes information from mobile devices, connected homes, connected buildings. For example, with connected homes, our research using IoT data has shown opportunities for Lyft or improved underwriting results for our customers writing homeowners' insurance. ", "International expansion is an important part of our long-term growth plan. AIR continues to lead our international expansion efforts as PICC Reinsurance Company Limited, a leading Chinese reinsurance company, has collaborated with AIR to better assess and manage its growing portfolio of catastrophe risk reinsurance business. Another positive on the international front was our introduction of a new inland flood model for Japan, along with enhancements to our Japan typhoon model. The integration of our new international acquisitions has progressed smoothly. The newly acquired businesses have gained immediate benefit by leveraging Verisk's technology infrastructure and cloud capabilities.", "Specific to Sequel, we work conjointly with clients to enable seamless data transfer from Sequel's business intelligence tools to AIR's Touchstone Solutions. In the longer term, our goal is to integrate Sequel's front-end exposure management and visualization platform with ISO's underwriting information and portfolio assessment and modeling features of AIR. This modular approach will allow product cross-sell with Sequel customers as well as existing Verisk customers. Our integration efforts at Sequel are also working in 2 directions, as evidenced by an opportunity for our claims analytics business to leverage some existing Sequel software to serve our U.S. claims analytics customers. ", "All in all, both qualitatively and quantitatively, we are pleased with the performance of the insurance business. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.", "Lee Shavel", "Thanks, Mark. Let me start by saying what an honor it is for me to be here and to have the opportunity to serve this great company and its shareholders and work with Scott and his management team. As Scott mentioned, I've had the opportunity in the past 2 months to meet or speak directly with 18 of our top 25 active investors, representing 50% of the active voting interest of our shareholders. We spoke about a wide variety of topics, and I've received many thoughtful perspectives, but 2 areas came up consistently, one, a desire to better understand our capital management discipline; and two, improve transparency and communication of our financial and operating performance. In both areas, I'm confident that we'll demonstrate improvements in 2018. And to that end, we'll be implementing a quarterly earnings presentation for the first quarter of 2018 that will provide a consistent structure for reviewing the company's performance across our business lines, and we are considering other enhancements based on the feedback I've received. ", "Moving to the financial results for the quarter. I'd like to start by focusing at a high level on the two key financial metrics that we discussed at Investor Day, organic revenue growth and organic EBITDA growth. Verisk demonstrated very solid growth performance and momentum in the fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth of 7.6%, 7.4% on a constant-currency basis, was consistent with our long-term guidance and was an increase in the comparable third quarter 2017 year-over-year growth of 6.5% or 7% on a constant-currency basis. Average quarterly organic growth on a constant-currency basis in the second half of 2017 of 7.2% compared to 3.3% for the first half, substantiating the expectation we had of acceleration in the second half. ", "I would note total acquired revenue in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic was $26 million and revenue from the 3 August acquisitions, G2, Sequel and LCI, contributed $16 million in the quarter, with combined margins of around 36%, as expected. ", "For the full year, Verisk delivered organic revenue growth of 4.5% and 5.3% on a constant-currency basis, below our targeted level as the result of industry headwinds at WoodMac and the contract expirations at Argus that reduced revenues from 2016, particularly in the first half. ", "A quick side note on revenue accounting and as required, the company will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, in the first quarter of 2018. We expect the impact to be immaterial to our financial results. ", "So breaking down the organic revenue growth. As you will see in Table 2 in the press release, Decision Analytics and, particularly, Decision Analytics insurance was the primary contributor to this organic growth at 12.9%, with strong growth in repair cost estimating and claims analytics solutions, with good growth in underwriting solutions also. The positive financial impact of severe weather on our business in the third quarter spilled over into the fourth quarter and contributed about $8 million in repair cost estimating and imagery-based solution revenue. Even excluding this revenue, organic insurance revenue growth was 8.2%. ", "Decision Analytics energy demonstrated an improvement to 5.2% organic growth in the fourth quarter, up from 0.2% in the third quarter. Given the currency impact for energy, principally WoodMac, I would note that, on a constant-currency basis, energy revenue growth was 4.7% and has increased for each of the prior 3 quarters. We are pleased to see the trends in our subscription business continuing to be positive, complemented by good consulting revenue number, which is typically a leading market indicator. ", "At Decision Analytics financial services, they delivered growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter, which represented a reversal from the prior 3 quarters of year-over-year decreases as a result of contract expirations. Organic growth was driven by strength in analytical data warehousing products, share of wallet model algorithms and media effectiveness solutions. We continue to win significant new business with clients, as Scott described, in media effectiveness, analytical solutions, competitive benchmarking, decisioning algorithms and regulatory solutions. G2 and LCI continue to integrate well, with joint product roadshows underway, which have been well received by clients. Fintellix has also contributed by driving new products in the insurance sector. We believe that financial services demonstrated clear progress in the fourth quarter, and we remain confident that it will contribute to organic growth in 2018. ", "Risk Assessment generated 5.3% year-over-year growth for the period, also up from 4.9% in the third quarter and having steadily increased over each of the 4 quarters in 2017. Organic growth was driven by the annual effective growth in 2017 invoices as well as new solutions in industry-standard insurance programs and an increase in underwriting solutions subscription revenue. ", "Organic EBITDA growth was 4.9% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis compared to organic revenue growth of 7.6% and reflected organic cost of revenue and SG&A expense growth of 9.7% as the result of continued investment in several internal opportunities, including Geomni most notably. For the year, EBITDA growth was 4% over 2016 compared to organic revenue growth of 4.5% as the result of 5.2% full year growth in the cost of revenue and SG&A, also reflecting continued internal investment in several growth opportunities and organic revenue growth below targets at Argus and WoodMac relative to expense growth. ", "Excluding the impact of expense related to internal investment initiatives, organic EBITDA grew at a higher rate than the organic revenue growth in 2017.

On an organic basis, EBITDA margin was essentially unchanged. ", "Depreciation and amortization was $64 million in the quarter, up 25 -- I'm sorry, up 28% from the prior year quarter and $237 million for 2017, up 12% from 2016, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and increased capital expenditures in both periods. We expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $150 million to $160 million and amortization of intangible assets of about $130 million in 2018.

Our leverage at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.7x, and we expect to bring our leverage back to our reference level of 2.5x over time. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $142 million at the end of 2017. ", "Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 14.1% and a positive 19.7% for the full year of 2017. These effective rates reflect an $89 million benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities resulting from recently enacted tax legislation. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 21% and 23%. ", "Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.34 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.80 in the prior year quarter and $3.74 for 2017, up from $3.11 in 2016. The increase in both periods primarily reflects, naturally, the impact of 2017 tax reform. Excluding the tax reform benefit of $0.53 per share in the fourth quarter, diluted adjusted EPS was $0.81 for the quarter, up 1% from the prior year, and $3.21 for 2017, up 3% from 2016.

We anticipate capital expenditures to be between $220 million and $230 million in 2018, including the continued investments in our aerial imagery solutions at Geomni that will peak in 2018. Subsequently, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenues to steadily decline.

Both businesses demonstrated revenue progress in the second half, with strong performance in our insurance business, helped in part by revenue generated by an exceptional level of severe weather in the third quarter. We returned to our targeted organic revenue growth in the second half of 2017. We remain confident in our long-term organic growth targets, particularly if growth continues to improve at both WoodMac and Argus as we saw in the second half. We are pleased with our 2018 plan. We're excited about the opportunities to invest, looking to drive long-term profitable growth. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long term. ", "We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company.", "Timothy McHugh", "Can I ask about the comment, first, related to industry standard programs? I guess, one, just elaborate on why, I guess, take a little bit more cautious approach to, it sounded like, pricing, essentially. Because I think in the past you've talked about kind of the -- your pricing capability being somewhat separate from the kind of the environment for the insurance industry. So maybe just elaborate on what drove that. And anything about how significant that might be in terms of the [indiscernible] program?", "Scott Stephenson", "Thank you, Tim. Let me start with the end. It's not a particularly significant effect, but of course, folks will be watching our year-over-year progression as we go through 2018. So we have visibility into this, so we just wanted to note it. It's not a very material effect. We're talking about basis points. And the reason that we did it was that we've just in the round have accounted for where our insurance customers were as they exited '17, there -- the state of their own businesses. And the most important thing in the growth of our insurance business by far, and I hope that's evident to everybody, is the cross-selling of our total suite of solutions. And so, essentially, we made a decision about where we're going to take our gains in 2018. And at the margin, we're leaning a little bit more towards the other parts of the suite facing our insurance customers. So we just wanted to note it for you. It's not a big effect at all. We wanted to call it out just because it's a line item that we report, but it's not highly material.", "Timothy McHugh", "Okay. And just to be clear, that's driven by -- just that you were talking about industry standard, not the broader insurance kind of including Decision Analytics and so forth?", "Scott Stephenson", "That's correct. I was only talking about our industry standard line item within the overall insurance suite. The -- we feel very good about the overall insurance business.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.", "Jeffrey Meuler", "So just on the comment about organic EBITDA margins expanding in 2018, I guess, just two related questions. So is that before the reinvestment of some of the tax savings? And if so, can you just help size up roughly the magnitude of the reinvestment? And then can you also just give us any sense of the acquisition effect on 2018 margins? There's a lot of moving pieces with acquired/deferred revenue headwinds and some prior acquisitions being anniversaried in that regard in 2017 transaction expenses. So I guess the first question is, on the organic revenue -- or organic margin outlook, does it include the reinvestment? And then if you can help us size up those two pieces, please.", "Scott Stephenson", "Right, thanks, Jeff. I'll start, then I'll bump it over to Lee. So with respect to the statement about the projection of organic EBITDA exceeding that of organic revenue, that is before any tax effects whatsoever. So that is net of all the investing that we're doing in the business in total. And so hopefully, that's responsive to your question. With respect to some of the detail underneath, Lee, do you want to add anything to all that?", "Lee Shavel", "Yes. Jeff, so I think part of the question is prior to the reinvestment of the tax benefits. And so I think our expectation for the organic EBITDA growth reflects kind of the core business as we are looking at the investment in the growth initiatives. We expect that, that will contribute to margin expansion over time as we reach the fruition on those investments. But as I indicated in my comments, when you exclude those investments, we saw, in 2017, actually an expansion of organic EBITDA margin. And that's where we're really focused currently is, one, what does the -- how is the core performance? How is the core business performing? Secondly, how are the investments performing? And then with regard to acquisitions, what we had provided is the impact of acquisitions in the fourth quarter. It's difficult to predict the overall impact of the acquisitions on the margin over time.", "We'd like to focus on that organic EBITDA margin because that's really what we're managing to. Naturally, as we make acquisitions, as you've seen from some of the disclosures, at their level of EBITDA margin, initially, that will have a dilutive impact, but what we're really focused on is that year-over-year improvement that we will see once those businesses come into the organic fold. So hopefully, that gives you some color on the organic EBITDA margin question.", "Jeffrey Meuler", "That's helpful. And then on the Argus -- or financial services organic outlook, I think there was a moment at the Investor Day where there's a question about should 2018 be an outsized growth year. And I think, Scott, you said it was your expectation, that Nana was nodding his head yes. And then there was a comment today about, I think, a grow-over effect from the onetime revenue in '17 as in -- a large new client comes online. So is the expectation, even including that 2018 Argus, has an outsized organic growth year?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes, it is.", "Operator", "Yes, your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik", "The first question, just broadly on, I guess, organic revenue growth in '18. Scott, you answered a lot of, I guess, moving pieces and comments. And I think, in insurance, you said 2019 would be bigger than '17. I was wondering if I heard that correctly. Just in the context, Lee, you also walked through -- obviously, second half in line with the long-term organic growth, a range that you'd set out. So I guess, just trying to put those all moving pieces you laid out in front of the call, how should we think of '18 exactly?", "Scott Stephenson", "Right. So again, this was Tim's question as well. My comment about moderating price increases related only to one part of what we do insurance, and that's industry-standard insurance programs. And I called it out only because it's a line item that we report separately. So you get to see it. It's a relatively immaterial impact. So hopefully, everybody is clear on that. With respect to the sum of everything that we do in insurance, which is both that as well as all the things that we do in DA insurance, we see '18 as a very positive year. And so the only thing you should add to that, with respect to my '19 comment, is there will be even a little more wind in our sails in '19 with respect to the industry standard insurance programs because of the hardening that is taking place in the premium environment in insurance. So we see '18 as a good extension of what you saw in the latter half of '17. And in '19, there's one macro factor that will actually be positive as we go forward from '18.", "Lee Shavel", "So Manav, just to address some of the comments that I was making, first, the targets that we have set out of 7% to 8% organic revenue growth and the EBITDA expansion beyond that, I think, if you look at the fourth quarter, I think the summary that we offered is that we've achieved those targets even though we continue to have progress to be made at both WoodMac and at Argus. And so that is something that we feel positive about the -- our ability to continue to deliver on those expectations in 2018. And clearly, there is continued upside for us factoring in all of the elements that we discussed.", "Manav Patnaik", "Got it. And then my second question is just more on these organic investments you are making and sort of the time of phasing in which we should expect some of the results. So obviously, Geomni sounds like you've already seen some of the fruition with the extreme weather activity. But when do we see telematics, connected home, all these other things you talk about, start giving you that return you're expecting?", "Scott Stephenson", "Right. So let me start here. And Mark, if you care to add anything. Because -- and something that I'd like to just highlight here is that Geomni and telematics both represent a very important theme inside of our business, and that is new types of data that can be pulled in for new forms of decisioning. And one of the things I want to say from the outset is that both of those data types have application in the insurance vertical. They also have application outside of the insurance vertical. So as you think about how we're going to monetize the investments that we're making, I believe what you'll see is -- I believe what we will see is that they will first express themselves mostly in the insurance vertical, but then as we go forward, they will both expand inside of that vertical, but also find ways to grow in other marketplaces. So that's kind of the general story here. So now back to your question then.", "Yes, we're seeing the fruits of the Geomni investments write down very exciting developments. And so that's really very realtime. We're encouraged by what we see on the IoT front, but it's going to be more of a progressive build in terms of the absolute amount of revenue dollars which are generated by IoT. There are reasons for that, I'll highlight one, Mark, maybe, you'd like to add some others. So we talked about the connected car movement. I feel very, very pleased with the leadership that we're showing in that category. We are the leader in that category. But the rate at the which connected cars grow as a percentage of the total population of cars in the United States, that is a longer-term trend. It will take a while for all of the automakers to essentially have turned over their existing fleets and for all cars to be natively connected. So that's kind of a long -- a big wave, but it's a slow wave or steady wave that is moving through the auto world.", "The effect of IoT in the home, in some ways, may be a little bit faster, but in some ways a little bit slower because of the value associated with the signal that you take off of a car is, in some ways, may be greater than the value of the signal that you take off of a washing machine or a toaster. And so I think IoT -- we are seeing IoT today. It's building, but I think it's kind of a long -- it will be a longer-term sort of a build. Anything you want to add to that, Mark?", "Mark Anquillare", "I think it's well said. I mean, I think the vision is that the rating paradigm will shift as to how automobiles and more importantly people are underwritten in the premiums determined. And we hope to have all that information for every vehicle and every person. At the same time, today, it's a little bit about claims, and so it's a little bit about bespoke modeling to help insurers kind of perfect their own internal behavioral scores.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital.", "Hamzah Mazari", "My first question is just broadly on pricing. I know you mentioned the insurance piece, and it's not significant. But you also mentioned minimizing price increases on cross-selling in WoodMac with some potential in 2019 on pricing. So just broadly speaking, do you guys view pricing as an underappreciated lever for the business as we look long term? Or is it just you have very high market share and pricing is not a huge lever here because of cross-sell?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes. So let me state this in two ways. Pricing is a part of the progression of our revenue every year, including in 2018. I noted the relative degree to which we're making use of the price mechanism in 2018 in one part of what we do in insurance and in energy. But even in that part of insurance and in energy, our pricing is up year-over-year. So please be sure to note that. And then all I would add to that is, in 2019, I believe that there will be, relative to 2018, yet more opportunity where price is concerned for the reasons that I stated. The insurance environment generally hardening on the one hand and Wood Mackenzie's customers continuing to cycle to evermore strength as the commodity cycle has improved. So '18, there is a price effect. It's relatively in line with what was there in '17. I noted the differences. And in '19, I believe the price effect will be even stronger than it was in '18 -- it will be in '18.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Very helpful. And just a follow-up question, maybe for Lee on tax reform. Could you remind us -- I know you gave the book tax rate, 21% to 23%. Could you remind us what the cash tax savings impact is in 2018 from tax reform? And in relation to that, you guys are going through a heavy CapEx cycle and that comes down in 2020 or 2022, I guess. Do you pull forward CapEx because of tax reform rules? Just give us a little more detail on tax reform.", "Lee Shavel", "Sure. Thank you, Hamzah. So the answer to your question on the tax rate, so we would anticipate that the drop in our U.S. tax rate resulting from tax reform will generate approximately an incremental $90 million of additional cash flow in 2018. And with regard to whether that has any impact on our CapEx timing, I think the answer is no, that we view each of those projects as pursuing their natural life and our expectations of investing in them from a business standpoint. So no anticipated change on that front.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.", "George Tong", "You had indicated your overall insurance growth in 2018 should run at a similar pace as the second half of 2017 organically. Given some of the strength in the second half of '17 came from weather-related catastrophe modeling, is the expectation that you'll see incremental strengthening from other areas within insurance?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes, that's right. And Mark, I don't know if you want to expand on that.", "Mark Anquillare", "I think we feel pretty good across all of our businesses. Clearly, we did benefit from the severe weather. It's tough to predict severe weather in the future, so I note your point. But I think we feel like both contract signings, which were strong at the end of 2017. And most of our businesses are deeply engaged with customers and that ultimately pays benefit.", "Scott Stephenson", "You'll remember that Mark started his comments commenting on the claims side of our business. So for example, there's a lot that is in that, that actually is not related to severe weather impacts. And so as we look at the portfolio of solutions across everything we do in insurance, yes, we do see broad performance on to the rate of organic revenue growth and insurance that you've seen in the second half of '17.", "George Tong", "Got it. Very helpful. And then secondly, you've obviously made a number of acquisitions in 2017. Can you elaborate on your overall progress in integrating these acquisitions, particularly as it relates to realizing synergies? And when you might expect these acquisitions to be margin-neutral to the company?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes, so you're actually asking -- yes. And you're asking two very different questions. So one of them is the integrations are well in hand. You'll remember I commented on sort of the three different categories. So there's the category of integration as it relates to image capture, where we needed to create a national capability out of a set of regional businesses. That is substantially achieved. And I was earlier recounting some of the success we had in the fourth quarter of 2017 in using that capability where it was really put to the test because we had -- third and fourth quarter, where we had to move -- we had to keep our feet moving really quickly to keep up with events.", "And so I think we've demonstrated that, that integration has really been achieved. At this point, the margin progression of what we do at Geomni is a function of just growing the business. It is -- it's not entirely a fixed-cost business, but substantially a fixed-cost business. So as we grow it, the margins will naturally ripen. The other question that you were asking was about the likely intermediate and longer-term progression of margins at the acquired businesses. With the more mature businesses, for example, Sequel and PowerAdvocate that we talked about before, their margin profiles are already good. They're not at the level of the rest of Verisk, but we would expect, as they grow, they will tend to move in that direction. And then there's a handful of smaller acquisitions that were more in the nature of product organizations, and we don't necessarily hold those to the test that their margins have to reach the absolute level of the rest of what we do across Verisk. But incrementally, the growth in the EBITDAs will be positive.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.", "William Warmington", "So a question for you on underwriters and automation. There are a number of tech start-ups looking to accelerate automation in underwriting. They have some catchy names, like Pie Insurance and Lemonade. And how does Verisk interact with these start-ups? Do they collaborate, compete, wait and see?", "Lee Shavel", "So I'm happy to start there. I think, first of all, you should understand with a lot of these start-ups, from an InsureTech's perspective, there's two types, right. There's some that are risk-bearing entities. And I will tell you, in many cases, as Scott highlighted, they are customers. There's a couple instances where the amount they spend on us was actually more than they actually wrote in premiums. So those are good relationships, and they're very dependent upon us as they want to become very analytic. I think your other question is really around the InsureTech world that is kind of very blossoming now. And we talk frequently, most of the ones that have started to get a little bit of lift or actually have a customer or two are usually at our door. And I think we are very well in tune with that environment and that world. The other thing I'd like to highlight, I think a lot of our customers, and I think we believe ourselves to be kind of, in many cases, the ultimate InsureTech.", "We do a lot of this. We spend a lot of time on R&D. We have a lot of cutting-edge analytic methods, some in search of application, some with ideas around application, and we share that with customers. And I think that thought leadership is something that is well respected.", "William Warmington", "So for my second question, congratulations on the Honda win. You have 27% share. I guess, my question is, when do you hit the tipping point for more accelerated adoption?", "Lee Shavel", "So I'll do that again. Let me try to highlight. I think we have, for the most part, most insurers now focusing on us as a source of that information. What we need to do, and the industry is going to transition over time, is that not all cars -- as a matter of fact, smaller fraction of cars are connected today. So the way we get information about the car and the vehicle and the driving behavior is a combination of the connected car, which I think is going to be very relevant over the next 5 to 10 years, but also through devices. Your phone has a lot of pertinent information. You opt in. This is all obviously opt-in type of service. And with that information, today, insurers are looking to fine-tune and build models to underwrite. But ultimately, I believe that every pricing decision will tap a database of some form, I hope it to be ours, to understand what that driving behavior was over the past 6 months, and rates and pricing and premiums will change. I think that's the way the rating paradigm will shift for insurance, and we think we're well positioned.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.", "Alex Kramm", "I want to come back to the margin outlook because, quite frankly, I'm still a little bit confused with all the moving pieces. So, Lee, I guess, when you put it all together, the organic expansion, but also kind of the impact of investments and the acquisitions, I mean, where roughly should we be shaking out for the margins? I mean, it sounds like margins should be down overall a little bit. Is it really just a Decision Analytics story? Or is the Risk Assessment also margin decline? So any incremental comment you can give about the magnitude would be helpful.", "Lee Shavel", "Sure. Thanks, Alex. So the way I would summarize it, Alex, and building off of Scott's comments, is that we expect, in 2018, that, on an organic basis, our EBITDA margins should expand. And that is a combination of kind of the total organic business, meaning the core business and the growth initiatives at Geomni and the chemicals and the subsurface at WoodMac and the others that we've described. And so the function of continuing to target the 7% to 8% organic revenue growth and continued improvement in WoodMac and Argus, we believe, will enable us to achieve that EBITDA growth in excess of overall revenue growth. ", "As it relates to the acquisition impact, obviously, that's a variable that is more difficult to anticipate, and the overall net effect will end up being a balancing of what we can achieve from an organic standpoint in terms of margin expansion, offset to some extent by the impact of the acquisitions that are coming on. And so we are trying to give more focus around that organic EBITDA margin, so that you can see meaningfully the progression that we're making in the core business. And then over time, what I would emphasize is that all of the acquisitions that we look at, similar to our business, have great operating leverage. And so that we expect that they will contribute to overall EBITDA growth in those businesses in excess of their organic revenue growth. So hopefully, that answers it. I know that probably what you're looking for is what is the net impact on the acquisitions to the whole, but that becomes that net impact between the 2. The important thing that we feel we want folks to focus on is that organic EBITDA margin, which we feel confident, will expand in 2018.", "Scott Stephenson", "Right. And maybe just to add to that, I write upfront and then Lee also emphasized that we have benefited from the listening tour that Lee has engaged with our investors. And one of the messages that was very clear was that our investors, in general, would like to hear us talk with increased emphasis about organic results, organic revenue growth and organic EBITDA progression. And so you're going to hear that more as a part of our presentation. But we're very excited about the acquisitions also, which are contributing in 2018 to the overall top and bottom line of the company. And we're excited about the contributions they'll make this year and the contributions they'll make in the future. But you're hearing an emphasis on organic because that's what our investors have told us they like us to have.", "Lee Shavel", "And let me add one thing just to allay any concerns. It's not because we don't want to be focused on the financial returns or the acquisitions in -- as I've talked about with a lot of investors, the focus there has to be, \"Are we generating good returns on capital for that component of the business?\" Clearly, it has a financial impact overall, but I want to make certain that we build on the disclosure that we provided at Investor Day around the performance of those entities from a capital standpoint in addition to the financial performance. And so I think that will be something that you'll see in 2018, where we'll be working to enhance disclosure around those components. So just wanted to add that point.", "Alex Kramm", "All right. Looking forward to more disclosures then, I guess. And then secondly, maybe just shifting to WoodMac for a second. I think you gave some commentary at the beginning, Scott, but I think the fourth quarter -- and I think you highlighted it at Investor Day, again, was kind of like the last renewal cycle post kind of cyclical challenges in the energy market. So I think you said it was good renewals. But can you maybe just add a little bit more color if the worse is now behind us, how that last renewal went? And then looking forward, it tells to me like 2018 is still going to be a transition year, but 2019, maybe, we'll get to the point where this can be the fastest-growing business? Or do how you feel about WoodMac, generally speaking?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes, thank you. And you got me substantially correctly in terms of the message at Investor Day. Let me tune it for you just a little bit. So there are -- it's typically the case with WoodMac that there are a lot of renewals in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So the quarter we just went through and the quarter we're going through right now always carry a fair amount of meaning in terms of the progression of the subscriptions year-over-year. So you've heard the report about the fourth quarter, which was a positive quarter overall. And we're in the middle of the first quarter, which feels, I would say, substantially the same. There are some larger customers whose renewals are being negotiated right now.", "So we're moving through that. But you got me substantially correct from Investor Day in terms of as we round out 2017 and into 2018. And I want to emphasize that there are a lot of positive signals at Wood Mackenzie. Lee referenced one that we watch a lot, which is the progression of consulting revenues, which tend to be a leading indicator of our customers' appetite for everything that we can do. And then yes, you also heard me. I think that '19 will be even more removed from the effects of the commodity cycle that we saw in '14, '15, '16 and even into '17. '19 will just be just 1 more year removed from that. And therefore, I do believe that, in addition to all of the new product opportunities and the cross-sell opportunities, I believe that the price mechanism in '19 will be more available to us than it was certainly in the '15, '16, '17 time frame. And we're choosing to be thoughtful about how we use the price mechanism in '18 as well because we want to get these new products sold. We want to enhance the cross-sells.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.", "Andrew Steinerman", "I wanted to know what percentage of Verisk insurance revenues are related to reinsurance clients? And how is that segment of insurance revenues doing?", "Scott Stephenson", "Mark, you want to take that one on?", "Mark Anquillare", "Yes. So first of all, I think what we did experience, and we highlighted a few times in 2017, the reinsurance premiums, it was a very soft market, meaning reinsurers were under pressure. It was difficult for our customers. What that led to was some industry consolidation against -- across a couple of those more major reinsurers. And when 2 become 1, especially on our cat modeling side of the world, that did lose -- it did cause us to lose some revenue as a result of those mergers. So I'm not sure I have an exact answer for you. I would say that in the ISO, or industry-standard programs, insurers, as well as reinsurers, use it, the reinsurer piece rather modest. So I wouldn't call that material at all. But inside of our cat modeling business, that probably represents a rather substantial minority of the revenue, and that's where we experienced a little of that headwind back in 2011.", "Scott Stephenson", "When you said -- can I just add, Mark? When you said it's less than 10% of everything we do across insurance.", "Mark Anquillare", "Across everything, absolutely. I was trying to be a little specific.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "David Ridley-Lane", "Sure. Just following up on some of the comments around WoodMac. I wondering if you could give us an update on the annual contract value trends that you saw in the fourth quarter.", "Scott Stephenson", "And thanks for the question, and that really was our comment before about the progression of the business overall. There is a cumulative effect of contract signings. As you know, WoodMac signs multi-year agreements, but you're seeing the progression in the annual contract values in the reported fourth quarter result, which, as Lee pointed out, is substantially greater than the effect -- the overall outcome for all of 2017. So it has got progression over the course of 2017, and that is because of the effect of the renewals that we're signing in '17. So it's been a positive trend.", "David Ridley-Lane", "And then at Investor Day, you mentioned, I believe, 8 multi-year agreements signed in the Financial Services segment. You, obviously, had another win -- a credit card win in the fourth quarter. Wondering if those contracts had started to yield revenue in the fourth quarter or if that is all to come in 2018.", "Scott Stephenson", "Mostly to come in '18.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW.", "Arash Soleimani", "Just first question is, when you look at improvements in the resolution of satellite imagery, to what extent could that challenge Geomni's aerial imagery offering?", "Scott Stephenson", "Right. We don't see any material risk of substitution at any intermediate period of time, and it's actually likely that it will never be a substitute. And the reason is that you are able to get a degree of precision in your image when you're imaging an object on the face of the earth from, say, 2,000 feet up as opposed to miles and miles up. Two of the major differences, one is geometric. So what you need to be able to do is to be able to observe three-dimensional structure in 3 dimensions. And to be able to do that, you have to image it both oblique -- orthogonally, but also obliquely. When you're miles and miles and miles away, it is very difficult to get an oblique view of anything. So that's the first point. And the second point has to deal with radiometry.", "Basically, any signal that you capture, which is a function of looking through the atmosphere, is going to have different properties than if you're not looking through miles and miles and miles of the atmosphere. So now satellites do have one benefit and that is that potentially you can image the same spot on the face of the earth a couple of times a day potentially with satellites. Now it's not as easy as that because you have to actually -- you actually have to change the commands for the satellite to cause it to image something specific, if it wasn't otherwise going to do that, and that's not necessarily inexpensive, but you do have the potential benefit of frequency. So we think there is a role for satellites, in that they can sort of help you with comprehensive global kinds of general laying the foundation of a set of observations. But in terms of the precision that we need to give the answers that we're giving to our customers, we don't see satellites as a substitute.", "Mark Anquillare", "And maybe just a friendly addition, our solution set includes satellite, aerial, drone, and I'll call it, ground truth, your phones and other type of images. So we are comprehensive in solution.", "Arash Soleimani", "Okay. Great. And just quick numbers question. I know you mentioned the 21% to 23% tax rate. Should we still be using something slightly different for amortization?", "Lee Shavel", "I would recommend that you use the 21% for the amortization of intangibles.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.", "Toni Kaplan", "I want to ask the margin question again in a different way. So you mentioned doubling the training budgets and rewarding employees with the tax savings. That sounds to me like it rolls into OpEx, and so that would impact EBITDA. So just want to confirm that organic EBITDA includes these -- this extra spending.", "Scott Stephenson", "That is correct. It does include those -- these extra categories of spending.", "Toni Kaplan", "Okay. Great. And then I think, when you answered Hamzah's question earlier, the $90 million of savings, is that all going to be spent on this? Or are there other areas as well?", "Scott Stephenson", "I'm sorry. What was it?", "Lee Shavel", "Your question is whether the full $90 million is being spent on the educational opportunities?", "Scott Stephenson", "No. The way I would put it to you, Toni, is that the very vast majority of the tax benefit is available to our shareholders.", "Toni Kaplan", "In the form of buybacks?", "Scott Stephenson", "Well, we'll determine how we're going to deploy capital, but it is free cash flow that is available to invest on behalf of our shareholders, whether it's buybacks or M&A activity.", "Lee Shavel", "It will be deployed in the same process that we use for the capital we generate internally within the business, which is where do we see the best returns on -- returns for that capital across the range of internal investments, external investments and share repurchases.", "Scott Stephenson", "Let me try to summarize. I realize everybody is trying to put it all together really quickly. Let me try again. Lee, keep me honest. Our rate of organic revenue growth in the second half of '17 overall was 7-plus percent. We're happy to compete with that as our benchmark for 2018 overall. Full stop. The second statement is, we expect -- and that's an organic revenue statement, that's the first statement. The second statement is, we expect our rate of organic EBITDA growth to exceed our rate of organic revenue growth, and that is with all of those educational and wealth opportunities for our employees built into what we're talking about.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Joseph Foresi", "I guess what we're wondering is what do you expect the reported margins to be in 2018, up, down or flat? And it sounded like, by your comments, I guess we're wondering how to start our model and maybe any order of magnitude around those. It sounded like, by your comments, that acquisitions could depend on -- or could determine where they end up. Are we really wondering about the reported margin.", "Lee Shavel", "Yes. So Joseph, as we've indicated, we are focused on the organic margin. We expect that to expand. The impact of acquisitions is difficult to predict. We aren't making a prediction or a forward-looking statement as to what the reported impact is. We wouldn't anticipate that, that is going to have a material impact on our overall margins, but it's something that we aren't providing any expectations for 2019 on at this point.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And then you talked a little bit about some contracts that are moving around, and maybe some slowness in FS and energy in the beginning. I'm wondering, could you talk about the cadence of revenues and margins throughout 2018? And do you expect it to be linear? Anything that we should be aware of from contracts rolling on and off? Anything around that nature?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes, let me come back to what I said upfront. We have thousands and thousands of subscription agreements, many of them multi-year. The report that I was providing upfront was that, as we look across all of those, virtually 100% of those relationships are remaining intact in 2018, and the vast majority of those relationships are showing year-over-year progression in growth and value. That's what's happening in our business in 2018.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.", "David Togut", "You've highlighted capital management discipline as the number one point of feedback from your top investors post your listening tour. Could you expand upon that a little bit in terms of how you expect capital allocation priorities to change going forward? Historically, they've been very focused on buyback and acquisitions. Are you going to toggle more toward buyback going forward?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes. So thank you for noting what has been our practice, which is we've always been very comfortable with return -- and we lean into returning capital to shareholders, and we've also found the program of acquisition to be very productive over time. Hopefully, everybody had a chance to see our presentation at the most recent Investor Day, where you saw that, for both the largest deals that we've done over a 10-plus-year time period but also the small and medium ones that we've done, the rate of return on both of those has been in double digits, somewhat higher for, actually, the larger deals. But that whole program has been very productive for our shareholders. So we remain alert to the opportunities.", "At any given moment, we're going to take account of what are the conditions in the market. What is there that when you put it together with Verisk you actually get something special, which is different? Hopefully, you caught the reference in my remarks earlier to the fact that you put PowerAdvocate together with Wood Mackenzie, and you have a significant sale that would not have happened if we had not put those two companies together. So that's the logic behind the M&A program. But of course, we're also going to reference what are prices in the market. And we're going to be thoughtful about ultimately what is the rate of return that we expect for the capital that we invest? And so it's not -- so I think what you can expect from Verisk over long periods of time is a balanced approach, where I believe that it will be the case that it will make sense to return capital and it will make sense to deploy capital thoughtfully in the M&A program. And at any given moment, the balance will be a function of the real-time conditions. I -- hopefully, you've heard Lee say that we definitely expect to be returning capital to shareholders in 2018.", "David Togut", "Understood. As a follow-up, could you update us on your joint venture with Total System Services, Argus and TSYS? And any extent and more broadly of Argus' business in the card issuer processing market in terms of joint ventures in particular?", "Scott Stephenson", "Right. So first of all, we're very pleased with where the TSYS relationship stand, and it is fully on course, exactly what we expected when the relationship was put together last year. And you're right. There are other processors out there in the world. And as you would imagine, we're in dialogue with them. And actually, we have not sort of named all the folks with whom we work even today. So that is a -- there are several companies in that category. We talked about TSYS because it was a large event. They're not the only company with whom we work today in that category. And we are definitely in pursuit of additional relationships in that category.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC.", "Gary Bisbee", "Let me -- I hate to do this, but I need to go back to the margins. So I think we all appreciate the focus on organic, but of course, we model to all-in, including the deals. And I guess I struggle to understand why it's so difficult to project the acquisition. So if we look at the Decision Analytics, nearly 300 basis point margin decline in 2017 and a lot larger decline in Q4, specifically. Can you break out for us, looking backwards, how much of that was deal costs and short-term integration payments that maybe somewhat less likely to recur versus just dilution from bringing on revenue that had an initial lower margin attached to it that will likely persist until you annualize these? And a second part of the question is, how material -- maybe the answer is it's not, but the actual integration spending that you're doing, as you've discussed, a key to a lot of these deals is linking them into your existing systems and offering.", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me take the second part of that and then bump it over to Lee. Integration costs are really not material. And this is an enduring statement about Verisk. And the reason is, if you think about the nature of the integration that needs to be achieved, back to kind of the three buckets that I gave you upfront, when you're talking about product organizations, companies that have unique products that are now a part of Verisk, there are two ways that we link them to us. One of them is getting them on our sales platform, and that integration cost is about nothing. And then the other form of integration is, if and when we integrate the solution, so we have a preexisting encoded solution and the acquired company has an encoded solution, and now you're going to find a way to blend code in order to present a new integrated solution into the marketplace. And those are moment in time.", "Generally, those will be accomplished relatively quickly. And in many ways, you're leveraging the development budgets you've all ready got. It's now you're just thinking a different set of developments because you've now got this bigger code base and you have to bring it all together. So the literal integration is not so great. There's a different part of your question, and here now, I'll turn it over to Lee for his comment, but yes, there are deal costs, for sure. And so when you do deals in the moment, there's all the lawyers and et cetera that have to get paid in order to bring the thing together. So there are definitely deal costs, but the literal tying together of Verisk and the company that we just bought, in an operational sense, generally is not material.", "Lee Shavel", "And so Gary, I think the thing that factors into this is all of the integration upfront costs that we're dealing with that tend to be onetime in nature are an element of this, but there are also two other elements. One is, generally, these are earlier-stage companies, and so they have ability to predict immediately in the near term that -- their immediate performance as we're going through that integration as well as across the number of acquisitions that we have. I think it creates noise that we would suggest is not as relevant to our overall organic performance. And we'd like to focus on that as opposed to trying to predict what that relatively small impact is of those acquisitions. We -- as I indicated, we think that the overall focus should be on the capital efficiency and the returns from that business, and then what they will be able to ultimately contribute on an organic basis when they get folded into the business. So happy to talk more about that with you separately.", "Gary Bisbee", "Yes, I mean, I think the issue, as you probably heard in your tour, is you have a business that's so heavily subscription, people believe you should have extreme visibility relative to a lot of other companies. And the reality of it is, it's been extremely difficult to predict your quarter-to-quarter financial performance. This kind of inability to really be helpful on the forward-looking numbers, I think, it's a big reason why. But I'm sure you've heard that, and I'm sure you're thinking about ways to improve it. So I appreciate the color.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.", "Jeffrey Silber", "I know it's late. I've got one quick question. What should we be modeling for interest expense in 2018?", "Lee Shavel", "Yes. So Jeff, we've specifically not provided guidance around that. I don't think it's going to move materially. But as we're thinking about debt levels and our target aside, I just didn't want to set a specific expectation. I think you can look at the balances and at the rate historically, I don't think it will vary significantly.", "Jeffrey Silber", "And I guess, the lever from the PowerAdvocate acquisition, that's really -- is that on the balance sheet at the end of the year? Or is that not been on the balance sheet yet?", "Lee Shavel", "No, it is on the balance sheet. We funded that substantially with debt.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey", "You've talked about a lot of newer, I would say, growth drivers relative to Verisk's historical businesses. I haven't heard a mention of cyber. And I wonder how you think about cyber risk? And whether there are some organic opportunities to grow in cyber or whether M&A is something you're looking at?", "Scott Stephenson", "Yes. Thanks for the question, and I'll start -- and Mark, if you want to jump in. Cyber is very definitely a part of what we do today. Those of you who are familiar with the P&C insurance industry may be aware that sort of, interestingly, the cyber line -- for all the talk about cyber risk, et cetera, in the world, the cyber line is actually not that highly expressed so far. It's actually -- it's a relatively modest line of insurance. It gets a lot more discussion than it actually gets premium dollars at the moment. We expect cyber will continue to grow as a line, and we already provide modeling of the cyber line, and we have customers for those models. So we're engaged. We're already in that. The 2 interesting questions for us, and Mark, maybe, please feel free to jump in here. Interesting question number one is, how rapidly will the cyber line grow as an insurance offering? But then number two, all the other things that we could potentially do to help operating companies with cyber exposures even beyond helping to manage the insurance policies. So I don't know. Mark, do you want to add anything to that?", "Mark Anquillare", "So we have been kind of the industry standard as it relates to the coverage language in those policies. And I think we have a lot of customers we highlighted at the Investor Day, where I think the more promising future growth is going to be is inside of the models. As people try to grow, and for the most part, underwrite some of that cyber, some of the models, which we historically called cat models, are now being used for, what I'll refer to as, more of the liability side. And cyber is very prominent there. We've made some great progress in working inside of the folks in the London market as well inside of the United States insurers. And that will be a growth driver for us. I would tell you that it's probably more marginal in '18, but it will and should kick up in the future years.", "Scott Stephenson", "Okay. Well, I think we're at the end of the questions. Thank you all very much for enjoying us -- joining us. And we've enjoyed the conversation, look forward to being with you again to report out the next quarter. And Lee will be doing a lot of follow-up with many, many of you. So let's continue to have a dialogue, and thank you very much for your time today.", "Lee Shavel", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.
